It is best known for its \"\" team, which is made up of veteran players from the Brazilian scene, such as FalleN, fer, fnx, boltz and VINI. While the team has changed over time, the 2022 team, nicknamed \"The Last Dance\" (in reference to \"The Last Dance\" series) gained popularity in the run-up to the Rio 2022 Major. The organization also has a \"Crossfire\" team.\n\"Counter-Strike: Global Offensive\".\nHistory.\nOn September 5, 2018, Imperial acquired the \"Counter-Strike\" team from Santos e-Sports. In early 2022, after the contract of all its players expired, the organization signed \"The Last Dance\", a team created by Gabriel \"FalleN\" Toledo that aimed to bring together veterans of the Brazilian competitive scene. Rumors indicated that the initial idea was to bring together the five former members of the team that won two , one for Luminosity Gaming and another for SK Gaming, composed of FalleN, Fernando \"fer\" Alvarenga, Lincoln \"fnx\" Lau, Marcelo \"coldzera\" David and Epitacio \"TACO\" de Melo, however, the last two players already had other projects and chose not to participate. Brazilians Ricardo \"boltz\" Prass and Vinicius \"VINI\" Figueiredo were chosen to complete the team, in addition to Luis \"peacemaker\" Tadeu as coach.\nThe team managed, through the American RMR, to qualify to compete in the PGL Major Antwerp 2022 at the Challengers Stage and then move on to the Legends Stage, where they were eliminated without reaching the playoffs.\nOn August 12, Imperial announced peacemaker's departure from the team due to \"some internal issues within the group\". On August 21, it was announced that fnx would stop playing for the team and would assume the role of coach; he was replaced by Marcelo \"chelo\" Cespedes.\nOn October 9, Imperial secured the remaining 24-team berth of the IEM Rio Major 2022 in a 2–1 closely fought series against North American Complexity Gaming, with the final map being 22–20. The team did not get good results in the tournament and fell in the first phase.\nOn April 2, 2023, Imperial won the BLAST Premier Spring American Showdown and became the representative from the Americas to play in the BLAST Premier Spring Finals. In the Spring Finals, Imperial debuted by winning a 2–0 series against Team Vitality, who had just won the BLAST Paris Major 2023 without dropping a single map. They reached the semifinals of the tournament, where they fell to Heroic 2–1, earning their first major placement in a top-level championship.\nImperial announced the departures of FalleN and chelo on July 3, 2023.\nJOTA was benched from the roster on September 25, 2023. He was replaced by Kaiky \"noway\" Santos on October 8."

He played youth rugby at Westcliff, later earning a scholarship to Berkhamsted School. This would eventually lead to his recruitment into the Saracens academy.\nClub career.\nAfter progressing through the junior ranks and into the Saracens senior academy, Knight made his initial first-team appearances in the pool stages of the 2021–22 Premiership Rugby Cup, before his Premiership debut followed away to Gloucester in June 2022, at the end of the 2021–22 regular season. In these matches, he was deployed both as a flanker and as a Number 8. Before the start of the 2022–23 season, Knight was promoted into the Saracens first-team squad on a full-time basis. During this season, he was also dual-registered with Ampthill in the RFU Championship.\nHe helped Saracens win the Premiership title in 2023, and was an unused replacement in the final as Saracens defeated Sale Sharks.\nInternational career.\nKnight has represented England at age-group level, including a call-up to the England U18s when he was just 17. He was also part of the England U20s squad for the 2022 Six Nations and their subsequent summer series that year. During the U20s Six Nations, Knight captained England on several occasions, notably on his debut appearance against Scotland U20s, when he scored two tries on the way to a 41–24 victory."

It was arranged with the special cooperation of Toshiba with official naming rights. The draft was officially called \"The Professional Baseball Draft Meeting supported by TOSHIBA \".It has been sponsored by Toshiba for the 2nd consecutive year since 2009.\nSummary.\nOnly the first round picks will be done by bid lottery. After the second round, waver selections were made in order from the lowest-ranked team of the 2011 season in both the Central League and Pacific League, the third round was reversed and selections were made from the top team, and the fourth round was reversed again, alternating with selections from the lowest-ranked team until all teams had finished selecting players.\nSince the season, the winner of the NPB All-Star Game has determined whether the Central League or the Pacific League gets waiver preference after the second round. In the 2010 All-Star Game, the Central League and Pacific League had a 1-1-1 tie, but regulations gave the Central League waiver priority over the Pacific League. \nAttention was focused on candidates such as Tatsuya Oishi, Yuki Saito, Hirokazu Sawamura, and other college-age right-handed pitchers. Under the circumstances, the Yomiuri Giants publicly announced that they would pick Sawamura in the first round, and Sawamura also expressed his refusal to negotiate if he was picked by a team other than the Giants. As a result, other teams backed away from Sawamura, and the Giants picked him alone. The Giants' approach was criticized."

        "text": "The 2023 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2023 National Rugby League season in Australia. It was contested between the Penrith Panthers and the Brisbane Broncos on Sunday the 1st of October at Accor Stadium in Sydney. Penrith, who were the two-time defending premiers and the defending minor premiers, won the match 26–24 to claim their fifth premiership title, and became the first club in forty years to win three consecutive first-grade premierships following the Parramatta Eels in 1983. Panthers halfback Nathan Cleary, who scored the winning try for his team, was awarded his second Clive Churchill Medal for being judged as the man of the match. The match gained significant notoriety for featuring the largest comeback victory in grand final history, with the Panthers overcoming a 24-8 deficit after 56 minutes by scoring 18 unanswered points to ultimately win the match.\nThe match was preceded by the 2023 NRL State Championship and the 2023 NRL Women's Grand Final. The match was broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network.\nBackground.\nThis was the first NRL grand final between the Penrith Panthers and the Brisbane Broncos, and the first to feature both a New South Wales and Queensland based side since 2005. Their last clash in a finals series was in 2017, with the Broncos winning 13–6. The Panthers became the first side since the Melbourne Storm in 2009 to reach four consecutive grand finals, and were vying for their fifth premiership title after defeating the Canberra Raiders in 1991, Sydney Roosters in 2003, South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2021 and Parramatta Eels in 2022. It was Ivan Cleary's fifth grand final appearance as a coach, with two prior losses (NZ Warriors v Manly 2011 and Penrith Panthers v Melbourne Storm 2020) and two prior wins coaching Penrith (v Souths 2021/Parramatta 2022) leading into the 2023 decider.\nThe Broncos were aiming for their seventh premiership victory; their most recent being against the Melbourne Storm in 2006. Their last grand final appearance was a defeat to the North Queensland Cowboys in 2015. The match was Kevin Walters' first grand final appearance as a coach, becoming only the second person, after Wayne Bennett, to coach the Broncos to a grand final.\nThe grand final was a highly anticipated match-up between the top two teams of the regular season, with both teams finishing the regular season with eighteen wins and six losses, and Panthers claiming the minor premiership with a far superior points differential. Both teams also achieved dominant wins against the third-placed Melbourne Storm and fourth-placed New Zealand Warriors in their preceding qualifying and preliminary finals matches.\nRoute to the final.\nPenrith Panthers.\nThe 2023 Penrith Panthers season was the 57th season in the club's history. Coached by Ivan Cleary and co-captained by Nathan Cleary and Isaah Yeo, the club played their home games at BlueBet Stadium in Penrith.\nBrisbane Broncos.\nThe 2023 Brisbane Broncos season was the 36th in the club's history.

The Australian national anthem was performed by Tim Omaji.\nCo-headlining with the cast of the musical were Indigenous Australian rock band King Stingray, who also provided the soundtrack for Fox League's 2023 Finals advertising campaign.\nOfficiating.\nAdam Gee refereed his first NRL grand final, with touch judges Chris Sutton and David Munro. Ashley Klein was the bunker official.\nAttendance.\nGrand Final tickets went on sale in early August, with club allocations released following the Preliminary Finals on Monday, September 25. The game was officially sold out a day later. 81,947 people attended.\nCurtain-raiser matches.\nCurtain-raiser matches on the day were the NRL State Championship between the Brisbane Tigers and the South Sydney Rabbitohs, and NRL Women's Grand Final between the Newcastle Knights and the Gold Coast Titans. Both were shown live on the Nine Network in Australia.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;section begin=scoreboard/&gt;&lt;section end=scoreboard/&gt;\n&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nBoth teams played aggressively in the opening exchanges, dominated by brutal hit-ups and tackles from the forwards. Penrith had the better share of the early possession and field position, courtesy of several handling errors by Brisbane players. However, due to strong Brisbane scramble defence on their own line, Penrith were unable to score any points until the 17th minute when an attempted short kick-off by Adam Reynolds was knocked back by Herbie Farnworth, and with no Broncos player in position to gather the loose ball, it bounced back towards the try line and was picked up by Mitch Kenny to score the opening try of the match unmarked. Brisbane managed to find some field position and momentum, managing to score through Thomas Flegler in the dying seconds of the first half and leaving the score 8–6 at half-time.\nThe second half started with a 10 minute hat-trick by Broncos five-eighth Ezra Mam, which left the score at 24–8 in favour of the Broncos. With star players Jarome Luai (shoulder), Isaah Yeo and Scott Sorensen (both HIA) forced off the field due to injury, and staring at a 16 point deficit with only 20 minutes of the match remaining, the Panthers looked to be in an almost impossible situation. However, in the 62nd minute, Penrith halfback Nathan Cleary forced a clean line-break on the Brisbane 40m line, fending off former teammate Kurt Capewell and passing back inside to Moses Leota in support who scored under the goalposts. With the try converted, the score was left at 24–14 to the Broncos.\nOn the next set, the Penrith halfback kicked a 40/20 on the 3rd tackle. Whilst unable to directly capitalise, this provided field position for the Panthers. An error by Broncos lock Patrick Carrigan on the half-way line handed Penrith another opportunity in attacking field position. In the 67th minute, Nathan Cleary found a long pass to a rushing Stephen Crichton, catching the ball on the 10m line, placing a strong right-hand fend on the chest of opposing centre Kotoni Staggs and powering his way through another two would-be defenders to roll over the try line. This was his fourth consecutive try in NRL Grand Finals, in his 100th and final game for the Panthers. With Cleary successfully converting from close to the side-line, the deficit had now been reduced to 24-20.\nBrisbane continued to play their expansive style of football, with Reece Walsh managing a line-break with 10 minutes to go. However Dylan Edwards, the Panthers fullback made a cover tackle on Walsh, stopping an almost certain try in the last line of defence. With a handover on their own 20m line, the Panthers found their way forwards to the Brisbane 40m line, where centre Stephen Crichton placed a kick over the defence, finding Reece Walsh out of position in defence and chasing his own kick to force Walsh back into the in-goal. On the drop-out, Reynolds' kick went out on the full, and Panthers elected to take the penalty tap. The attacking set following ended with a grubber collected by Selwyn Cobbo, and Brisbane then managing to return the ball up to their own 40m line.\nWith five minutes remaining, Stephen Crichton forced yet another line drop-out with a precise grubber into the corner, and Sunia Turuva tackling Kotoni Staggs back into the in-goal. This repeat set would prove decisive, where on the fifth play, dummy-half Mitch Kenny passed the ball on the short side to his co-captain Nathan Cleary, who identified a tiring Broncos defence, stepping around four defenders and bursting through a last-ditch tackle from Reece Walsh to score the match-winning try with only two minutes remaining.\nAfter the conversion, the Broncos had one final set to win, in which they had to advance 82m. On the fourth tackle, Reece Walsh seemed to find space but was tackled by Stephen Crichton. Walsh attempted to pass an offload, however the pass was taken by Scott Sorensen, sealing the result for Penrith.\nFor his match-winning performance, Nathan Cleary was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal, which he had previously won in 2021 also. His second-half efforts have also been described by commentators and fans alike to be the best solo grand final performance in history. It was later revealed that Cleary suffered a knee injury in the tenth minute of play.\nStatistics.\nThe 16 point comeback achieved by the Penrith Panthers is the greatest in grand final history, surpassing a previous record held by Melbourne Storm since 1999, the Melbourne's comeback from 14 points down against St George Illawarra in 1999, as the biggest-ever in a decider The Panthers overturned a 24-8 deficit into a 26–24 final score in the final 20 minutes of the match.\nPost-match.\nAs winners of the match, Penrith Panthers earned the right to play in the World Club Challenge against 2023 Super League Grand Final winners.\nThe Panthers farewelled triple premiership winners and local juniors Stephen Crichton and Spencer Leniu, who departed for the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs and Sydney Roosters respectively. Bench five-eighth Jack Cogger left for the Newcastle Knights after a single season at Penrith, while utility player Jaeman Salmon also left to join Crichton at the Bulldogs. While he did not feature in the 2023 Grand Final, he did win a premiership in 2022 with Penrith.\nOpening matches.\nTwo opening matches were played on the ground prior to the grand final: the NRL State Championship and NRL Women's Grand Final. Both matches were broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network."

Before this series, Queensland had won 23 times, NSW 16 times, with two series drawn.\nVenues.\nGame I was held in Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval, game II in Brisbane at the Suncorp Stadium, and game III in Sydney at Accor Stadium.\nThe series returned to Adelaide for a second time, after the Adelaide Oval hosted the first match of the 2020 State of Origin series.\nGame I.\nGame I was held at Adelaide Oval in Adelaide.\nThe return of blues centre Latrell Mitchell was pushed back due to Mitchell suffering a calf injury. Stephen Crichton replaced him at starting left centre, and Matt Burton was added into the Game I extended bench.\nNew South Wales entered the game as slight favourites, however any hopes of an easy win were vaporised early when Hamiso Tabuai-Fidow and Selwyn Cobbo crossed for Queensland in the 7th and 10th minutes respectively, giving the Maroons an early 10-0 lead.\nDespite enjoying 56% possession and 74% territory in the first half, the Blues could only manage one try as they went into the sheds down 10-6. The try came when maligned five-eighth Jarome Luai threw a perfect pass for club teammate and second rower Liam Martin to burst through a hole and plant the ball down.\nIt was a dream start to the second half for New South Wales, with Maroons centre Valentine Holmes forcing an offload that was picked up by Blues hooker Api Koroisau, who streaked away to give his side the lead for the first time in the match.\nIt lasted until the 56th minute, when Cobbo went in for his second try, beating defenders Luai and James Tedesco in the process.\nThe game was clearly in the balance, and it looked as if the Blues would cruise home when Stephen Crichton's try in the 66th minute was followed by a sin-bin to Maroons forward Tom Flegler in the 68th minute for a dangerous tackle on Tom Trbojevic, meaning New South Wales would play the bulk of the final minutes against 12 men while already possessing a two-point lead.\nAdd to that, the Maroons would finish the game with both wingers off the field due to injury, with Cobbo going off in the 67th minute and Murray Taulagi in the 72nd. The Blues would also be forced into a late backline change, with Trbojevic off with an HIA in the 68th minute, replaced by Nicho Hynes.\nDespite all the adversity, it would be the Maroons who romped home to take the win in the end, with Cameron Munster beating Hynes to set up Tabuai-Fidow for his second try in the 73rd minute. Queensland would seal it a few minutes later, with prop forward Lindsay Collins sensationally leaping over Blues fullback and Roosters team-mate Tedesco to catch the ball and offload to Munster, who scored the try.\nQueensland forward Reuben Cotter was named man of the match, playing 80 minutes and finishing with the stats of 10 runs for 84 metres, a tackle break and 48 tackles with only 3 misses.\nGame II.\nGame II was held at Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane.\nGame III.\nGame III was held at Accor Stadium in Sydney.\nWomen's State of Origin.\nTeams.\nNew South Wales Blues.\nNotes: "

For the series, England and Australia faced each other in one Test, three One Day International (ODI) and three Twenty20 International (T20I) matches. The ODI series formed part of the 2022–2025 ICC Women's Championship tournament. A points-based system was used across all three formats of the tour to determine the winner of the Ashes series. The Test match at Trent Bridge was the first ever women's Test in England and second overall to be scheduled for five days of play. Australia were the defending champions, having won the 2021–22 Women's Ashes series 12–4.\nAustralia won the only Test match by 89 runs. It was the first women's Test match to not end in a draw since 2015, breaking a streak of six consecutive drawn Tests. Australia also won the first T20I by four wickets, which meant that England needed to win all five of the remaining matches in the series in order to regain the Ashes. England won the second and third matches to claim the T20I leg of the series 2–1. This was the first T20I series defeat for Australia since the 2017–18 Ashes series. England levelled the Ashes points tally by winning the first ODI by two wickets. Australia won the second ODI by just three runs to retain the Ashes, despite an unbeaten century by Nat Sciver-Brunt. Sciver-Brunt scored a second consecutive century in the third ODI, which England won by 69 runs. England won the ODI series 2–1, inflicting Australia's first ODI series defeat since 2013.\nThe Ashes series ended as a draw, with both teams earning eight points.\nSquads.\nOn 27 May 2023, Australia's Meg Lanning was ruled out of tour due to medical reasons. In her absence, Alyssa Healy was named as Australia's captain and Tahlia McGrath was named as the vice-captain for the tour.\nOn 20 June 2023, both Alice Capsey and Alice Davidson-Richards were removed from England's Test squad to enable them to play for England A."

He played college football at Oregon, Garden City CC, Kentucky, and New Mexico. He played for the Houston Gamblers of the United States Football League (USFL) from 2022 to 2023.\nEarly years.\nWilson was born in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and grew up there.

He was named All-Midlands Region by \"The Oklahoman\" and was ranked as the second-best prospect in the state by \"Tulsa World\" and the former.\nCollege career.\nOregon.\nA four-star recruit, Wilson initially committed to Nebraska, but then changed his mind and instead signed with Oregon. After redshirting his first year, 2016, he decided to transfer to Garden City Community College, partially because of the departure of coach Scott Frost and because he \"sensed the fit wasn't right\" with Oregon.\nGarden City CC.\nWilson played one season, 2017, at Garden City, and threw for 2,133 yards and 26 touchdowns while completing 57.6% of his pass attempts. Additionally, he ran for 518 yards and scored five touchdowns, on his way to being named Jayhawk Conference Offense Player of the Year. He placed sixth nationally for junior colleges in passing touchdowns and was first in the conference in efficiency.\nKentucky.\nWilson transferred to Kentucky for his sophomore season, 2018, and became their starting quarterback in his first year with the team. He ended up starting all 13 games, and led them to their first ten-win season since 1977. He threw 11 touchdowns and completed 180 out of 268 pass attempts, with a 67.2 completion rate. He also placed second on the roster in rushing yards with 547, and became the first Kentucky player in history to have over 1,500 passing yards and over 500 rushing yards in the same year. After the game against Florida, Wilson was named the Manning Player of the Week. He also earned the Howard Schnellenberger Award for being most valuable player of the Governor's Cup.\nIn the second game 2019, Wilson suffered a season-ending torn patellar tendon against Eastern Michigan. Before the injury, he had thrown for 360 yards and two touchdowns on 33 completions. He recovered in time for the 2020 season and started all but one game, passing for 1,187 yards and seven touchdowns with four interceptions. He helped them compile a 5–6 record in a season shortened by COVID-19, and also ran for 424 yards and scored five touchdowns.\nNew Mexico.\nAfter being given an extra year of eligibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Wilson decided to transfer to New Mexico for his final season. He ended his time with Kentucky as the only player in team history with over 3,000 passing yards and 1,000 rushing yards. In August 2021, Wilson was named New Mexico's starting quarterback, having won the training camp position battle. He appeared in seven games, six as a starter, before suffering a season-ending elbow injury midway through the year. He had completed 101 passes for 1,058 yards and seven touchdowns before getting injured. Wilson finished his NCAA career with 4,494 passing yards and 27 touchdowns, along with 1,047 rushing yards and 11 scores.\nProfessional career.\nHouston Gamblers.\nWilson was not selected in the 2022 NFL Draft. He later was invited to the Dallas Cowboys rookie minicamp, but was not signed. On May 27, 2022, Wilson was signed by the Houston Gamblers of the United States Football League (USFL). He made an appearance in one game during the season. He was released on September 19, 2023.\nWinnipeg Blue Bombers.\nOn November 29, 2023, Wilson signed with the Winnipeg Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League (CFL)."

In October 1986, she met two members of the Richmond Women’s rugby team in a night out and was told that they needed tall players like her. She found an old pair of lacrosse boots and attended her first training at Richmond where she met Deborah Griffin, Sue Dorrington and Mary Forsyth.\nCooper became part of the Organising Committee for the inaugural Women’s Rugby World Cup in 1991. She was an obvious choice for Press officer because she was a regular contributor to \"Rugby World &amp; Post\" where she had her own column about the women’s game. Cooper devoted countless hours creating media coverage for the tournament, and was often found at the National Sports Centre for Wales typing up team sheets and match reports, organising the printing of programmes, and handling media calls.\nCooper's playing career came to an end in 1993 after she suffered a broken leg while captaining the Richmond sevens team.\nWorld Rugby Hall of Fame.\nCooper, Dorrington, Griffin, and Forsyth will be inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in a special ceremony during the 2021 Rugby World Cup semi-finals at Eden Park on 5 November 2022."

        "text": "Taylor House (born September 29, 1998) is an American professional ice hockey player, currently playing in the Swedish Women's Hockey League (SDHL) with MoDo Hockey Dam. She previously played in the Premier Hockey Federation (PHF) with the Boston Pride and her college ice hockey career was played with the Quinnipiac Bobcats women's ice hockey program in the ECAC Hockey conference of the NCAA Division I.\nPlaying career.\nAs a teen, House played in the Tier 1 Elite Hockey League (T1EHL) with Chicago Fury junior teams. She won the T1EHL under-16 (U16) Championship with the Chicago Fury U16 in 2014 and was a two-time Can/Am Tournament Champion. House was invited to USA Hockey Player Development Camps in 2012, 2013, and 2014, and was selected to attend the USA Hockey 2015 Girls U18 Select Player Development Camp – also known as the 'U18 Select 66 Camp' or 'Top 66' in reference to the number of players invited – in Biddeford, Maine. While playing with the Chicago Fury U19, House committed to Quinnipiac University in 2015 and scored 48 goals in 2016–17, her final season of midget major.&lt;ref name=\"QU_21/22roster\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nNCAA.\nShe joined the Quinnipiac Bobcats women's ice hockey program as an incoming freshman in the 2017–18 season. Ahead of House's debut with the team, program head coach Cassandra Turner described her as a \"big, strong power forward… [who] pressures the puck, wins battles and competes in all three zones… she also possesses a unique creativity and touch around the net.\" As a rookie, she tallied a total of 7 points on 4 goals and 3 assists and recorded 13 blocked shots across 35 games. She ranked fifth in team scoring in the 2018–19 season, with 9 goals and 6 assists for 15 points in 34 games, and scored the team's only short-handed goal of the season. Her point totals in the 2019–20 season were identical to the previous season (9+6=15), good for tenth in team scoring as the team saw increased offensive production from other players, and she recorded her first positive plus–minus for a season, with a +10 across 31 games.\nThe 2020–21 season saw the number of games halved due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the truncated season played host to House's offensive breakout. She matched her point total from the previous two seasons, with 7 goals and 8 assists in just 16 games – tying Taylor Girard for most goals on the team and ranking third for team scoring. Presented with the opportunity to play a fifth year of NCAA college eligibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she opted to remain with the Quinnipiac Bobcats as a graduate student. The 2021–22 season built on the previous season's highs and House set personal records in every offensive metric, netting 16 goals and 10 assists for 26 points in 39 games (second on the team for goals and fourth for points).\nHouse concluded her college career playing in the most successful late-season in Bobcats history, which culminated in their NCAA tournament quarterfinal debut. She scored in each of the final five games of her career, netting 4 goals and 3 assists during the ECAC quarterfinals through the 2022 NCAA women's ice hockey tournament.\nAcross her five-season career with the Bobcats, House's teammates included future PHF players Sarah-Ève Coutu-Godbout, Taylor Girard, Abbie Ives, Anna Kilponen, Randi Marcon, Melissa Samoskevich, Kati Tabin, and future Boston Pride teammate Corinne Schroeder.\nProfessional.\nHouse signed her first professional contract with the Boston Pride in October 2022. The one-year contract had a salary valued at $29,000 and featured a $2,900 signing bonus. She earned her first PHF point – the primary assist on Becca Gilmore's first PHF goal – in a Pride home game against the Toronto Six on November 26, 2022. Her first PHF goal was scored in an away game against the Buffalo Beauts on December 10, 2022, with assists from McKenna Brand and Kaleigh Fratkin.\nPersonal life.\nHouse was born and raised in Joliet, Illinois, a city southwest of Chicago. She attended secondary school at Minooka Community High School and played on the school's ice hockey team.\nDuring her time as a graduate student at Quinnipiac, House was roommates with Taylor Girard, who was then playing her first season with the Connecticut Whale.\nCareer statistics.\nRegular season and playoffs.\n\"Note: Statistics for junior ice hockey career are incomplete.\"\nSources:\nAwards and honors.\nWeekly awards.\nECAC Hockey Player of the Week"

In the championship game, the Clemson Tigers defeated the Miami Hurricanes, 11-5, earning the league's automatic bid to the 2023 NCAA Division I baseball tournament. Due to inclement weather, one game, the first semifinal, was hosted at Boshamer Stadium in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nThe tournament has been held every year but two since 1973, with Clemson winning ten championships prior this, the most all-time. Georgia Tech has won nine championships, and Florida State has won eight titles since its entry to the league in 1992, matching defending champion North Carolina's total. Recent entrants Virginia Tech, Boston College, Pittsburgh, Notre Dame and Louisville have never won the event.\nFormat and seeding.\nThe winner of each seven team division and the top ten other teams based on conference winning percentage, regardless of division, from the conference's regular season will be seeded one through twelve. Seeds one and two are awarded to the two division winners. Teams are then divided into four pools of three teams each, with the winners advancing to single elimination bracket for the championship.\nIf a 1–1 tie were to occur among all three teams in a pool, the highest seeded team would have advanced to the semifinals. Because of this, seeds 5–12 must win both pool play games to advance to the single-elimination bracket, and seeds 1–4 must only win the game against the winner of the game between the other two teams in the pool to advance. For example, if the 12 seed beats the 8 seed in the first game, then the winner of the 12 seed versus 1 seed advances, and the 8 seed versus 1 seed game has no effect on which team advances.\nSchedule and Results.\nSchedule.\nSource:\nAll Tournament Team.\nSource:"

        "text": "The 2023 Major League Cricket season (also known as MLC 2023) was the inaugural season of the Major League Cricket, a franchise Twenty20 cricket league established in 2019 by American Cricket Enterprises (ACE) in the United States. The season was hosted at two venues, Grand Prairie Stadium in Grand Prairie, Texas and Church Street Park in Morrisville, North Carolina. The season was played from July 13 to 30, 2023, with MI New York defeating the Seattle Orcas by seven wickets to win the inaugural title.\nBackground.\nMajor League Cricket announced in November 2022 that its inaugural season would be played at Grand Prairie Stadium starting July 13 and concluding July 30. MLC also revealed that the tournament would be played in a single round-robin format with fifteen league matches played among six franchises before a four-match play-off phase.\nIn March 2023, the teams for the tournament were announced ahead of the league's inaugural draft—called the Texas Super Kings, the Seattle Orcas, the Los Angeles Knight Riders, the Washington Freedom, the MI New York and the San Francisco Unicorns, respectively. The draft for the season was then held on March 19, with Harmeet Singh being picked first overall and Aaron Finch and Quinton de Kock among others highlighting the draft. In the buildup to the season opener, teams signed multiple other players including Jason Roy, Adam Zampa and Moises Henriques.\nIn April, USA Cricket—the governing body of cricket in the United States—officially sanctioned the tournament following a dispute with tournament organizers, American Cricket Enterprises, that threatened to delay the launch of MLC. Tournament fixtures were announced on June 12—nearly two months later. In addition, it also revealed that the tournament would be held at two venues, Grand Prairie Stadium and Church Street Park for the group stage, while all play-off matches and the final would be held at Grand Prairie Stadium. Tickets for the matches were also made available on the same day.\nTeams.\nTeams were announced by MLC in March 2023, with team coaches and captains being announced in the months following.\nSquads.\nA minimum of 16 players and a maximum of 19 players can be selected by the teams with a maximum of nine overseas players.\nThe teams can select nine local players in the draft and another one as a wildcard. \nVenues.\nMatches were held at two venus: Grand Prairie's Grand Prairie Stadium, with a capacity of 7,000 (expandable to 15,000) and Morrisville, North Carolina's Church Street Park, with a capacity of 3,500\nLeague stage.\n \n&lt;section begin=match1/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match2/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match3/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match4/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match5/&gt;\n &lt;section begin=match6/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match7/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match8/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match9/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match10/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match11/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match12/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match13/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match14/&gt;\n&lt;section begin=match15/&gt;&lt;section end=match15/&gt;\nAwards.\nOn July 28, 2023, a list of end of season awards was announced.\nBroadcasting.\nIn July 2023, Major League Cricket (MLC) announced that its inaugural season will be broadcast live in major cricketing nations."

It included appearances by Morgan Freeman and Ghanim Al-Muftah, and a performance by South Korean singer Jungkook of BTS.\nCeremony.\nItalian creative director Marco Balich, who previously worked on several Olympic opening and closing ceremonies, collaborated with co-artistic director Akhmed Al Baker during production.\nThe ceremony included many symbolic indications that express welcome, generosity and hospitality in Arab culture, as well as contemporary musical, cultural and visual performances that were used for the first time in the tournament, under a “Tent” decoration that represents the Earth, in a message to invite the world to meet and unite. The ceremony, which lasted for about 30 minutes, was dominated by Arab states of the Persian Gulf and Arab heritage.\nPanels.\nThe ceremony included seven panels that merged the Qatari and international cultures, showing the country's culture and values, the importance of respecting the other, and the need to change the misconception about the Arab world.\nThe first panel, \"The Calling\", depicted the sound of \"El-Hoon\", which is associated with receiving guests. During the \"To Get to Know\" panel, Qatari personality Ghanim Al-Muftah engaged in a conversation with American artist Morgan Freeman, during which Al-Muftah recited verse 13 of Surat Al-Hujurat:\ncalling for acceptance of difference and diversity among human beings, within a framework of peace and love.\nThe \"Rhythm of Nations\" panel combined Qatari music with the most famous cheers of encouragement for the 32 participating teams. This was followed by the \"Football Nostalgia\" panel, which collects former official mascots in honour of the previous host countries of the World Cup, followed by the \"Dreamers\" panel, which included performances by member of the Korean band BTS, Jungkook, who was later joined by Qatari artist Fahad Al Kubaisi.\nAn archival historical film was shown for the first time during the \"Roots of the Dream\" panel, showing the former Emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani, playing football with a group of his friends. The ceremony concluded with the panel \"Here and Now\", which consisted of a speech by the Emir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and ended with the appearance of the official logo of the 2022 FIFA World Cup at a height of 15 meters coupled with a fireworks display.\nDignitaries in attendance.\nA number of foreign politicians and dignitaries attended the opening ceremony, including 17 heads of state, government and international organizations.\nControversies.\nRefusal of broadcast.\nIn light of the allegations of human rights abuses and corruption scandal surrounding the World Cup, the British public service broadcaster BBC refused to broadcast the opening ceremony on television, although it was made available through its online and digital TV services."

It was recorded in January 2002 in New York City, and was released in 2005 by Golden Beams Productions.\nReception.\nIn a review for AllMusic, Michael G. Nastos wrote: \"Suso and... DeJohnette team up in duets that do not juxtapose, but complement the rhythmic strengths of the different instruments, creating a language of their own... It is a consistent and playful dialogue between two incredible musicians who need no definitions, restrictions, or guidance to make their spare, soulful, diverse, and heartfelt original music happen.\"\nJohn Kelman of \"All About Jazz\" stated: \"while both artists look for a nexus point, neither is prepared to completely give up his own disposition, making \"Music from the Hearts of the Masters\" a unique experience. Suso's kora is so richly textured that it's hard not to be drawn in, while DeJohnette's groove-laden kit work creates an equally inviting space.\" \"AAJ\"'s Franz A. Matzner commented: \"A work of rare spiritual and musical clarity, \"Music from the Hearts of the Masters\" possesses a quiet strength which grounds Suso's often abstract, sometimes esoteric excursions to create a uniquely contemplative—almost meditative—experience.\"\nWriting for \"PopMatters\", Will Layman noted that the album \"is essentially meditative and calming in tone. Unlike both jazz and European music, it does not tell a story with a set-up, development and a climax. Like a constantly moving spiral it draws us down to its essence rather than out to its conclusion.\" He concluded: \"DeJohnette has more than earned the right to play with whomever and however he likes. It's great that he's getting to call his own shots.\"\nA reviewer for \"Spellbinding Music\" remarked: \"the chemistry unfolding between Foday Musa Suso and Jack DeJohnette is a joy to watch and listen to. Both players manage to generate a unique musical idiom that is neither Jazz nor traditional African, but both highly rhythmic and melodic at the same time.\""

        "text": "The women's downhill in the 2023 FIS Alpine Skiing World Cup consisted of nine events, including the final. The original schedule called for eleven events, but the first two races of the season scheduled for 5 and 6 November 2022 in Zermatt/Cervinia (on the Matterhorn, which would have crossed an international border between the start (in Switzerland) and the finish (in Italy)), were canceled due to adverse weather conditions; the FIS decided not to reschedule them. Once the season began, a downhill scheduled in St. Anton on 14 January had to be converted into a Super-G due to the inability to hold a pre-race training run on either of the two days prior to the downhill. However, a subsequent Super-G scheduled at Cortina d'Ampezzo was converted into a downhill, restoring the original schedule.\nThree-time discipline champion (and two-time defending champion) Sofia Goggia of Italy won four of the first five downhills, similar to the prior two seasons, and established a lead of more than 200 points. Goggia was the only skier to reach the podium in all five races, as she finished second in the race that she did not win. After winning the race in Crans Montana, Switzerland, Goggia held a lead of 179 points over 2017 discipline champion Ilka Štuhec of Slovenia, with only two races remaining. In the next downhill in Kvitfjell, Goggia's runner-up finish secured her third straight discipline championship (and fourth overall).\nThe season was interrupted by the 2023 World Ski Championships in the linked resorts of Courchevel and Méribel, France from 6–19 February 2023. Although the Alpine Skiing branch of the International Ski Federation (FIS) conducts both the World Cup and the World Championships, the World Championships are organized by nation (a maximum of four skiers is generally permitted per nation), and (after 1970) the results count only for World Championship medals, not for World Cup points. Accordingly, the results in the World Championship are highlighted in blue and shown in this table by ordinal position only in each discipline. The women's downhill was held in Méribel on 11 February.\nThe World Cup finals took place on Wednesday, 15 March in Soldeu, Andorra, which also hosted the finals in 2019. Only the top 25 skiers in the World Cup downhill discipline and the winner of the Junior World Championship, plus any skiers who have scored at least 500 points in the World Cup overall classification for the season, were eligible to compete in the discipline final, and only the top 15 earned World Cup points."

It was conceived as more than simply a club for athletics and other sports, but also a federation of existing clubs. On 7 July 1873 the ICAC held its first 'Championships of All Ireland' meeting at College Park, Trinity College Dublin.\nHowever, Trinity College complained about the lack of consulation, and refused permission for any further ICAC events, this lead Dunlop to seek a new location to stage future championships. In December 1873 he found an 8.5 acre site close to Lansdowne Road station owned by George Herbert, 13th Earl of Pembroke and agreed a lease with him.\nIn 1875 Dunlop founded the All Ireland Lawn Tennis Club under the ICAC auspices at Landsdowne, Dublin, Ireland.

The top three teams of the tournament qualified for the 2025 FIVB Volleyball Men's World Championship as the CEV representatives, except Italy who had already qualified as the defending world champions.\nPoland won their second title after defeating hosts Italy 3–0 in the final.

The only arena that was suitable for the championships was indoor arena Yunist in Zaporizhzhia.\nOn 5 October 2022, CEV announced that Israel would be the new co-host of the tournament replacing Ukraine. In July 2023, CEV made the unprecedented and controversial move of donating €1,500,000 to ensure the smooth running of the EuroVolley 2023 Group D stages in Israel amid rumours that Israel might withdraw from its hosting duties due to \"financial difficulties\". This is in contrast to the other host nations who reportedly spent between €600,000 and €2,000,000 for the organization of the championship.\nOn 9 February 2023, CEV announced that Rome would host the semifinals and medal matches, while Bologna would also host the opening match between Belgium and Italy.\nPools composition.\nThe drawing of lots is combined with a seeding of National Federations and performed as follows:\nThe drawing of lots was held on 16 November 2022 in Naples, Italy.\nPool standing procedure.\nMatch won 3–0 or 3–1: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser\nMatch won 3–2: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match point for the loser"

        "title": "2023 Ashes series",
        "text": "The 2023 Ashes series, branded as the LV= Insurance Men's Ashes Series for sponsorship reasons, was a series of Test cricket matches played between England and Australia for the Ashes in June and July 2023. The five-match series was a part of the 2023–2025 ICC World Test Championship, the venues being Edgbaston, Lord's, Headingley, Old Trafford and The Oval.\nThe result was a 2–2 draw, with Australia retaining the Ashes (having won in 2021–22).\nThe 2023 series was the 73rd Ashes series and the 37th to take place in England. Uniquely for a series hosted by England, there were no Tests in August, the dates having been brought forward to avoid a clash with The Hundred tournament. It was also the first time in which Australia played no matches against English county teams, although they did face India in the 2023 ICC World Test Championship final a week before the start of the series.\nThe series was closely and, at times, acrimoniously contested at a time when the continued relevance of Test cricket was being called into question in comparison with shorter forms of the game. The ability of the England team to recover following two narrow defeats has been ascribed to their introduction of the aggressive Bazball style of play. Australian players Usman Khawaja and Mitchell Starc topped the batting and bowling charts with totals of 496 runs and 23 wickets respectively.\nSquads.\nEngland announced their squad on 3 June 2023, whilst Australia announced theirs on 18 April 2023. Jimmy Peirson was added to the Australia squad as cover for Josh Inglis. On 4 June 2023, Jack Leach was ruled out of the series with back stress fracture; Moeen Ali was named as his replacement. On 23 June 2023, Rehan Ahmed was added to England's squad as a cover for Moeen Ali who suffered blisters in his spinning finger during the first Test. On 3 July 2023, Australia's Nathan Lyon was ruled out of the last three Tests due to an injury, with Michael Neser added to the squad. On the same day, Australia's Matt Renshaw and England's Rehan Ahmed were both released from their respective squads. On 4 July, Ollie Pope was ruled out the final three Tests due to a dislocated shoulder sustained whilst fielding in the second Test.\nMatches.\nFirst Test.\nDay one.\nAustralia entered the first Test with the decision whether to select Scott Boland ahead of either Josh Hazlewood or Mitchell Starc, after his performance against India in the World Test Championship final in the previous week. Ultimately Boland was selected ahead of the left-arm fast bowler Starc.\nEngland won the first toss of the series and elected to bat first. Australia captain Pat Cummins opened the bowling with Zak Crawley striking the very first ball of the innings for four. Ben Duckett was caught behind for 12 off Hazlewood in the fourth over. Ollie Pope then fell for 31, LBW to Nathan Lyon at the end of the 18th over. Crawley reached his half-century two balls later. However, with two balls remaining before the lunch break, Crawley was caught behind on review for 61 off Boland, meaning England entered the lunch break on the first morning 124/3.\nAfter lunch, Harry Brook (32) and captain Ben Stokes (1) were both dismissed in the space of nine balls, with Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow seeing England through to tea on 240/5. Five balls after tea, Root reverse scooped Boland for six. Bairstow (78), followed by Moeen Ali (18), were both stumped by wicketkeeper Alex Carey, before Stuart Broad (16) was bowled by all-rounder Cameron Green. Root reached his fourth Ashes century and 30th Test century overall in the 76th over. After scoring 20 runs off it, England declared at the end of the 78th over on 393/8 with Root 118* and Ollie Robinson 17*. Australia's openers were sent in to face four overs before the close of play in which they reached 14/0.\nDay two.\nDay two began five minutes later than scheduled due to the boundary rope needing to be laid out. In the 11th over Broad claimed the wicket of David Warner (9) for the 15th time in Tests, before dismissing Marnus Labuschagne the very next ball for a golden duck. Stokes then removed Steve Smith (16) in the 27th over, leaving Australia 78/3 at lunch.\nBoth Usman Khawaja and Travis Head reached half-centuries after lunch, the latter falling to Moeen Ali for exactly 50 in the 46th over. Two balls later Bairstow missed a chance to stump new batter Cameron Green. Australia reached tea without losing any further wickets on 188/4. In the evening session, Moeen Ali bowled Green for 38 in the 68th over, before Khawaja cut Stokes for four to bring up his 15th Test century and first in England in the next over. In the 81st over and having taken the new ball, Stuart Broad bowled Khawaja but the umpire deemed that Broad overstepped, resulting in a no-ball and therefore no wicket. Australia closed on 311/5, 82 runs behind England.\nDay three.\nIn the morning session, James Anderson bowled Carey for 66, before Ollie Robinson finally dismissed Khawaja for 141. This wicket resulted in Robinson giving Khawaja a \"send off\", being accused of verbally abusing the Australian batsman after taking his wicket. England went on to claim the remaining wickets before the lunch break, leaving Australia 386 all out and a first innings deficit of 7 runs.\nBeginning their second innings and looking to extend their slender lead, England reached 26/0 in 6.5 overs before rain stopped play. Play resumed 105 minutes later, with tea pushed back from its scheduled time by 80 minutes. The rain returned 20 minutes later, however, to stop play once again, although in that time both of England's openers, Duckett and Crawley, fell in the space of four deliveries to Cummins and Boland, respectively. Tea was taken, but the remainder of the day's play was called off.\nDay four.\nEngland resumed their innings on 28/2, but Cummins bowled Pope (14) in the 17th over. As Harry Brook took the attack to Australia, Root (46) was stumped by Carey off Lyon four runs short of a half-century in the 26th over. Brook fell for the same number of runs as Root, again off the bowling of spinner Lyon, in the 34th over. In the last over before lunch, Bairstow was given out LBW by umpire Erasmus but the decision was overturned on review with the ball going on to miss leg stump. England reached lunch on 155/5, a lead of 162 runs.\nAfter lunch, Bairstow (20) fell LBW to Lyon, before Stokes (43) also fell LBW this time to Cummins three overs later, with Stokes failing to overturn on review. England lost their eighth wicket in the 55th over, Ali (19) gloving to Carey off Hazlewood. Lyon then got Robinson for 27 and James Anderson, in at 10, reverse-swept Lyon for four the very next ball. Anderson was the last wicket to fall, Cummins taking his wicket, but not before adding 12 runs, leaving England 273 all out and setting Australia a target of 281 runs to win the first Test.\nAustralia started their chase with two consecutive fours from Khawaja inside the first over. Warner (36) was the first wicket to fall, in the 18th over, caught behind off Robinson. Labuschagne fell four overs later for 13, capping a poor Test by his standards. A further four overs later and Smith was caught behind off Broad for just 6, bringing Scott Boland to the crease as nightwatchman. Boland and Khawaja survived until close with Australia on 107/3, still requiring 174 runs to win with three sessions of cricket still to play.\nDay five.\nThe final day did not begin until 2:15pm due to the weather. Australia lost their fourth wicket in the eighth over of the day, Boland (20) caught behind off Broad. Ali then got Head caught by Root in the 45th over, leaving Australia 138 runs behind with five wickets remaining. Khawaja then reached another half-century, before taking Australia to tea on 183/5 with Cameron Green, requiring 98 runs.\nAfter tea, Robinson bowled Green for 28, before Stokes dismissed Khawaja for 65, bringing Cummins at 9 to the crease. England chose not to take the new ball when it became available and got their reward, taking Australia's eighth wicket, Carey caught and bowled by Root. Australia at this point still required 54 runs with just two wickets remaining. Despite taking the new ball, England could not take the remaining two wickets required and Cummins and number 10 batter Lyon chased down the remaining runs to win by two wickets.\nSecond Test.\nDay one.\nAustralia went into the second Test making one change to their line-up with Mitchell Starc returning in place of Scott Boland. England also made one change, bringing in pace bowler Josh Tongue for only his second Test and Ashes debut, to replace Moeen Ali, who suffered a finger injury in the previous Test. England won a second consecutive toss and opted to bowl first. Australia began the morning session well and, after a very brief rain delay, David Warner brought up a half-century with a six in the 22nd over. Two overs later, Tongue bowled Usman Khawaja for 17 to pick up his first Ashes wicket. This wicket also brought the lunch break with Australia 73/1.\nAfter lunch, rain stopped play but once again the delay was short lived and soon after Tongue picked up a second wicket, this time bowling Warner for 66. Steve Smith was given out caught behind off Stuart Broad but the decision was overturned on review with replays showing a clear gap between bat and ball. Marnus Labuschagne was also given out off Broad, this time for LBW, but again the decision was overturned on review with ball tracking suggesting the ball would go on to miss the stumps. Smith then reached 9,000 Test runs, the second-fastest to reach that milestone after Kumar Sangakkara. Australia reached tea on 190/2.\nAfter tea, Ollie Robinson got Labuschagne caught behind for 47 and Smith brought up his half-century in the 61st over, which was soon followed by Travis Head's 50 off 48 balls. Head was later stumped by Jonny Bairstow off Joe Root for 77, and new batter Cameron Green fell to Root three balls later for a duck. England took the new ball with two overs remaining before stumps, but Australia held out to reach 339/5 at the close.\nDay two.\nIn the second over of the morning, Alex Carey fell LBW to Broad for 22, with the original not out decision being overturned on review. Starc was out three overs later, caught behind off James Anderson for 6. Smith then brought up his 32nd Test century with a cover drive for four in the 92nd over. He was finally out for 110 four overs later, falling to Tongue for his third wicket of the innings. Robinson then got Nathan Lyon for 7 in the 99th over, before taking the final wicket of Josh Hazlewood (4) to bowl Australia out for 416. England survived four overs in their reply before lunch, going in 13/0.\nAlmost immediately after drinks midway through the afternoon session, Carey's fourth stumping of the series thus far off Lyon dismissed Crawley two runs shy of a half-century. Ben Duckett reached his half-century in the 29th over and the next over brought up a fifty partnership with Ollie Pope, with England reaching tea on 145/1.\nAfter tea, Lyon suffered a calf injury in the field which would ultimately rule him out for the remainder of the series. Australia then reverted to short-pitched bowling to great reward. Firstly, Pope, also nursing an injury, fell to Green for 42. Three balls later, Root gloved a catch to Carey off Green but was given as a no-ball. Soon after, Duckett fell two runs short of a second century in the series, top edging a catch to Warner off Hazlewood. Root then fell to a highly disputed catch from Steve Smith, with the decision ultimately being given out by third umpire Marais Erasmus. No further wickets fell before close, with England on 278/4, 138 runs behind.\nDay three.\nSecond ball of the morning session had Ben Stokes falling to Starc for 17. Harry Brook went on to reach a half-century, before splicing a short ball to Pat Cummins off Starc in the very next over. Bairstow was next to fall, giving Cummins another catch, this time off Hazlewood for 16 in the 73rd over. Three overs later and England lost two quick wickets, Robinson (9) and Broad (12) falling in the space of five balls to the spin of Head. Just three balls later and last man Anderson was out to Cummins for 1, England all out for 325 giving Australia a 91-run lead. Warner and Khawaja successfully negotiated a potentially tricky six-over spell up to lunch, with Australia on 12/0.\nAfter lunch, Australia continued to extend their lead without loss up until the drinks break, after which Tongue trapped Warner LBW for 25, the Australian batter failing to overturn the out decision on review. Labuschagne was given out LBW to Tongue two overs later but successfully overturned the decision with ball tracking having the impact hitting outside the line of off stump. Khawaja and Labuschagne took Australia to 81/1 at tea, a lead of 172, despite the latter surviving two huge LBW appeals in the over before tea.\nIn the evening session, Khawaja continued his good form by bringing up another half-century. Labuschagne survived yet another LBW appeal, which had England reviewed, would have been overturned and given out. He did finally fall in the 41st over, caught at backward point off Anderson for 30. Umpires took the players off at 5:10pm due to rain and play was abandoned for the day at 5:45pm, leaving Australia 130/2 at the close with a lead of 221.\nDay four.\nDay four began five minutes later than scheduled due to a brief rain shower before play. Smith struck the first ball of the morning for four. Khawaja and Smith took Australia beyond the drinks break unscathed but the former fell immediately afterwards, caught at fine leg off Broad for 77. In the next over, Anderson dropped a straightforward catch from new batter Head, before Tongue got Smith the next ball for 34. Five overs later and Head fell to Broad for 7. Carey and Green saw Australia to the slightly later lunch break on 222/5, leading by 313 runs.\nRobinson managed to take the wickets of Green (18) and Carey (21) midway through the afternoon session, and Stokes had Cummins caught at point off a no-ball. Three overs later however Cummins did fall, caught at gully for 11 off Broad. Stokes got Hazlewood in the next over for just 1, leaving the injured Lyon hobbling out to the middle to join Starc. Lyon batted admirably, including hitting a four, but was caught at midwicket in the same over by Stokes off Broad, ending Australia's second innings at 279 and giving England a target of 371 to win the second Test.\nEngland's chase began after the tea break, with Crawley falling to Starc for 3 in the third over. Two balls later and Duckett successfully overturned an LBW decision. In the fifth over, Starc struck again, this time bowling Pope for 3. Root and Duckett steadied the innings until the 13th over, in which Cummins got both Root (18), caught at slip and new batter Brook (4), who was bowled, in the space of four deliveries leaving England 46/4. Duckett and Stokes launched a counter-attack, with the former bringing up a half-century off 62 balls in the 28th over. The next over came the first of two moments of debate and controversy in this match, with third umpire Erasmus deeming Starc to have put down a catch in the deep off Duckett by grounding the ball on the floor before being in control of his body. England reached the close at 7:10pm on 114/4, still requiring 257 runs to win.\nDay five.\nThe morning session began with Duckett and Stokes playing positively, the latter successfully overturning an LBW decision given against him, and bringing up a half-century in the 41st over. In the first over after drinks, Hazlewood took the wicket of Duckett for 83, again falling short of a century. Then followed the second of the two moments of debate and controversy in the match. At the end of the 52nd over, Bairstow ducked a Cameron Green bouncer and walked out of his crease prematurely, prior to \"over\" being called. Wicketkeeper Carey threw down the stumps with Australia celebrating, the decision again being sent to third umpire Erasmus who decided that the ball was live at the moment the bails were dislodged and therefore Bairstow was deemed out stumped. Laws of Cricket 20.1.2 and 20.2 place the onus on the umpire to decide when the ball is considered dead by both sides or finally settled in the hands of the wicketkeeper. After this moment, Stokes upped his counter-attack and struck three consecutive sixes to bring up a 13th Test and fourth Ashes hundred, before also bringing up a 50-run stand with Broad on the stroke of lunch. This left England on 243/6, still requiring 128 runs to win.\nThe lunch break saw unsavoury scenes in the Lord's Long Room, with three MCC members suspended for their part in an incident with various Australia players for \"abusive, offensive or inappropriate behaviour or language\" with one of those members suspended for life. After lunch, Broad and Stokes continued to build their partnership and the latter resumed his explosive innings, bringing up his 150 in the 69th over before eventually falling to Hazlewood for 155. Stokes' innings contained nine fours and nine sixes. England still required 70 runs at the point of Stokes' departure. Robinson (1) fell in the next over to Cummins and Broad (11) the over after to Hazlewood. England's last wicket partnership survived for seven overs and took them within 44 runs of their target before Starc bowled Tongue to secure a 43-run victory for Australia and to go 2–0 up in the series.\nThird Test.\nDay one.\nFacing a 2–0 deficit in a home series for the first time since 2001, England made three changes to their team, with one being enforced. Ollie Pope dropped out having been ruled out of the series entirely and Moeen Ali came back into the side following his finger injury. Both James Anderson and Josh Tongue were rested, the latter after only featuring in the previous Test, bringing in bowlers Mark Wood and Chris Woakes for their first appearances of the series.\nAustralia also made three changes, two enforced due to injuries to Nathan Lyon and Cameron Green in the previous Test. Spinner Todd Murphy and all-rounder Mitchell Marsh were their respective direct replacements, whilst Josh Hazlewood dropped out for the returning Scott Boland.\nEngland won a third consecutive toss and opted to bowl first. David Warner drove the first ball of the morning off Broad for four, but fell to him four balls later for the 16th time in Tests. Ollie Robinson opened the bowling with Broad, with Mark Wood coming into the attack in the seventh over. Wood produced speeds of up to 95 mph during his spell, in which he bowled Usman Khawaja for 13. Marnus Labuschagne fell to Woakes for 21 in the 20th over, and Broad dismissed Steve Smith five overs later, caught behind for 22. Australia entered lunch on 91/4.\nDuring the afternoon session, Marsh brought up a 102-ball century, whilst Robinson left the field mid-over after suffering a back spasm. On the stroke of tea, Woakes finally had Marsh caught at slip for 118 leaving Australia 240/5. After tea, Head fell for 39, again Woakes with the wicket, Joe Root taking the catch after dropping Alex Carey the previous delivery. Two overs later and Wood returned to dismiss Mitchell Starc (2) and Pat Cummins (0) in the space of three deliveries. Wood got his fourth wicket two overs later, dismissing Carey for 8. Wood then completed his five wicket haul by taking the last wicket of Murphy for 13 to end Australia's innings on 263, completing a collapse of 6–23 in just 8.2 overs. Duckett fell for 2 to Cummins early in England's reply and two overs later had Harry Brook, batting at three instead of his usual five, caught at second slip for 3. England then lost Crawley (33) to Marsh before the close to end the day on 68/3.\nDay two.\nJoe Root was out second ball of the morning for 19, nicking off to first slip off Cummins. Starc then got Jonny Bairstow for 12. Stokes and Ali then rebuilt before the latter attempted a pull off Cummins only to be caught by Smith at fine leg for 21, having gotten away with a similar shot two balls prior. Woakes joined Ali back in the pavilion on the stroke of lunch, making a run-a-ball 10 before falling to the short ball trap once more off Starc. England went into lunch 142/7.\nImmediately after lunch, new batter Wood struck 18 runs off the first over including two sixes and a four. Wood hit another six in the next over, but was caught at midwicket soon after off Cummins after making 24 off 8 balls. Broad fell for 8 four overs later again off Cummins, whilst Stokes attacked the Australian bowling at the other end. Stokes continued his assault for the last wicket stand, hitting a further five sixes while bringing up his half-century, before finally falling for 80 to the spin of Murphy, leaving England all out for 237 and a first innings deficit of 26.\nIn the third over of Australia's second batting innings, Broad dismissed Warner (1) for the second time in the Test and 17th time in all Tests as Australia reached tea on 29/1, a lead of 55. After tea, Moeen Ali quickly picked up the wickets of the two danger men, Labuschagne (33) and Smith (2), the latter his 200th wicket in Tests. After the drinks break, Woakes dismissed Khawaja caught behind for 43 as Head and Marsh put together a partnership to see Australia to close on 116/4, leading by 142.\nDay three.\nPlay on day three was delayed until the evening session due to the weather, with only one over being bowled before play was interrupted once more. The delay only lasted 20 minutes however, and Woakes managed to remove both Marsh (28) and Carey (5) after the resumption. Wood came on to take the wickets of Starc (16) and Cummins (1), after which Head took the attack to England, bringing up his half-century with a boundary. Murphy fell LBW to Broad for 11, after which Head struck consecutive sixes to extend Australia's lead, before falling to Broad for 77. Australia ended up all out for 224, setting England a target of 251 to win. England's chase began after 7pm, with Australia going wicketless in the five overs until close with England on 27/0.\nDay four.\nEngland lost their first wicket five overs into the morning as Duckett fell LBW to Starc for 23. Surprisingly, Moeen Ali came out to bat at three after the Brook experiment failed in the first innings. This too also failed as Ali was bowled by Starc for just 5. Root came in to establish a partnership with Crawley, but it was the opener who fell next for 44 as he was caught behind off Marsh to leave England 93/3. Brook, in at his usual spot of five, played himself in before upping his scoring with boundaries off Boland and Starc. Root gloved an attempted pull down the leg side to Carey off Cummins for 21, with next batter Stokes clipping his first delivery for four. Brook and Stokes saw England through to lunch on 153/4, with the target now down to double figures on 98 required.\nStokes fell second over after lunch, a similar dismissal to Root as he edged down the leg side to Carey off Starc for 13. Bairstow came and went two overs later, bowled by Starc for 5. Woakes joined Brook at the crease, with Brook bringing up a crucial half-century off 67 balls. Brook was dismissed after drinks however, top edging a catch to Cummins off Starc for 75, with the bowler and fielder nearly colliding going for the catch. With the last recognised batsman gone, England still required 21. Wood joined his bowling partner Woakes in the middle, and repeating his first innings approach, struck an 8-ball 16 whilst Woakes hit the winning runs with a drive through point to the boundary to finish 32* and secure a 3-wicket victory for England, pulling one back in the series at 2–1 heading to Old Trafford.\nFourth Test.\nDay one.\nEngland made one change to their starting XI with James Anderson, on his home ground, replacing Ollie Robinson. Australia dropped their frontline spinner Todd Murphy for the returning Josh Hazlewood, whilst Cameron Green returned in place of seamer Scott Boland, leaving only part-time spinners in their bowling attack. England won a fourth consecutive toss and elected to bowl, and David Warner hit the first ball of the match for four. Usman Khawaja was the first batter to fall, LBW to Broad for 3 in the fifth over. Almost immediately after the drinks break, Woakes had Warner caught behind for 32. A partnership of 46 from Steve Smith and Marnus Labuschagne saw Australia through to lunch on 107/2.\nFive overs after lunch, Wood got Smith out LBW for 41, the initial not out decision by umpire Menon being reviewed by England and overturned by DRS. Labuschagne brought up a half-century in the 46th over but was out in the next over for 51, trapped LBW by Moeen Ali and like Smith before him, was given not out on-field but overturned by DRS on review. Australia reached tea on 187/4.\nFive balls after tea, Stuart Broad picked up his 600th Test wicket, seeing Travis Head caught by Joe Root two runs shy of a half-century. Broad became only the fifth man to reach 600 wickets in Tests. Mitchell Marsh and Cameron Green brought up a fifty partnership in the 60th over, with Marsh himself reaching 50 from 56 balls two overs later. In the next over, Woakes dismissed both Green, LBW for 16, and Marsh four balls later, sensationally caught by Jonny Bairstow behind the stumps for 51. Alex Carey and Mitchell Starc struck up a 29-run partnership before England took the new ball when it was available and with it Woakes immediately dismissed Carey, caught behind for 20. Australia ended the day 299/8.\nDay two.\nPat Cummins fell for 1 to the first ball of the morning, James Anderson picking up his first wicket of the match. The next over, Woakes had Hazlewood caught at slip but had overstepped for a no-ball. Woakes did get Hazlewood a few overs later, caught at third slip by Ben Duckett for 4, securing his first Ashes five-wicket haul. Australia's innings finished on 317 all out. Zak Crawley, like Warner before him, and like he did off the first ball of the entire series, struck the first ball of the innings for four. Duckett was caught behind off Starc for 1 in the third over, bringing Moeen Ali to the crease at 3. Ali reached 3,000 Test runs in the 14th over with a boundary off Cummins, and along with Crawley saw England through to lunch on 61/1.\nAfter lunch, England upped their scoring rate and took the attack to the bowlers. Crawley reached his half-century in the 23rd over with a four, followed immediately by a six to bring up England's 100. Crawley then reached the milestone of 2,000 Test runs, and this was soon followed by Ali's half-century off 74 balls, his first 50 since 2019. However three overs later Ali holed out to Khawaja for 54 off Starc. Root got off the mark immediately with a pull for four. Crawley and Root continued their attack and Crawley reached his century off just 93 balls in the 33rd over, and the two batters took England to tea on 239/2 with the afternoon session bringing 178 runs from 25 overs, a run rate of 7.12.\nRoot brought up his own half-century from 45 balls after tea with a reverse ramp shot off Cummins, which was soon followed by Crawley reaching 150. Crawley finally departed for 189 off 182 balls in the 57th over, bowled by Green. Five overs later Root fell for 84, a Hazlewood delivery keeping very low and bowling the former England captain. Ben Stokes and Harry Brook saw England to stumps on 384/4 with a lead of 67.\nDay three.\nIn the second over of the morning, Carey missed an opportunity to run out Stokes, dropping the ball before breaking the bails with his gloves. Stokes went on to reach his half-century in the 82nd over, but two overs later Cummins had him bowled for 51 off 74 balls. Brook brought up a half-century of his own, his second consecutive 50, in the 86th over. Australia took the new ball in the 91st over, 11 overs after it became available. They were rewarded an over later as Hazlewood had Brook caught at deep backward square for 61. This brought Woakes to the crease but he fell for a golden duck, England's first duck of the series, an over later to Hazlewood. Wood, in at number 9, was out for 6 on the stroke of lunch, bowled by Hazlewood for his fourth wicket. This left England on 506/8, by far their biggest score of the series so far, and a lead of 189 runs.\nThe afternoon session lasted just 3 deliveries before rain took the players off, but soon cleared and play was back under way inside 13 minutes. Hazlewood completed his five-for with the dismissal of Broad for 7, taking a catch off his own bowling. Last batter Anderson joined Bairstow in the middle, and Bairstow took the attack to Australia, bringing up a half-century with a six. Bairstow continued to dominate Australia's bowling with fours and sixes, before being left stranded on 99* after Anderson was trapped LBW by Green for 5. Bairstow became the seventh man in Tests to be left on 99* and only the second in Ashes cricket behind Steve Waugh. England's extraordinary innings ended on 592 all out, a first innings lead of 275 runs. Scoring at 5.49 runs per over, it was the third fastest batting innings to reach 500 runs, behind two of England's innings against Pakistan and Ireland both occurring within the past eight months. It was also the first time since the fifth Test of the 1985 Ashes that England have reached 500 in a home series.\nAustralia lost the first wicket of their second innings in the 11th over, Wood finding the edge of Khawaja's bat; after an unsuccessful review of the on-field 'out' decision, Khawaja departed for 18. Australia reached a slightly delayed tea on 39/1 from 12 overs, still 236 runs behind. Warner was first to fall after tea, bowled by Woakes for 28. Labuschagne and Smith built up a partnership of 43, before Wood took his 100th Test wicket by removing Smith caught behind for 17. Four overs later it was Wood again who took the next wicket, Duckett catching Head in the gully for 1. Marsh and Labuschagne saw Australia to a delayed close at 6:43pm on 113/4, trailing by 162 runs but with the following day's play under threat of being severely affected by the weather.\nDay four.\nAs expected, no play was possible in the morning session due to poor weather, but with the rain easing early in the afternoon, play was scheduled to start at 2:45pm after an earlier pitch inspection. Labuschagne and Marsh continued, with the former reaching his second half-century of the match early on, before converting it into a first century of the series. Halfway through the session, the umpires deemed the light not enough to be able to safely bowl pace and so England were required to bring Ali and Root into the attack. After reaching his 100 off the dual spin attack, Labuschagne was caught behind off Root for 111, after England reviewed the initial on-field not out decision which was overturned. England reviewed a further not out decision with the last ball before tea but the original decision was upheld. Australia entered a delayed tea at 5:00pm on 214/5, trailing by 61 runs. During the tea break, the rain returned and prevented any play whatsoever during the evening session with stumps being called at 6:26pm with no hope of resuming play before the 7pm cut off.\nDay five.\nWith morning rain clearing there was hope for a delayed start to play. An early lunch break was taken at 12:20pm with play scheduled to commence at 1pm, however rain during the lunch break prevented this. The rain became torrential at times throughout the afternoon preventing any play and soon after 5.20pm the umpires decided to officially abandon play for the day without a ball being bowled. The match was therefore declared a draw and as a result Australia retained the Ashes.\nFifth Test.\nDay one.\nEngland named an unchanged team from the previous Test, whilst Australia brought in spinner Todd Murphy, who was dropped for the Old Trafford Test, to replace Cameron Green. Pat Cummins won his first toss of the series and opted to bowl first in overcast conditions.\nEngland's openers started positively, raising a fifty partnership after 10 overs, with Ben Duckett making a run-a-ball 41 before he gloved one behind off Mitchell Marsh. This wicket was the first of three to go down for just 11 runs with Zak Crawley (22) and Joe Root (5) being dismissed by Pat Cummins and Josh Hazlewood, respectively. Harry Brook and Moeen Ali put together a fifty partnership of their own to steer the innings to lunch with England on 131/3.\nAfter lunch, Brook brought up his fourth half-century of the series off just 44 balls. Moeen hit two sixes before missing one from Murphy to be bowled for 34. England captain Ben Stokes came and went, falling for just 3 off 16, again bowled, this time by Mitchell Starc. Jonny Bairstow was also bowled, scoring 4 off 14, by Hazlewood. Three balls later, Brook finally fell for 85, edging to Steve Smith off Starc. Chris Woakes and Mark Wood saw England to tea, bringing up England's 250 with the last ball before, on 250/7.\nAlmost immediately after resumption, Woakes was given out LBW but reviewed the decision, getting it overturned after DRS found an edge off the bat. Two balls later, Woakes was dropped at gully by Marsh, one of five dropped catches throughout the day by Australia. The following over, spinner Murphy dismissed Wood for 28. Another over later and Stuart Broad also returned to the pavilion, caught for 7 at cover by Travis Head off Starc. After hitting a six and then a four, Woakes became the last batter to fall, caught at fine leg for Starc's fourth wicket, making a run-a-ball 36. England's innings came to an end all out for 283.\nIn Australia's reply, Broad had an appeal for LBW against Usman Khawaja turned down off the very first ball. As usual, Broad and James Anderson opened the bowling for England, but it was Woakes who made the breakthrough in the 17th over, David Warner caught in the cordon by Crawley for 24. Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne saw Australia through to stumps, unbeaten on 26 and 2, respectively, at 61/1.\nDay two.\nAustralia began the morning at a slow rate, scoring just 21 runs in the first hour of the session up to the drinks break. Four overs after drinks, Wood had Labuschagne caught brilliantly at first slip by Root for 9 off 82 balls, a strike rate of 10.97. It was the only wicket to fall in the morning as Australia reached lunch on 115/2.\nThe afternoon session heralded much more action as Australia lost five further wickets before tea. Five balls after lunch, Broad trapped Khawaja LBW three runs short of a half-century. Two overs later and new batter Head had to depart for 4, caught behind again off Broad. In the 61st over, Anderson took his first wicket of the match with Mitchell Marsh chopping onto his stumps for 16. Wicketkeeper Carey was dismissed for 10 by Root, one ball after slog-sweeping him for six, with Stokes taking his 100th Test catch. Starc was the final wicket to fall in the eventful session before tea, attempting a pull shot off Wood but top-edging to Duckett for 7. Australia were 186/7 at tea, still 97 runs behind.\nThree overs into the evening session, England thought they had Smith run out. Attempting to run two, substitute fielder George Ealham got his throw into Bairstow before Smith could make his ground. However, closer inspection by the third umpire revealed that Bairstow had dislodged one side of the bails from its groove before the ball had settled in his gloves, meaning that Smith had actually made his ground before Bairstow completed the full dislodgement of the bail. Australia survived another close call later as Cummins was given out LBW off Broad but reviewed successfully after DRS had the ball sliding down the leg side and missing the stumps. Cummins and Smith put together a crucial fifty partnership for Australia before Smith top-edged to Bairstow off Woakes for 71 on the stroke of the drinks break. Number 10 batter Murphy came in and counter-punched, hitting two fours and three sixes on his way to making 34 off 39 before Woakes trapped him LBW. Cummins was the last to fall in the last over of the day, caught on the boundary by Stokes for 36. Australia's innings ended on 295, a first innings lead of 12.\nDay three.\nCrawley again struck the first ball of the innings for four, with Duckett also hitting the final two balls of the first over for four, putting England into the lead off the first six deliveries of the innings. The two openers put on a fifty partnership in just 8.4 overs. Starc prized the wicket of Duckett for 42 to break the opening partnership in the 17th over. Originally given not out by the on-field umpire, Australia reviewed and DRS revealed an edge. Four overs later, Crawley brought up another half-century off 61 balls. England's aggressive batting took them to lunch on 130/1 off 25 overs, a run rate of 5.20.\nCrawley nicked to slip off Cummins for 73 in the second over after lunch, after which Stokes and Root continued to build a lead for England, bringing up their fifty partnership on the stroke of the drinks break. After drinks, Root brought up his half-century, followed by Stokes holing out to mid-on for 42 off spinner Murphy. New batter Brook fell an over later, after hitting a six, caught behind for 7 off Hazlewood. Root and Bairstow saw England reach tea on 265/4, a lead of 253.\nThree overs into the evening session, Root and Bairstow brought up yet another fifty partnership in England's batting innings. Later Bairstow brought up his own half-century with a cover drive off Hazlewood. The two batters took England's lead beyond 300, before the partnership was finally broken with a delivery from Murphy that kept very low and caught Root's inside edge, bowling him for 91. Starc then got Bairstow caught behind for 78, and two overs later Woakes followed suit by driving straight to mid-off for 1 off Starc once more. England lost their eighth and ninth wickets in the space of three deliveries, Ali (29) attempting to ramp Starc but only holing out to Hazlewood at fine leg, and Wood (9) slogging straight to Marsh at deep midwicket off Murphy. Anderson and Broad saw England to stumps on 389/9, leading by 377 runs.\nIn a post-match interview almost immediately after the close of play, England bowler Stuart Broad announced his retirement from all cricket upon the completion of this Test.\nDay four.\nWith Broad having announced his retirement from cricket after this match, Australia welcomed Broad to the field with a guard of honour. Resuming on 389/9, England only lasted 11 balls with the addition of six runs, those runs being a six off the bat of Broad with his last ever delivery faced in Test cricket. Anderson the batter out for 8, trapped LBW by Murphy. England finished on 395, setting Australia a target of 384 runs to win the Test. Australia's openers eased into their chase, bringing up their fifty partnership inside 14 overs. Australia reached lunch without losing a wicket on 75/0, still requiring 309 runs.\nAfter lunch, Khawaja and Warner brought up their first century partnership of the series in the 33rd over, and Khawaja brought up his own half-century the very next ball with an edge between slip and gully. Two overs later Warner reached his half-century with a pull to square leg for two. In the 37th over, a Wood bouncer hit Khawaja on the helmet and the ball was replaced with what was described as \"an old, reverse (swinging) ball to a brand-new ball\" from the box of replacement balls for the match. During the drinks break at 2:40pm, rain stopped play and set in for the rest of day, with play being abandoned at 4:47pm with Australia on 135/0, 249 away from their target of 384.\nDay five.\nPlay on the final day of the series was delayed by 10 minutes due to a brief rain shower. Woakes made an early breakthrough for England, having Warner caught behind for 60 in fourth over of the morning. Just two overs later and Woakes prised the second opener out, trapping Khawaja LBW for 72. Labuschagne edged Wood to second slip for 13 at the end of the 49th over, before Smith and Head rebuilt the Australian innings, bringing up 200 and a fifty partnership. On the stroke of a delayed lunch break, England thought they had Smith out. Appealing for a catch by Stokes off Ali and given not out, England reviewed the decision which revealed the ball brushed Smith's gloves on the way through, but that Stokes had dropped the ball before completing the catch. The on-field decision was therefore upheld. Australia took lunch at 1:30pm on 238/3, requiring 146 runs to seal the series.\nThe afternoon session was moments away from resuming, with the players out in the middle and ready to start, before rain prevented a ball from being bowled. The afternoon session was washed out and an early tea was taken at 3:20pm to ensure maximum play in the evening session.\nThe evening and final session of the series resumed at 4:20pm after an earlier inspection, with Head and Smith continuing their partnership for a further seven overs. In the eighth over of the session, Ali had Head edging to Root at slip for 43. Smith (54) followed in the next over, again edging to slip, this time off Woakes, after making his half-century in the previous over. One over later and Ali picked up another wicket, this time inducing an inside edge off Marsh, acrobatically caught behind by Bairstow for just 6. An Australian batting collapse of four wickets for 11 runs was complete in the following over as Woakes dismissed Starc second ball for 0, his fourth and final wicket of the innings. Cummins and Carey briefly stemmed the loss of wickets, and brought the target to below 100. However, Cummins attempted to pull Ali but deflected onto his pad and looped up a catch for Stokes at leg slip, falling for 9, leaving Australia requiring 90 runs and England two wickets, to win the Test. Carey continued to anchor the innings along with Murphy, both batters hitting boundaries to reduce the target to 55, before Murphy edged to Bairstow off Broad for 18. Broad then took the final wicket of Carey, with his final delivery in Test cricket, again caught behind for 28, to bowl Australia out for 334, secure a 49-run win and a 2–2 series draw."

The format was the same as the Premiership competition used for First Division clubs, with the teams finishing in the top eight in the league competing in an end-of-season knockout tournament. The final was staged at Old Trafford as a curtain raiser for the First Division Premiership final, with the man of the match being awarded the Tom Bergin Trophy.\nWhen a Third Division was introduced in the 1991–92 season, the competition was renamed the Divisional Premiership, and was expanded to include both Second and Third Division teams. The competition returned to the previous format when the league reverted to two divisions in the 1993–94 season.\nFollowing the switch to summer rugby, a shortened four-team format was used for the 1996 competition. In 1998, the competition was replaced by a play-off system which would determine promotion to the Super League.

        "title": "2003–04 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2003–04 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season was the 55th season of play for the program and 45th in the WCHA. The Pioneers represented the University of Denver in the 2003–04 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at Magness Arena and were coached by George Gwozdecky, in his 10th season. The team won the 2004 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, the 6th title in program history.\nSeason.\nEntering the season, Denver was in a bit of a slump. The Pioneers were seven years removed from their last NCAA tournament win and had made just 1 appearance in the Frozen Four since 1972. While the team was ranked entering the season, Denver was outside the top-10 and not one of the favorites to challenge for the championship. The Pioneers started well, winning their first six games of the year, but they stumbled a bit once they began their conference schedule. Splits against schools like Minnesota and Colorado College didn't harm their standing, however, getting badly beaten twice by North Dakota at home didn't engender much faith from the voters. The Pioneers played up and down though the first half of their season but did settle on a few facts; Adam Berkhoel was their starting goalie and without him they didn't have much of a chance.\nAs the season progressed, it became apparent that while Denver could score goals, they did not have the high-end offense that some of their contemporaries did. None of the players reached 20 goals on the year and only Gabe Gauthier managed to average a point per game. On the back end, their defense was no juggernaut either; while allowing 27 shots against per game wasn't bad, it was hardly world-beating. Berkhoel was key for the team's chances and while he turned in several sterling performances, the senior netminder would go through bad stretches during the season. Denver also had a slight disadvantage of playing in the WCHA, which was typically regarded as the best conference in college hockey. When they hit the winter break, Denver had a solid record overall but were under .500 in conference play. After resuming their season in January, Denver won 4 games in a row but then followed that up with a 1–4–1 stretch against WCHA teams. With their ranking having dropped to #12, the Pioneers were in danger of missing out on the NCAA Tournament and needed to arrest their slide.\nAfter a week off at the beginning of February, the Pioneers appeared to steady themselves and didn't drop another game for the remainder of the regular season. The team went 7–0–1 over the final four weeks and put themselves into the top-5. With their postseason position essentially guaranteed, Denver began the conference tournament against long-time rival Colorado College at home. After a lackluster loss in the first game, Denver's defense collapsed and allowed 6 goals to the Tigers. The poor performance knocked the Pioneers out and dropped their ranking by several spots. While the team would still make the national tournament, the losses meant that they would have to open against a stronger opponent in the first game.\nNCAA Tournament.\nDenver's final ranking by the selection committee was 8th, good enough for the final 2-seed and a spot in the Western Regional final, located in Colorado Springs. Behind a partisan crowd, the Pioneers took on Miami and got off to a good start. team captain Ryan Caldwell opened the scoring with a short-handed marker in the first and then played a strong defensive game to hold off the RedHawks. The two traded goals in the final two periods but Miami was never able to tie the game and Denver skated away with a narrow victory.\nFor their second match of the tournament, Denver had to go through the #1 overall seed, North Dakota. The Fighting Sioux had easily taken the season series and were looking to put the Pioneers down with another embarrassing loss but Berkhoel would have none of it. While Denver was outshot 17–33 in the game, not a single one went into the Pioneer cage. Denver's offense was anemic all game and the scoresheet sat empty for over 57 minutes. Just when it appeared that overtime was inevitable, junior Luke Fulghum deflected a shot from Max Bull into the net. North Dakota desperately tried to even the score but the horn sounded before they would score and Denver was off to Boston.\nIn the national semifinal, things couldn't have started worse for the Pioneers. Minnesota–Duluth scored twice in the first five minutes of the game and, after Denver gave Duluth four additional power play opportunities, it appeared that the Bulldogs were going to roll over the Pioneers. Somehow, Berkhoel and the defense held and prevented UMD's lead from increasing. A more even second period gave Denver the chance they needed and Fulghum cut the lead in half near the mid-point of the game. Unfortunately, a 6th power play opportunity for Minnesota–Duluth saw them regain their 2-goal edge and Denver needed a mammoth effort in the final frame if they wanted their season to continue. The Pioneers came out swinging in the third and Connor James scored in the third minute. Just 34 seconds later, Caldwell added a marker and suddenly Denver was in a tie game. Duluth called a timeout to settle their players down but Denver had all the momentum and they continued to press the attack. Lukas Dora, who had taken the penalty that had led to UMD's third goal, redeemed himself by giving Denver its first lead of the game. The defense then turned in a masterful performance to limit the Bulldogs' scoring opportunities and the Pioneers bled the clock for the final 11 minutes. An empty-net goal sealed the deal and put Denver in the championship match for the first time in 35 years.\nIn the final game of the year, Maine was all that stood between Denver and the program's 6th title. While the Black Bears had a good offense, they had produced one of the top defensive seasons in the history of college hockey. The opposition was led by goaltender Jimmy Howard, who had set numerous NCAA records that season, including save percentage and goals against average. Playing as the underdog, Denver got off to a slow start and allowed Maine to open the scoring on their first power play of the game. The Pioneers were then beneficiaries of a very controversial ruling by the officials when the goal was waved off. Mike Hamilton was ruled to have committed a crease violation by having his skate be inside the protected area before the puck entered the goal crease. While he had not materially contributed to the goal, it was enough of an infraction to wave off the goal, much to the ire of the partisan audience. Seven minutes later, while on a power play of their own, James found Gauthier alone in the slot and the senior center scored the first official goal of the game. Neither team played particularly well on offense for the rest of the contest and it was typified by strong defensive play and penalties. Over the final two periods, the two teams combined for twelve minor penalties and six power play opportunities but just 34 shots. Denver was able to ride its narrow lead for most of the game and as time ticked away they grew closer and closer to the title. With just over 2 minutes left on the clock, Matt Laatsch was called for hooking and sent Maine to the power play for the 6th time that night. On one of the Black Bears' zone entries, Gabe Gauthier snagged the puck out of the air and tossed it back down the ice. The referees ruled that he had closed his hand on the puck and handed him a 2-minute penalty for delay of game. Now Denver found itself having to defend a 3-on-5 disadvantage for the final 90 seconds of the game, a situation made all the more precarious when Maine pulled their goaltender to give them twice as many skaters as the Pioneers. The final stretch of the game would go down in college hockey lore as one of the more stunning defensive efforts but neither the defense nor Berkhoel nor the post would give an inch and Maine failed to score. A missed pass to the point helped Denver run out the clock and win the national championship.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

It was arranged with the special cooperation of Toshiba with official naming rights. The draft was officially called \"The Professional Baseball Draft Meeting supported by TOSHIBA.\" It has been sponsored by Toshiba for the 3rd consecutive year since 2009.\nSummary.\nOnly the first round picks will be done by bid lottery. After the second round, waver selections were made in order from the lowest-ranked team of the 2011 season in both the Central League and Pacific League, the third round was reversed and selections were made from the top team, and the fourth round was reversed again, alternating with selections from the lowest-ranked team until all teams had finished selecting players.\nSince the season, the winner of the NPB All-Star Game has determined whether the Central League or the Pacific League gets waiver preference after the second round. In the 2011 All-Star Game, the Pacific League won two games, so the Pacific League was given waiver priority over the Central League.\nThe Yomiuri Giants publicly announced that they would pick Tomoyuki Sugano, the nephew of the Giants' manager Tatsunori Hara, in the first round, which caused other teams to shun him, and Sugano was expected to be the Giants' lone pick. However, the Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters pushed for the nomination, and as a result of a lottery bidding with the Giants, the Fighters won the right to negotiate. Sugano did not agree to negotiations with the Fighters and did not join the team. When the fighters won the lots, the audience cheered and applauded. The reason for this was the backlash from the fans after the Giants publicly announced the players they wanted to pick in the first round and used it as a way to deter other teams, picking Hisayoshi Chono in 2009 and Hirokazu Sawamura in 2010 by themselves. The Sugano pick sparked a debate about the significance of the draft system."

        "title": "2022–23 NFL playoffs",
        "text": "The National Football League playoffs for the 2022 season began on January 14, 2023, and concluded with Super Bowl LVII on February 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Philadelphia Eagles.\nThis was the first postseason under a new rule in which both teams will be assured one possession in overtime, even if the first team with possession scores a touchdown. However, no game went into overtime.\nWith Jacksonville and Kansas City facing each other in the AFC Divisional Round, Kansas City became the fourth team in NFL history (the other three being the Los Angeles Rams, Philadelphia, and Buffalo) to face every team within their respective conference in the postseason at least once.\nParticipants.\nUnused format changes following Week 17 canceled Bills–Bengals game.\nDuring the Week 17 game on January 2 between the Buffalo Bills and Cincinnati Bengals, Buffalo safety Damar Hamlin collapsed and remained motionless after making a tackle on Cincinnati wide receiver Tee Higgins. At the time of Hamlin's collapse, there was 5:58 remaining in the first quarter with Cincinnati leading 7–3. It was later revealed that he had suffered cardiac arrest and was in critical condition. The remainder of the game was then postponed for the rest of the night, and on the following day, the NFL initially said that it would not be resumed that week. Then on January 5, the league announced that the game would be canceled entirely, and both teams would finish the regular season with only 16 regular season games, saying that it was \"difficult, but necessary\" under the \"extraordinary circumstances\".\nThe cancellation of the Bills–Bengals game, however, affected the playoff implications involving four teams: the Bills, Bengals, Kansas City Chiefs, and Baltimore Ravens. Going into the game, Cincinnati held an 11–4 record and only needed a win to clinch the AFC North division title over Baltimore (which was 10–6 after finishing their week 17 game and losing the conference record tiebreaker to the 10–6 Los Angeles Chargers for wild card seeding). The Bengals and the 12–3 Bills were also both fighting the 13–3 Chiefs for the top seed in the AFC.\nHad Buffalo won the canceled game to go to 13–3, and both the Bills and Chiefs then ended the regular season at 14–3, Buffalo would have held the head-to-head victory tiebreaker over Kansas City. In addition, a Cincinnati loss to go to 11–5 would have resulted in the AFC North championship being decided by the Week 18 Ravens–Bengals game, with Baltimore having the head-to-head victory tiebreaker if both teams finished at 11–6. Had Cincinnati won the canceled game instead, not only would have they clinched their division title, but the Bengals would have held head-to-head victory tiebreakers over both the Bills and Chiefs if all three clubs ended at 13–4.\nThe league confirmed that to determine playoff matchups, seeding would still be determined by winning percentage, which the NFL has always formally used to rank teams. By canceling the game, the Bengals automatically clinched the AFC North division championship based on winning percentage. The Chiefs were then put into a position in Week 18 to clinch the AFC top seed with a win to go to 14–3, or for the Bills to finish at 12–4 with a loss.\nTherefore during a special league meeting on January 6, NFL owners approved the following changes for this postseason to compensate for the missing aforementioned playoff implications of the canceled game:\nThe site of the Wild Card game between Baltimore and Cincinnati would be determined by coin flip if:\nAfter Week 18 was played, only the first scenario—caused by wins by both Buffalo and Kansas City—could happen. Meanwhile, Cincinnati won their game against Baltimore. The league then announced on January 12 that Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta was selected to host a Buffalo–Kansas City AFC Championship Game if both teams advanced that far. This plan went unused after the Bengals defeated the Bills in the Divisional Playoffs by the score of 27–10.\nNew postseason overtime rule.\nAs approved by NFL owners at their meeting on March 28, 2022, this is the first postseason in which both teams are assured of one possession in overtime, even if the first team with possession scores a touchdown. This change was made in response to several recent playoff games in which the first team to possess the ball in overtime scored a touchdown and the other team did not have a chance to respond.\nSchedule.\nThe playoffs began on January 14–16, 2023 with the Wild-Card Round, with three wild-card games played in each conference. In the Divisional Round, played January 21–22, the top seed in the conference played the lowest remaining seed and the other two remaining teams played each other. The winners of those games advanced to the Conference Championship Games which were played on January 29. Super Bowl LVII was played on February 12 at State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.\nWild Card playoffs.\nSaturday, January 14, 2023.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 41, Seattle Seahawks 23.\nSan Francisco racked up 505 yards of offense, as they overcame a first-half deficit by scoring 25 unanswered points during the second half.\nSeattle gained 9 yards on the first play, but still had to punt as Kenneth Walker III was tackled for a 1-yard loss by Talanoa Hufanga and quarterback Geno Smith was sacked by Arik Armstead over the next two plays. 49ers' quarterback Brock Purdy then completed a 19-yard pass to Brandon Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel ran for a 22-yard gain as the team drove 48 yards in 7 plays to take a 3–0 lead on Robbie Gould's 34-yard field goal. The Seahawks went three-and-out again on their next drive, and San Francisco advanced the ball upfield for another touchdown, taking advantage of a 68-yard run by Christian McCaffrey and an 18-yard reception by running back Elijah Mitchell. Purdy finished the drive with a 3-yard touchdown pass to McCaffrey, giving San Francisco a 10–0 lead with 5:11 left in the first quarter.\nSeattle responded by moving the ball 78 yards in 14 plays; Walker rushed the ball 5 times for 22 yards, the last carry a 7-yard touchdown run that cut the score to 10–7. The 49ers countered with Purdy completing 3 passes for 51 yards and rushing for 13 to push their lead up to 13–7 on Gould's 33-yard field goal halfway through the second quarter. The Seahawks took the ball back and drove to a 14–13 lead, advancing 71 yards in 5 plays and scoring on Smith's 50-yard pass to DK Metcalf. Following a punt from each team, Purdy completed a 31-yard pass to Aiyuk and an 18-yard pass to Samuel, setting up Gould's 46-yard field goal with 13 seconds left in the half. Seattle receiver Colby Parkinson returned the ensuing squib kick 14 yards to the Seahawks' 38-yard line. On the next play, Smith rushed for 9 yards, with an unnecessary roughness penalty against Jimmie Ward adding another 15 yards and enabling Jason Myers to kick a 56-yard field goal that gave the Seahawks a 17–16 lead at halftime.\nHowever, the 49ers started the second half with three touchdowns and a field goal over their next four possessions. On their first drive of the half, the 49ers had a 15-play, 75-yard drive with Purdy completing passes to George Kittle and Samuel for gains of 23 yards and 21 yards, respectively, before taking the ball into the end zone himself a 1-yard run. Seattle's ensuing possession ended when Charles Omenihu forced a fumble from Smith that Nick Bosa recovered for the 49ers at their 30-yard line. San Francisco then drove 70 yards in 8 plays, the longest a 33-yard catch by Jauan Jennings. Purdy finished the drive with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Mitchell, and then threw a pass to Kittle for a 2-point conversion, giving the team a 31–17 lead. Following a Seattle punt, Purdy threw an 8-yard pass to Samuel, and with blocking from Kittle and Aiyuk, he took it to the end zone for a 74-yard touchdown. On the first play of Seattle's next possession, Deommodore Lenoir intercepted a pass from Smith and returned it 6 yards to the Seahawks' 37-yard line. The 49ers then drove 24 yards and scored on Gould's fourth field goal, this one a 31-yard kick that gave the team a 41–17 lead with less than 5 minutes left. Seattle then drove 76 yards in 15 plays, the longest a 24-yard catch by Cade Johnson, and scored the final points of the game on Smith's 3-yard touchdown pass to Metcalf.\nPurdy—a rookie in his 6th NFL start—finished the game 18-for-30 for 332 yards and 3 touchdowns, while also rushing 4 times for 16 yards and a touchdown; McCaffrey rushed 15 times for 119 yards, while also catching 2 passes for 17 yards and a touchdown; Samuel was the team's top receiver with 6 receptions for 133 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing 3 times for 32 yards and Omenihu had 2 sacks and a forced fumble. For the Seahawks, Smith finished the day 25-for-35 for 253 yards, 2 touchdowns, and an interception, while also rushing 4 times for 28 yards; Metcalf was his top receiver with 10 receptions for 136 yards and 2 touchdowns.\nAFC: Jacksonville Jaguars 31, Los Angeles Chargers 30.\nJacksonville overcame five first-half turnovers and a 27–0 deficit to win on Riley Patterson's walk-off field goal. This was the third largest comeback in NFL postseason history.\nOn the second play of the game, Jags QB Trevor Lawrence's pass was intercepted by Drue Tranquill, who returned it 15 yards to the Jacksonville 18-yard line. This set up Austin Ekeler's 13-yard touchdown run to give the Chargers a 7–0 lead. Then on Jacksonville's next drive, Lawrence was intercepted again, this time by Asante Samuel Jr., who returned the ball 16 yards to the LA 39. From there, quarterback Justin Herbert completed 3 passes for 40 yards on a 57-yard drive to go up 10–0 on Cameron Dicker's 22-yard field goal. Following a punt from each team, Samuel recorded his second interception, returning this one for 4 yards to the Jaguars 16-yard line. Ekeler then took the ball to the end zone with three consecutive carries, the last one a 6-yard touchdown run that gave the Chargers a 17–0 lead with 37 seconds left in the first quarter.\nJacksonville was quickly forced to punt and the Chargers drove back for more points, this time going 67 yards in 13 plays, including Herbert's 23-yard completion to tight end Gerald Everett to convert a 3rd-and-11. On the last play, he hit Everett again for a 9-yard score, increasing the team's lead to 24–0. Jamal Agnew gave the Jags a chance to respond by returning the kickoff 52 yards to midfield. But after two incompletions, Lawrence threw his third interception of the day and fourth overall to Samuel. Then Jacksonville turned the ball over again when Chris Claybrooks muffed a Jags punt and Amen Ogbongbemiga recovered it on the Jaguars 6-yard line. Three plays later, Dicker kicked a 23-yard field goal to give LA a 27–0 lead with 4:28 left in the half. Jacksonville had to punt on their next drive, but their defense forced a crucial three-and-out that included a stop on 3rd-and-1, forcing a J. K. Scott punt that went just 34 yards before Tevaughn Campbell returned it 4 yards to the LA 47-yard line. Lawrence subsequently led the Jags 47 yards in 8 plays, including a 12-yard completion to Marvin Jones on 4th-and-1, to score on a 9-yard touchdown pass to Evan Engram, making the score 27–7 going into halftime.\nLA took the second half kickoff and drove to the Jacksonville 38, but were stopped there and decided to punt. Scott's kick pinned the Jaguars on their own 11-yard line, but it didn't stop them from driving 89 yards in 17 plays. Lawrence completed 8 passes for 68 yards on the drive, the last a 6-yard touchdown completion to Jones that cut their deficit to 27–14. Herbert struck back with a pair of completions to Everett for gains of 21 and 25 yards to set up Dicker's 50-yard field goal, putting the Chargers up 30–14. Agnew returned the kickoff 36 yards to the Jaguars' 32-yard line. From there, Jacksonville drove 68 yards in 7 plays to score on Lawrence's 39-yard touchdown pass to Zay Jones, making the score 30–20 after the 2-point conversion failed.\nLos Angeles got the ball back with 40 seconds left in the third quarter and managed to run the clock down to under nine minutes with a 17-play drive to the Jags 22-yard line, but came up empty when Dicker's 40-yard field goal went wide left. Jacksonville took over and drove 64 yards in 11 plays, with Lawrence completing a 21-yard pass to Engram and 3 passes to Christian Kirk for 35 yards, the last a 9-yard touchdown catch. Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa was penalized for unsportsmanlike conduct on the play, moving the ball to the 1-yard for the point after touchdown. The Jaguars took advantage of the penalty by going for two, scoring on Lawrence's 1-yard run to cut their deficit to 30–28 with 5:30 left in the game.\nOn the first play after the ensuing kickoff, Herbert was sacked for an 8-yard loss by Roy Robertson-Harris. He managed to complete passes on his next two plays, but they were not enough for a first down, and so the Chargers punted with 3:20 remaining. Jacksonville then put together a 10-play, 61-yard drive for the game-winning score. Three completions for 24 yards and an 8-yard run by Lawrence brought up first down at midfield. A few plays later, they faced a crucial 4th-and-1 on the Chargers 41-yard line. Travis Etienne took a pitch and ran around the right side of the line for a 25-yard gain to the Chargers 16. After running the clock down to the final seconds, Patterson's 36-yard field goal gave the Jags a win as time ran out. It is the largest blown lead in Chargers history as they became the first team to lose a playoff game with a turnover margin of +5.\nLawrence completed 28 of 47 passes for 288 yards and 4 touchdowns, with 4 interceptions, and rushed once for 8 yards. Etienne was the top rusher of the day with 20 carries for 109 yards and caught a pass for 12 yards. Engram had 7 receptions for 93 yards and a score. Agnew returned 4 kickoffs for 134 yards. Herbert finished 27 of 43 for 273 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing 3 times for 12 yards. Everett was his top target with 6 catches for 109 yards and a score. Samuel had 3 tackles and 3 interceptions. Ekeler, who had 1,637 yards from scrimmage and 107 receptions during the season, scored two touchdowns, but was held to just 13 carries for 35 yards and 2 receptions for 8 yards. Chargers coach Brandon Staley was later quoted as saying that \"we choked\", a sentiment also said by linebacker Kyle Van Noy.\nFollowing the game, Los Angeles fired offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi and passing game coordinator &amp; quarterbacks coach Shane Day.\nSunday, January 15, 2023.\nAFC: Buffalo Bills 34, Miami Dolphins 31.\nDespite having to start third string quarterback Skylar Thompson, falling behind 17–0, and being outgained in total yards 423–231, Miami still managed to keep pace with the heavily favored Bills, falling just short when Buffalo's defense stopped them on consecutive plays when facing 3rd-and-1 on their final drive. This became the longest home game in Bills history, at 3 hours and 53 minutes.\nBuffalo started the game with a drive to the Dolphins 32, but lost the ball due to an incompletion on 4th-and-3. Following a punt, Bills quarterback Josh Allen completed passes to Stefon Diggs for gains of 20 and 52 yards before connecting with tight end Dawson Knox in the end zone for a 6-yard touchdown. Then safety Dean Marlowe intercepted a pass from Thompson and returned it 10 yards to the Miami 23-yard line, James Cook's 12-yard touchdown run that put the Bills up 14–0. Miami was quickly forced to punt again, and the Bills stormed back for more points, this time driving 57 yards in 12 plays, with Allen completing 3/5 passes for 41 yards and rushing for 8, before Tyler Bass' 40-yard field goal gave the team a 17–0 lead with 12:49 left in the second quarter.\nThe Dolphins finally managed to respond on their next possession. Thompson start it off with a 20-yard completion to Durham Smythe, and later threw one to Tyreek Hill for a 19-yard gain on the Bills 16-yard line. Jason Sanders finished the drive with a 40-yard field goal that cut the score to 17–3. On the Bills ensuing drive, Allen threw a pass that was intercepted by Xavien Howard and returned 49 yards to the Buffalo 47, leading to Sanders' 48-yard field goal that made the score 17–6 following a 23-yard drive. Buffalo then went three-and-out, and Cedrick Wilson returned their punt 50 yards to the Bills 27-yard line, resulting in Sanders' third consecutive field goal, this one a 39-yard kick, that reduced their deficit to 17–9. Then Allen threw another interception, this one to Jevon Holland, who ran it back 29 yards to the Buffalo 18. This time the Dolphins managed to get the ball into the end zone, scoring on Thompson's 7-yard touchdown pass to tight end Mike Gesicki. He also threw a pass to Hill for a 2-point conversion, tying the game at 17 with 33 seconds left in the half. Still, Buffalo managed to retake the lead at 20–17 before halftime, with Allen completing two passes for Gabe Davis for gains of 33 and 17 yards on the way to Bass' 39-yard field goal.\nMiami took their first lead of the game, 24–20, just one minute into the second half when safety Eric Rowe sacked Allen and forced a fumble, which Zach Sieler picked up and returned 5 yards for a touchdown. But later in the quarter, cornerback Kaiir Elam intercepted a pass from Thompson on the Dolphins 33-yard line, leading to Allens' 6-yard touchdown pass to Cole Beasley that gave Buffalo the lead back, 27–24. Following a Miami punt, Allen completed passes to Quintin Morris and Beasley for gains of 12 and 29 yards before finding Davis in the end zone for a 23-yard touchdown completion, increasing Buffalo's lead to 34–24.\nMiami responded on a drive where Thompson completed 4/5 passes for 59 yards on the way to Jeff Wilson's 1-yard touchdown run, narrowing the gap to 34–31 with just over 10 minutes left in the fourth quarter. Following three drives without points, Sam Martin's 44-yard punt gave the Dolphins the ball on their own 14-yard line with 4:24 on the clock. Thompson's 25-yard completion to Jaylen Waddle on 3rd-and-10 advanced the team to the 39. After an offsides penalty and an incompletion, his 14-yard pass to Waddle brought up 3rd-and-1 from the 48. On the next play, Salvon Ahmed was stuffed for no gain by linebacker Matt Milano. Now with just 2:29 left and no timeouts, Miami had to go for the conversion. However, they were pushed back 5 yards by a delay of game penalty before they could run their next play. Then on 4th-and-6, Thompson's pass was incomplete, enabling Buffalo to take over and run out the rest of the clock, picking up their last needed first down with two runs by Devin Singletary for 11 total yards.\nAllen was 23/39 for 352 yards and 3 touchdowns, while rushing 4 times for 20, but was intercepted twice and lost a fumble. Diggs was the game's leading receiver with 7 catches for 114 yards, while Davis had 6 for 113 and a score. Milano had 10 tackles (8 solo) and 2 sacks. Thompson threw for 220 yards and a touchdown, but completed just 18 of 45 passes and was picked off twice. Hill was the Dolphins leading receiver with 7 receptions for 69 yards.\nNFC: New York Giants 31, Minnesota Vikings 24.\nThe Giants had won two of the first three playoff meetings with the Vikings, most recently a 41–0 Giants victory in the 2000 NFC Championship. In Week 16 of the regular season, the Vikings beat the Giants 27–24 in Minneapolis. This was the Giants' first playoff game in six years, and the first for the Vikings in three years. It was also the Vikings first home playoff game since the Minneapolis Miracle. This was the first career postseason game for both Brian Daboll and Kevin O'Connell as head coaches.\nThe Vikings started with the ball and moved downfield with ease. Kirk Cousins was 7/7 for 48 yards on the opening drive, including four completions to Justin Jefferson, before he converted a QB sneak on 2nd-and-goal to give the team a 7–0 lead. The Giants, however, immediately responded with an 85-yard drive. After an opening play holding penalty, Daniel Jones gained 56 yards running and passing over the next four plays, the longest a 22-yard throw to Darius Slayton. On the next play, Saquon Barkley ran 29 yards to the endzone untouched to tie the game. Then the Vikings went three-and-out after failing to convert a flea flicker. Jones immediately connected with Slayton on a 47-yard catch and run. Then Barkley rushed for a 16-yard gain before Jones' 14-yard touchdown pass to Isaiah Hodgins gave the Giants a 14–7 lead. After another punt, the Giants went on a 20-play, 85-yard drive that lasted nearly 11 minutes, but had to settle for a 25-yard Graham Gano field goal after a touchdown was called off by an illegal shift penalty by Daniel Bellinger. Cousins started connecting with T. J. Hockenson on the next drive with completions of 27 and 28 yards, then found K. J. Osborn open for a 9-yard touchdown to make the score 17–14 before halftime.\nThe Giants extended their lead to 24–14 on the first drive of the third quarter when Jones hit Bellinger for a 9-yard touchdown pass after a 24-yard run by Barkley and a 32-yard catch by Hodgins. Cousins and the Vikings responded with another touchdown, this time to TE Irv Smith after a 19-yard completion to Hockenson on 3rd-and-7, along with a 25-yard pass to Adam Thielen. After giving up points on the first four Giants drives, the Vikings defense finally stopped the Giants on a third-down sack of Jones by Danielle Hunter. Sensing an opportunity to take control of the game, the Vikings went on a long and methodical drive that extended into the 4th quarter. On 3rd-and-9 at the NYG-24, Cousins completed a pass to Hockenson and was tackled by Xavier McKinney and Tony Jefferson. Initially ruled a first down, replay confirmed Hockenson was tackled half a yard short of the line to gain. The Vikings lined up for a QB sneak and got the first down, but were flagged for a false start by OT Christian Darrisaw. Greg Joseph kicked the ensuing 38-yard field goal to tie the game at 24 with 12:34 to play.\nJones connected with Slayton and Richie James on consecutive plays to move the ball to midfield. Then Hodgins made a toe-tapping grab on the sideline to put the Giants in Vikings territory for a 19-yard gain, then Barkley took a screen pass 10 yards into the red zone after a key block by Kenny Golladay. James had a 4-yard catch on 3rd-and-5, and the Giants opted to go for the first down instead of the field goal, which Jones converted on a QB sneak. Barkley scored his second touchdown of the game on the next play on a 2-yard run to give the Giants a 31–24 lead with 7:47 on the clock. Then the Vikings went three-and-out. The Giants tried to burn clock and score to put the game out of reach, but Slayton dropped a potential game-winning catch and run on 3rd-and-15. The Vikings only got one first down on their final drive on a roughing the passer penalty on Dexter Lawrence. Cousins's third down attempt was batted down by Cordale Flott. On 4th-and-8, Cousins was forced to check down to Hockenson with McKinney in pursuit. McKinney made the tackle 5 yards short of the first down and the Giants got the ball back. The Vikings had no timeouts and the Giants kneeled the clock out.\nThe Giants advanced to play the Philadelphia Eagles and won their first playoff game since Super Bowl XLVI in the 2011 season. Daniel Jones orchestrated his sixth game-winning drive of the season and became the first person in NFL history to accumulate 300-plus passing yards, 75-plus rushing yards, and 2-plus passing touchdowns in a playoff game. His 379 scrimmage yards in a playoff game set a franchise record by a Giants quarterback. Saquon Barkley only ran the ball 9 times for 53 yards, but tacked on two scores and an additional 56 yards on 5 catches. Kirk Cousins played well for the Vikings, throwing 273 yards, 2 passing touchdowns, and a rushing touchdown. T.J. Hockenson was the Vikings leading receiver with 129 yards on 10 catches and Justin Jefferson, despite his opening drive, only finished with 47 yards on 7 catches. Isaiah Hodgins had his first career 100-yard receiving game and finished with 8 catches, 105 yards, and a touchdown despite revealing he played through an ankle injury.\nAFC: Cincinnati Bengals 24, Baltimore Ravens 17.\nIn a second half dominated by defense, Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard's NFL postseason record 98-yard fumble return touchdown gave the team a lead they would never give up, enabling them to win despite gaining just 234 offensive yards.\nCincinnati running back Joe Mixon rushed 3 times for 19 yards and caught 2 passes for 9 as the team advanced 54 yards in 15 plays to score on Evan McPherson's 39-yard field goal on the game's opening drive. On the fifth play of Baltimore's ensuing drive, reserve linebacker Akeem Davis-Gaither intercepted a pass from Tyler Huntley on the Bengals 40-yard line. Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow subsequently completed 7/7 passes for 69 yards, the last a 7-yard scoring completion to Ja'Marr Chase that put the Bengals up 9–0 after McPherson missed the extra point, his fifth missed extra point kick of the season.\nTaking the ball back seconds into the second quarter, Baltimore went on a 20-play, 72-yard drive that took 10:03 off the clock, the longest playoff drive in franchise history. Running back J. K. Dobbins carried the ball 5 times for 20 yards and scored on a 2-yard catch from Huntley by managing to barely stretch the ball across the goal line as he was being tackled, making the score 9–7 with less than 5 minutes left until halftime. At the end of the Bengals next drive, safety Kyle Hamilton forced and recovered a fumble from tight end Hayden Hurst on the Cincy 44-yard line. Baltimore then drove 40 yards in 9 plays, the longest a 19-yard completion from Huntley to Josh Oliver, and took a 10–9 lead on Justin Tucker's 22-yard field goal in the closing seconds of the quarter.\nAfter forcing the Ravens to punt, Cincinnati started the second half with a 15-play, 88-yard drive. Burrow completed 6/6 passes for 65 yards, including a 19-yard pass to Chase and an 18-yard throw to Hurst on the Baltimore 1-yard line. Burrow scored a touchdown with a QB sneak on the next play. His ensuing 2-point conversion pass to Tee Higgins was incomplete, but a penalty of defensive back Marcus Peters gave Burrow another chance, and his next pass to Higgins was good, giving the Bengals a 17–10 lead. The Ravens quickly stormed back to tie the game 17–17, with Huntley throwing a 27-yard completion to Dobbins and a 13-yard pass to Gus Edwards before hitting Demarcus Robinson with a 41-yard touchdown bomb.\nFollowing a Bengals punt, Baltimore got the ball with 54 seconds left in the third quarter and launched a drive deep into the red zone. After a 25-yard completion to Mark Andrews, Huntley took off for a 35-yard run before Jessie Bates managed to tackle him at the Bengals 2-yard line. Two plays later on 3rd-and-goal from the 1, Huntley attempted to stretch the ball over the line of scrimmage, but linebacker Logan Wilson knocked the ball out of his hands, right into the arms of Hubbard, who raced 98 yards down the field for a touchdown to put the Bengals ahead at 24–17 with 11:54 left in the game.\nThe defenses from both teams then took over as both teams punted twice. With 3:25 left on the clock, Ravens receiver James Proche returned Drue Chrisman's 49-yard punt 16 yards, with a penalty against defensive back Daxton Hill adding another 5 and giving Baltimore the ball on the Bengals 46-yard line. Huntley led the team to a first down on the Bengals 17-yard line, personally converting a 4th-and-1 with a 4-yard run along the way. But over the next 3 plays, Huntley threw incompletions and a holding penalty on lineman Kevin Zeitler pushed them back 10 yards. Now faced with 4th-and-20 from the Bengals 27 with 8 seconds left, Huntley was chased back to midfield before he launched a hail mary pass to the end zone. The ball was deflected in the end zone and then bounced off the fingertips of Proche as he attempted to make a diving catch, enabling Cincy to narrowly escape with the win.\nBurrow completed 23/32 passes for 209 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing for 9 yards and a score. Chase was the game's leading receiver with 9 receptions for 84 yards and a touchdown. Starting in place of the injured Lamar Jackson, Huntley finished the day 17/29 for 226 yards, two touchdowns and an interception, while also rushing 9 times for 54 yards. Dobbins had 13 carries for 62 yards and caught 4 passes for 43 yards and a score. Hamilton had a forced fumble, a fumble recovery, and 9 total tackles (5 solo).\nMonday, January 16, 2023.\nNFC: Dallas Cowboys 31, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 14.\nDallas dominated the game, running up a 24-point lead and keeping the Buccaneers scoreless until 5 seconds remained in the third quarter. The only downside for the Cowboys was the performance of kicker Brett Maher, who missed the extra point kick on their first four touchdowns. His four misses were an NFL postseason record. This would end up being Tom Brady's final game before his retirement two weeks later.\nThe game started out sluggish as both teams failed to gain any net positive yardage on the first four drives. On the next possession, Dallas moved the ball 65 yards in 8 plays. Tony Pollard rushed 4 times for 25 yards, while quarterback Dak Prescott completed passes to Michael Gallup and Noah Brown for gains of 15 and 18 yards before connecting with tight end Dalton Schultz in the end zone for a 22-yard score. Tampa Bay took the ball back and drove to a 2nd-and-goal on the Cowboys 5-yard line. But on the first play of the second quarter, Tom Brady was intercepted in the end zone by safety Jayron Kearse. It was Brady's first red zone interception in his three seasons as the Bucs quarterback, a fact highlighted by commentator Joe Buck's statement before the play: \"Inside the red zone—that's where they are, that's why the fire the cannons and that's where Tom Brady just simply does not turn the ball over.\"\nAfter the turnover, Dallas drove 90 yards in 16 plays, the longest a 34-yard completion from Prescott to tight end Jake Ferguson. Prescott finished the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run on 4th-and-goal, increasing their lead to 12–0. Following a punt, Prescott completed 8/8 passes for 83 yards, including three to Schultz for gains of 20, 6, and an 11-yard touchdown pass, putting the team up 18–0 with 34 seconds left in the half.\nDallas scored again on their first drive of the third quarter. Prescott completed a 26-yard pass to Schultz on the first play, and later picked up another 26 yards on a pass to CeeDee Lamb, while Pollard rushed four times for 30 yards. Prescott finished it off with a 2-yard touchdown toss to Michael Gallup for a 24–0 lead. Later in the period, Bryan Anger's 42-yard punt pinned the Buccaneers back on their own 5-yard line. But this time they managed to score, with Brady completing 7/8 passes for 92 yards, the last a 30-yard touchdown to Julio Jones that made the score 24–6 after a failed 2-point attempt.\nKaVontae Turpin returned the ensuing kickoff 35 yards to the 32-yard line. From there, Dallas drove 68 yards in 11 plays, with Prescott completing four passes for double-digit gains, the last an 18-yard touchdown completion to Gallup that made the score 31–6 and put the game out of reach. All Tampa Bay could do with the time remaining was convert Deven Thompkins' 14-yard punt return into a 52-yard drive to score the final points on Brady's 8-yard touchdown completion to Cameron Brate and subsequent 2-point conversion pass to Mike Evans.\nPrescott completed 25/33 passes for 305 yards and four touchdowns, while also rushing 7 times for 24 yards and another score. Schultz was his top receiver with 7 receptions for 95 yards and two touchdowns, while Pollard rushed for 77 yards and caught 3 passes for 12. Brady finished his last game completing 35 of 66 pass attempts, just two attempts short of the all-time record, for 351 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. Chris Godwin was the Bucs leading receiver with 10 receptions for 85 yards, while Jones had 7 for 74 and a touchdown. Thompkins returned 3 kickoffs for 58 yards and 3 punts for 34.\nDivisional playoffs.\nSaturday, January 21, 2023.\nAFC: Kansas City Chiefs 27, Jacksonville Jaguars 20.\nDespite an injury late in the first quarter to starting quarterback Patrick Mahomes, Kansas City gained a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter and held on to win by forcing turnovers on two of Jacksonville's final three drives, advancing them to their fifth consecutive AFC title game.\nAfter Jacksonville punted on the opening drive, Mahomes completed 7 of 8 passes for 69 yards, the last a 6-yard touchdown throw to tight end Travis Kelce. Jamal Agnew returned the kickoff 63 yards to the Chiefs 39-yard line. From there the team got to the end zone in seven plays, with Travis Etienne's 19-yard run setting up Trevor Lawrence's 10 yard touchdown pass to Christian Kirk that tied the score 7–7. Mahomes responded by completing 6 of 7 passes for 27 yards and rushing for 10 yards to lead the team to a 10–7 with Harrison Butker's 50-yard field less than a minute into the second quarter. However, he suffered an ankle injury on the drive and missed the next series.\nAt the end of the Jags next possession, Logan Cooke's 39-yard punt pinned Kansas City back at their own 2-yard line.

On the next play, Mahomes completed a 27-yard pass to tight end Noah Gray, setting up Butker's 50-yard field goal that gave the team a 20–10 lead with 12 seconds left in the third quarter.\nNow down two scores, Jacksonville stormed back with their longest drive of the game, going 80 yards in 10 plays. Lawrence completed passes to Zay Jones for gains of 12 and 37 yards, while also scrambling for an 11-yard gain.

Etienne ran the ball in for a touchdown on the next play, making the score 20–17. But Kansas City struck right back, driving 70 yards in 13 plays, with Mahomes completing two passes to Kelce for 26 yards and one to JuJu Smith-Schuster for 16 yards. Following a 14-yard run by Toney on an end around, Mahomes finished the drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to Marquez Valdes-Scantling, putting the team up 27–17 with just over 7 minutes left to play.\nAgnew returned Kansas City's kickoff 42 yards to his own 45-yard line, with only Butker's touchdown-stopping tackle preventing him from taking it all the way. After that, Lawrence completed a 16-yard pass to Evan Engram and an 18-yard pass to Jones before his 11-yard run gave the team a first down on the Chiefs 9-yard line. On the next play, Agnew caught a pass, but lost the ball while being tackled by L'Jarius Sneed, Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton recovered the fumble. After the Jaguars defense forced Kansas City to punt, Chiefs defensive back Jaylen Watson intercepted a pass from Lawrence that enabled the team to run the clock down to 1:04. Once Jacksonville got the ball back, Lawrence completed 3 passes for 37 yards to set up Patterson's 48-yard field goal, but the team failed to recover the onside kick, which allowed Kansas City to run out the clock.\nMahomes completed 22 of 30 passes for 195 yards and two touchdowns, while also rushing for 8 yards. Pacheco was the top rusher of the game with 12 carries for 95 yards, and caught a pass for 6 yards. Kelce caught 12 passes for 98 yards and two scores.

The Eagles were particularly effective on the ground, racking up 268 rushing yards, the second highest postseason total in franchise history.\nThe Eagles started off the game with a 10-play, 75-yard drive featuring a 40-yard pass from Jalen Hurts to DeVonta Smith. His 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Goedert gave the team a 7–0 lead. New York took the ball and drove to a 3rd-and-3 on the Eagles 35-yard line.

Their offensive line, missing three starters with injuries, proved up to the challenge as they only gave up 1 sack, while the team rushed for 172 yards and averaged 5.1 yards per carry. This was the team's fifth postseason victory over the last two seasons, the same number of wins the team had in their entire history prior to then.\nCincinnati took the opening kickoff and stormed 79 yards in 8 plays, with Joe Burrow completing 4/4 passes for 64 yards, including a 23-yard completion to Tyler Boyd, and finish the drive with a 28-yard touchdown throw to Ja'Marr Chase. Buffalo quickly had to punt and the Bengals marched back to score again, this time moving the ball 64 yards in 12 plays. Joe Mixon started the drive with two carries for 21 yards, while Burrow completed 5/5 passes for 41, ending on his 15-yard touchdown pass to tight end Hayden Hurst. By the time the first quarter ended, Buffalo trailed 14–0 and had gained just 8 total offensive yards.\nBuffalo finally managed to get rolling on their first drive of the second quarter, scoring on a 17-play, 85-yard drive. Josh Allen completed passes to Stefon Diggs and Khalil Shakir for gains of 16 and 23 yards, while also converting a 4th-and-1 with a 2-yard sneak before taking the ball into the end zone himself for a 1-yard rushing score. Cincy countered by moving 70 yards in 16 plays, the longest an 18-yard pass from Burrow to Hurst. Evan McPherson finished the drive with 28-yard field goal, giving the Bengals a 17–7 lead with 1:43 left in the half.\nBuffalo cut their deficit down to 7 points on the first drive of the second half, with Devin Singletary rushing 3 times for 16 yards and Shakir catching a pass for 17 on the way to Tyler Bass' 25-yard field goal. But this would be as close as they would get, as Cincinnati scored again on their next possession. This one went for 71 yards in 17 plays, with Mixon rushing 5 times for 25 and finishing it off with a 1-yard touchdown run that put the team up 24–10. Then Buffalo went three-and-out, and Sam Martin's 43-yard punt gave the Bengals the ball on their 37-yard line on the last play of the third quarter.\nFrom there, Cincy drove 35 yards in 10 plays, 27 of them on four carries by Mixon. The Bengals also took advantage of a 26-yard pass interference penalty on Jordan Poyer on a play in which he also collided with fellow defensive back Tre'Davious White sending both of them to the sidelines with injuries and giving the Bengals a first and goal on the Bills 4-yard line. The defense still managed to keep Cincinnati out of the end zone, but McPherson's 20-yard field goal gave the team a 27–10 lead with just over 11 minutes left in the game. Buffalo took the ball back and drove to a 4th-and-6 on the Bengals 16-yard line. Allen attempted to pick up the first down with a pass to Gabe Davis, but cornerback Eli Apple broke it up to force a turnover on downs. Following a punt, Bengals rookie Cam Taylor-Britt sealed the victory by intercepting a pass from Allen in the end zone with a little over 1 minute remaining on the clock.\nBurrow completed 23/36 passes for 242 yards and 2 touchdowns, while also rushing six times for 36 yards. Mixon rushed 20 times for 105 yards and a touchdown, while also catching 2 passes for 18. Allen completed 25/42 passes for 265 yards and an interception and had 8 carries for 26 yards and a score. Linebacker Matt Milano had 10 tackles (7 solo) and a sack.\nNFC: San Francisco 49ers 19, Dallas Cowboys 12.\n49ers quarterback Brock Purdy's storybook season continued as he won his 7th consecutive start and became the first rookie quarterback to lead his team to a conference championship game since Mark Sanchez in the 2009 season.\nFollowing several punts, 49ers defensive back Deommodore Lenoir intercepted a pass from Dak Prescott and returned it 6 yards to the Cowboys 21-yard line. Purdy subsequently managed to convert a 3rd-and-16 with a 17-yard completion to Brandon Aiyuk on the Dallas 10, but the team could still not dent the end zone and had to settle for Robbie Gould's 26-yard field goal with 2:16 left in the first quarter.\nDallas responded by moving the ball 79 yards in 17 plays, the longest being an 18-yard completion from Prescott to Noah Brown. He later finished it off with a 4-yard touchdown pass to Dalton Schultz, giving the Cowboys a 6–3 lead after Brett Maher's extra point was blocked by Samson Ebukam, Maher's fifth missed extra point of the postseason. The 49ers managed to tie the game by driving 41 yards in 12 plays, taking advantage of a 15-yard penalty against Dallas and a 17-yard reception by Deebo Samuel, scoring on Gould's 47-yard field goal. Dallas took the ball back and drove to the 49ers 18-yard line, only to lose it on an interception by linebacker Fred Warner who returned it 16 yards to his own 28. Purdy then completed a 10-yard pass to Samuel and a 21-yard pass to Jauan Jennings, setting up Gould's 50-yard field goal to give the team a 9–6 lead on the last play of the half.\nDallas had to punt on their opening drive of the third quarter, but Kelvin Joseph forced a fumble from returner Ray-Ray McCloud, and Damone Clark recovered it for the Cowboys on the San Francisco 21-yard line. This led to Maher's 25-yard field goal that tied the game at 9. McCloud returned their kickoff 53 yards to the Dallas 47, but the team could not gain a first down and had to punt. Following another punt, San Francisco retook the lead with a 14-play, 76-yard possession. The highlight of the drive was a 30-yard completion from Purdy to tight end George Kittle, who had to fully extend his arms and tip the ball to himself, bouncing it off his helmet before securing it for a catch. Christian McCaffrey finished the drive with a 2-yard touchdown run, giving the team a 16–9 lead on the first play of the fourth quarter.\nKaVontae Turpin returned the ensuing kickoff 44 yards to the Dallas 42, stopped from taking it all the way only by a tackle from Gould. From there, Prescott's three completions to CeeDee Lamb for 29 yards set up a 43-yard field goal to make the score 16–12. San Francisco then went on a 14-play, 64-yard drive, with Purdy completing a 17-yard pass to Kittle, while Elijah Mitchell carried the ball 8 times for 26 yards. Gould's 28-yard field goal put the team back up by 7 points with 3:08 left on the clock. The 49ers defense took over from that point, first forcing a punt, and later stopping Dallas on their own 32 as time expired in the game.\nPurdy completed 19 of 29 passes for 214 yards, while also rushing for 8. Kittle was his top receiver with 5 receptions for 95 yards. Prescott completed 23 of 37 passes for 206 yards and a touchdown, while also rushing 4 times for 22 yards, but was intercepted twice. Lamb was the top receiver of the game with 10 receptions for 117 yards. Turpin returned 4 kickoffs for 120 yards.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 29, 2023.\nNFC Championship Game: Philadelphia Eagles 31, San Francisco 49ers 7.\nSan Francisco was unable to recover from injuries to quarterbacks Brock Purdy, Josh Johnson, Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. With no more healthy quarterbacks on their roster, the team only mustered 164 yards of offense, while also committing 11 penalties for 84 yards.\nPhiladelphia running back Boston Scott started off the game with a 29-yard kickoff return to his 34-yard line. Quarterback Jalen Hurts subsequently completed 5/7 passes for 54 yards, the longest a 29-yard throw to DeVonta Smith, who made a one-handed catch on 4th-and-3 to give the Eagles a first down on the San Francisco 6-yard line despite replays showing that he did not complete the catch. Miles Sanders ran the ball into the end zone from there to give the team a 7–0 lead. San Francisco took the ball and drove to midfield, but then Haason Reddick sacked Purdy as he was winding up for a pass, and Linval Joseph recovered it for the Eagles. Purdy's throwing arm was injured on the play, and he missed the rest of the half.\nSeveral possessions later, 49ers punter Mitch Wishnowsky's 38-yard kick pinned the Eagles back at their own 6-yard line. Philadelphia ended up punting back to San Francisco from their 2, and Ray-Ray McCloud's 9-yard return gave them a first down on the Eagles 46-yard line. Running back Christian McCaffrey went on to get the ball on six of the 49ers next seven plays, gaining 44 of the drive's 46 yards and finishing it off with a 25-yard touchdown run in which he evaded 4 tackle attempts on the way to the end zone. The score was now tied with about 7 minutes left in the second quarter, but Philadelphia would go on to dominate the rest of the game. On their next drive, they took advantage of 3 penalties against San Francisco, marching 66 in 20 plays, the longest a 17-yard run by Kenneth Gainwell. Sanders completed the series with a 13-yard touchdown run, giving the team a 14–7 lead. On San Francisco's ensuing possession, Johnson fumbled a snap in shotgun formation. Reddick recovered the ball on the 49ers 30-yard line, setting up Scott's 10-yard touchdown run that increased Philadelphia's lead to 21–7 in the closing seconds of the first half.\nOn San Francisco's opening drive of the half, Johnson was knocked out of the game with a concussion, forcing the sore-armed Purdy back in to lead the team's offense. He would throw only two passes for the rest of the game. Midway through the third quarter, the Eagles went on another long scoring drive, this one covering 72 yards in 16 plays, one of them a 17-yard completion from Hurts to Gainwell on 3rd-and-5. Hurts also had a 14-yard run to give the team a first and goal, and eventually took the ball across the goal line himself on a 1-yard run. Now down 28–7, San Francisco lost the ball on their next drive attempting to convert a 4th-and-3 on their own 47-yard line. Gainwell then ran down the clock with 8 consecutive carries for 30 yards, setting up the final points of the game on Jake Elliott's 31-yard field goal with 5:20 left in the game.\nHurts completed 15 of 25 passes for 121 yards, while rushing 11 times for 39 yards and a touchdown. Reddick had 3 tackles (2 solo), 2 sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. Purdy and Johnson combined for just 97 passing yards. McCaffrey was the sole offensive star of the day with 15 carries for 84 yards and a touchdown, along with 4 receptions for 22 yards.\nAfter the game, it was revealed Purdy had suffered a torn ulnar collateral ligament in his right elbow and would have to undergo surgery in the offseason.\nAFC Championship Game: Kansas City Chiefs 23, Cincinnati Bengals 20.\nSkyy Moore's 29-yard punt return set up a 45-yard field goal for Harrison Butker with 3 seconds left to send Kansas City to their third Super Bowl in the last four seasons.\nCincinnati had to punt on their opening drive, and Kadarius Toney's 12-yard return gave Kansas City the ball on their own 36 yard line. A pair of 16 yard completions from Patrick Mahomes to Isiah Pacheco set up Butker's 43-yard field goal to give the team an early 3–0 lead. The Bengals quickly had to punt again and KC storm back for another score, with Mahomes completing 6/8 passes for 69 yards as the team advanced to the Bengals 9-yard line. Pacheno scored on a touchdown run, but it was called back by a holding penalty and the Chiefs ended up settling for Butker's field 24-yard field goal on the first play of the second quarter. Kansas City had dominated the game up to then, gaining 110 yards and six first downs, while holding Cincinnati to 0 yards and one first down, sacking quarterback Joe Burrow three times.\nCincinnati responded on their next drive, as Burrow converted a 3rd-and-14 with a 16-yard pass to Tyler Boyd, and later hit him for a 24-yard gain to set up Evan McPherson's 30-yard field goal that made the score 6–3. Kansas City stormed right back 75 yards in 10 plays, including a 29-yard completion from Mahomes to Marquez Valdes-Scantling. On the last play, he converted a 4th-and-1 with a 14-yard touchdown pass to Travis Kelce, giving the team a 13–3 lead. On the Bengals next drive, Burrow threw a pass that was intercepted by Jaylen Watson and returned 10 yards to the team's 39-yard line. However, their defense managed to force 3 incompletions and a punt, which Tommy Townsend sent out of bounds at the Bengals 5-yard line. Aided by a 20-yard pass interference penalty against Bryan Cook that negated an interception by Juan Thornhill, Burrow led Cincy 70 yards in 13 plays, completing 8/10 passes for 62 yards before McPherson's 20-yard field goal on the last play of the quarter sent the teams into their locker rooms with a score of 13–6.\nAfter forcing the Chiefs to punt, Cincinnati tied the score on their first drive of the second half, moving the ball 62 yards in 9 plays and scoring on Burrow's 27-yard touchdown pass to Tee Higgins. But the Chiefs stormed right back to retake it at 20–13, with Mahomes completing 3 passes to Valdez-Scantling for 52 yards, the last a 19-yard touchdown completion on 3rd-and-10. After Cincinnati punted, Mahomes led the Chiefs to the Bengals 43-yard line. But with a minute left in the third quarter, he fumbled the ball while winding up for a pass without being touched. Bengals defensive end Sam Hubbard recovered it on the KC 45-yard line. The team soon faced 4th-and-6 from the Chiefs 40, but Burrow managed to convert with a long pass to Ja'Marr Chase, who made a leaping catch between two defensive backs for a 35-yard gain. This set up Samaje Perine's 2-yard rushing score that tied the game at 20–20 with 13:35 left in the 4th quarter.\nAfter a Chiefs punt, Burrow was intercepted by Joshua Williams on the Chiefs' 14-yard line. Kansas City then drove a 3rd-and-12 on the Bengals 41. On the next play, Kansas City gained 4 yards and was penalized for holding. Rather than take the penalty, coach Zac Taylor decided to accept the results of the play, forcing Kansas City to decide on a punt or a long field goal. The Chiefs decided to punt, and got a big boost from Townshend, who kicked the ball out of bounds at the Bengals 6-yard line. Cincinnati subsequently drove to their own 35, featuring a 23-yard completion from Burrow to tight end Hayden Hurst on 3rd-and-16. But on 3rd-and-8, Burrow was sacked for an 8-yard loss by Chris Jones, forcing the team to punt the ball back to Kansas City with 40 seconds left on the clock.\nSkyy Moore returned Drue Chrisman's 54-yard punt 29 yards to the Chiefs 47-yard line. On the next play, Mahomes completed a pass to Pacheco for 6 yards. Then when faced with 3rd-and-4 with 17 seconds left, Mahomes scrambled 5 yards for a first down. Bengals defensive end Joseph Ossai was penalized 15 yards for shoving Mahomes after he stepped out of bounds, giving Kansas City another 15 yards on the end of the run. Now with just 8 seconds left, Butker's 45-yard field goal gave the team a 23–20 win.\nPlaying on an injured ankle, Mahomes completed 29/43 passes for 326 yards and 2 touchdowns, while also rushing for 8 yards. Valdez-Scantling was the top receiver of the game with 6 receptions for 116 yards and a touchdown. Kelce had 7 catches for 78 yards and a score. Townsend planted 3 of his 4 punts inside the 20. Burrow completed 26/41 passes for 270 yards and a touchdown. He was also the team's leading rusher with 4 carries for 30 yards, but was intercepted twice and sacked 5 times. Higgins was the Bengals leading receiver with 6 receptions for 83 yards and a touchdown.\nTelevision coverage.\nAll playoff games were televised nationally, split between the league's network television partners.\nDuring Wild Card Weekend this postseason, Fox replaced CBS in televising two wild card games this year, with CBS airing only one wild card game.

        "text": "The 2022–23 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's ice hockey season was the 63rd season of play for the program and 6th in the Big Ten Conference. The Fighting Irish represented the University of Notre Dame in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. They were coached by Jeff Jackson, in his 17th season and played their home games at Compton Family Ice Arena.\nSeason.\nEntering the season, coach Jackson brought back a veteran lineup and augmented the roster with several graduate transfers. With Nick Leivermann leading the defensive corps and Ryan Bischel holding the crease, Notre Dame was well apportioned on the back end. Unfortunately, the team had a severe lack of offense. Over the course of the year, the Fighting Irish scored 42 fewer goals than they had in 2022. That dramatic drop-off had a chilling effect on a team that had national aspirations. The Irish hovered around .500 for most of the season and were only once able to string more than two wins together. Fortunately, for Notre Dame, the Big Ten was the strongest conference this season and enabled the team to be in position for a potential at-large bid despite having nearly as many wins as losses.\nThe Irish ended the regular season well, taking two consecutive weekends from high-ranked teams and raising themselves into the top-16. The good stretch also lifted the team up to 4th in the conference standings, giving Notre Dame a home site for the quarterfinals. With other teams still vying for a tournament appearance, the Irish needed a decent postseason run to remain above the cut line and they were faced with Michigan State in the first round. The Spartans, too, were competing for an at-large bid and whichever of the two lost the best-of-three series would be knocked out of contention. Ryan Bischel held off a strong MSU attack in the first game, earning a 1–0 victory for the Irish. The second game started much the same and Notre Dame had a 1-goal lead after the first period. In the second period, however, the wheels came off for the Irish as Michigan State scored 4 consecutive goals and evened the series at 1-all. In the deciding game, Notre Dame played as well as could be expected, outshooting MSU 39–28, going 2 for 4 on the power play and not taking a single penalty in the game. However, former Irish netminder, Dylan St. Cyr, came back to haunt his old team and stopped 37 shots to lead the Spartans to a 2–4 victory.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Winter league baseball is baseball contested in sports leagues during what is generally considered the baseball off-season.\nBackground.\nAnnually, the highest level of professional baseball competition, Major League Baseball (MLB), begins with spring training and runs through completion of the World Series in the fall. Winter league baseball takes place in the months between the completion of the World Series and the start of the next season's spring training. As this spans winter in the Northern Hemisphere, winter baseball leagues are located in warm-weather areas such as Central America and the Caribbean, or, less commonly, in the Southern Hemisphere such as in Australia. In Australia, Baseball Victoria holds its own winter league between April and September.\nWinter baseball provides an opportunity for prospects to build their skills or demonstrate their capabilities, or for established players to refine their skills or stay in shape. Many notable major-league players have played winter league baseball—during the 1954–55 winter season, the outfield of the Santurce Crabbers in Puerto Rico featured both Willie Mays and Roberto Clemente.\nLeagues.\nNotable professional baseball leagues operating as winter leagues include:\nActive.\nChampions of leagues based in and around the Caribbean meet annually in the Caribbean Series, normally contested in February."

        "text": "The Egypt–Greece–Saudi Arabia 2030 FIFA World Cup bid was a joint bid to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup by Egypt, Greece, and Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia was expected to lead the effort. Had it been successful, it would have been the first FIFA World Cup, men's or women's, to hosted in countries that are part of three different football federations (AFC, CAF and UEFA) on three continents: Asia, Africa and Europe and the first men's tournament to be held in more than one continental confederation.\nBackground.\nIn recent years, the three nations have developed strong political, economic, and military ties. The bid could have been the culmination of the alliance between the three nations, and was officially announced a few weeks before the start of the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. The three countries share extensive maritime borders: Egypt with Greece and Egypt with Saudi Arabia.\nBid withdrawal.\nIn a Sada El-Balad interview on April 8, 2023, Egypt's Minister of Youth and Sports Ashraf Sobhy stated that Egypt does not intend on submitting a bid for the 2030 World Cup., later, on June 23, 2023, the three nations announced they would not summit a bid to host the World Cup, citing the CAF's support for the Spain-Portugal-Morocco bid as a reason.\nPotential venues.\nFor the 2026 FIFA World Cup, it has been confirmed that stadiums must have a capacity of at least 40,000 for group round, second round, and quarter final matches, 60,000 for the semi-finals, and at least 80,000 for the Opening Match and Final. The rules for 2030 have not been announced.\nConcerns.\nMuch like the 2022 FIFA World Cup, if this bid had been selected, the tournament would most likely be moved to the winter due to the high summer temperatures of the location. There was also concern about Saudi Arabia using the tournament as part of a larger football sportswashing campaign, which has already seen the PIF take over Newcastle United, their hosting of the 2023 FIFA Club World Cup, and Cristiano Ronaldo being signed to Al Nassr FC in Riyadh. Saudi Arabia is also a member of the AFC, whose rotation would have prevented member countries from hosting World Cup until 2034. The Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis also came under fire from the opposition Syriza in 2023 after a rumored deal involving Saudi Arabia building new stadiums in both Greece and Egypt was revealed by Politico. There was also concern in Greece about paying for mega events and large sports infrastructure, as many still remember the 2004 Summer Olympics, which left many abandoned venues and was partially blamed for the country's debt crisis. Additionally, with FIFA cutting the Visit Saudi sponsorship deal in April 2023 for the Women's World Cup, there would have been issues with whether or not FIFA would be willing to support the bid."

        "text": "The 2022-23 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey season was the 74th season of play for the program and 22nd in the Big Ten. The Badgers represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. They were coached by Tony Granato in his seventh season and played their home games at Kohl Center.\nSeason.\nAfter an abysmal season, Wisconsin was hoping for a resurgence in 2023. Unfortunately for the Badgers, this season the Big Ten was the strongest conference in the nation, boasting upwards of 6 teams ranked in the top 20. Wisconsin was the odd man out and though they did see improvements on both the offensive and defensive side of the puck, it wasn't enough to keep them out of the conference cellar. From the start of the season the Badgers had to face a murderer's row of opponents and played their first 8 games against ranked teams. While they did win two of those games, both were against non-conference competition and only marginally helped the team's cause.\nWisconsin managed to put together a 5-game winning streak in the middle of the season but four of those victories came against two of the lowest-ranked teams in the country and the team followed that up by going 3–11 over the next fourteen games. It wasn't really until the end of the regular season that the Badgers showed any signs of life when they managed to split three consecutive series, all against ranked teams. While it didn't help they at all in regards to their playoff position, it did at least show that they had the potential to make waves in the conference tournament.\nIn the postseason meeting at Michigan, the Badger's offense show up and scored 9 goals in two games. However, the defense was porous and allowed the Wolverines to score 13 goals.\nShortly after the end of the season, head coach Tony Granato was relieved of his position. The move did not come as a surprise to Granato, who said:\n“Based on the end of last year, I knew we had to win this year,”\nIt was the fifth losing season for the Badgers under Granato in seven years.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2022–23 Stonehill Skyhawks men's ice hockey season was the 44th season of play for the program and 1st at the Division I level. The Skyhawks represented Stonehill College and were coached by David Borges in his 9th season.\nSeason.\nAfter the college announced that it was promoting all of its athletic programs to Division I for the 2022–23 academic season, the ice hockey program had just a scant few months to put a schedule together. While they were able to get a few D-I schools on their slate, the Skyhawks had to rely on Division II and III teams to fill out the majority of their schedule.\nDue to weather conditions, the game against Franklin Pierce that was originally scheduled for January 24 was postponed.\nOn February 1, the NCAA selection committee voted to remove all Stonehill games from consideration for the NCAA tournament selection. This was done primarily due to the low number of Division I games that the Skyhawks played this season. Because this was Stonehill's first season at the DI level, they were not eligible for postseason play so the ruling did not affect the program in any practical way.\nOver the course of the season, two things became apparent for the Skyhawks. First, with the influx on scholarship players, the team was now significantly better than their former contemporaries. Going 17–1–2 against Division II and III opponents showed that Stonehill no longer belonged at the lower levels. However, despite setting a new program record for wins and winning percentage, Stonehill was not yet up to snuff at the Division I level. Losing their first game of the year to Long Island was probably unavoidable but the team showed little progress as the season went on. Due in part to exclusively playing D-II and III opponents for almost 4 months, the Skyhawks didn't have the ability to gage themselves against stronger competition and improve their play over the course of the year. The defense, which performed well in most games, was woefully inadequate when facing other D-I teams. The games against Lindenwood are of particular note as the Lions too were in their first season of Division I play. However, with Lindenwood playing a full D-I schedule, they were able to improve their play far more than the Skyhawks.\nWith more lead time for their second Division I season, Stonehill should not have to rely so heavily on the lower levels to fill up their schedule.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | North Country Tournament"

In the boys' pairs competition, together with Vilém Šedivý, won the silver medal, lost to Keelan Kay and Brad Phillips from England in the final match.\nIn 2019, again together with Vilém Šedivý, won the silver medal in the pairs competition at the 2019 WDF Europe Cup Youth. They lost in the final match to Jurjen van der Velde and Luke van der Kwast from the Netherlands. In the team competition, the youth team from the Czech Republic slightly lost to the Netherlands and took bronze medal. The coronavirus pandemic has slowed down Houdek's career as he has maintained a regular game in his home country.\nIn 2022, he was invited to participate in a special tournament held during the 2022 WDF Europe Cup Youth. Due to the cancellation of tournaments in 2020–2021 because the COVID-19 pandemic, it was decided to organize an additional tournament (WDF Europe U21 Cup) for players under 21 years of age. In the boys' under-21 singles event, he won the gold medal, defeated David Zaruba in the final by 6–5 in legs. The excellent result of the Czech national team in other competitions contributed to the victory in the general classification. Ultimately, Houdek returned from this tournament with four gold medals.\nAt the end of September 2022, he was selected by the national federation to participate in the 2022 WDF Europe Cup. On the second day of the tournament, he advanced to the second round of the pairs competition where he played together with Dalibor Šmolík. They were defeated by James Hurrell and Luke Littler from England by 3–4 in legs. On the third day of the tournament, he lost in the preliminary round match to Stefan Bellmont by 3–4 in legs. In the team competition, Czech team advanced to the second round, where he lost to England by 7–9 in legs."

However, USA Swimming followed suit of the ongoing Court of Arbitration for Sport ban on Russian representation at World Championships between December 2020 and December 2022, for example Russian Andrey Minakov competed representing Alto Swim Club instead of his country. For the aforementioned ban time frame, FINA also did not count Russian times swam at any competitions, including national championships such as this one, towards world rankings nor world records."

        "title": "Church Street School swimming pool",
        "text": "The Church Street School swimming pool is a category C listed building in Glasgow, Scotland. It was built in 1904 as part of the redevelopment of the school by the local authority. The school closed in 1976 but the pool remained in use as a public facility until its closure in 1997. The building has remained unused since then, though the school now serves as offices for Glasgow City Council's health and social care team. The structure has fallen into disrepair and has been listed on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland since 1999. A redevelopment of the site is planned by the council.\nHistory.\nThe site formerly housed the private Partick Academy. School boards were established in Scotland under the Education (Scotland) Act 1872 to provide education to the general public. The Partick Academy moved to new premises from 1877 and the following year the site was purchased by the Govan Parish School Board for £3,000 (). The school had 683 pupils by the mid-1890s when it was decided to demolish the structure and erect one with a larger capacity. The new school was built in 1903, with separate entrances, stairwell and playgrounds for 1,308 boys and girls.\nThe swimming pool, designed like the main school by Donald Bruce and Edward A. B. Hay, was built in 1904. The school closed in 1976 but the swimming pool remained in operation as a public facility until 1997. The entire former school complex was scheduled for demolition but saved by a campaign by local residents which led to the granting of statutory protection as listed buildings for much of the complex. The swimming pool structure received category C listing by Historic Environment Scotland (HES) in 2002. A 2022 \"Glasgow Times\" article noted that \"the pool was one of the school's most unusual features: not many were built and still fewer survive\" and HES noted that it was \"a rare survival of its type\". The school has since become offices for Glasgow City Council's health and social care team, though the pool structure was left empty.\nThe structure has been on the Buildings at Risk Register for Scotland since 8 October 1999. Visits by inspectors were made in 2004, 2007 and 2014. Some of the non-listed buildings on the site have been demolished and the roof of a janitor's house, attached to the swimming pool, has been removed. The structure is noted by the register as being in poor condition and at high risk of damage. The structure has been entered by urban explorers.\nIn August 2022, local residents raised concerns that the structure might be demolished after noticing Glasgow City Council fencing and signage on the site. In October, the council confirmed they were planning a redevelopment of the site and could not rule out demolition. In December 2022, the council notified the Buildings at Risk Register of their intention to remove vegetation from the structure and carry out some stabilisation work.\nDescription.\nThe swimming pool is located at the western side of the southern boundary of the school site, a triangular plot bounded by Church Street to the east, the B808 to the west, and Torness Street to the south. The structure is long and almost rectangular in plan, with the western elevation skewed to conform to the adjacent B808 road. The pool building is two storeys in height and incorporates a gymnasium. The façade of the structure runs along the back of the footway on Torness Street and for much of the western elevation, where it has a very small front yard at the south-west.\nThe structure is built from roughly dressed red sandstone ashlars laid in a snecked pattern, though the corners are formed from smoothly dressed ashlars. A pulvinated course runs at the top of the eaves, which are bracketed. On the west elevation a corniced stringcourse runs at the level of the top of the first floor. The roof features a raised rooflight along the entire ridgeline. The 2-storey janitor's house is attached to the north side of the structure on the western elevation.\nFew windows remain intact and buddleia is growing within the structure. The walls are damp and mossy and the structure is partly supported by scaffolding. The interior features wrought iron decoration including ornate bannisters to the first floor viewing area, original tiles and clock."

        "text": "The 2023 FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League was the fifth edition of the FIVB Volleyball Men's Nations League, an annual men's international volleyball tournament. The competition was held from 6 June to 23 July 2023, and the final round took place in Ergo Arena, Gdańsk, Poland. Following the results of 2022 Nations League and 2022 Challenger Cup, Australia were replaced by debutants Cuba in this edition. Finals host and home team Poland won their first VNL title after defeating United States in four sets. It was the United States' third silver medal. Japan deafeated Italy in a tie-breaker match and claimed the bronze medal. Paweł Zatorski from Poland named the MVP of the tournament.\nQualification.\nSixteen teams qualified for the competition. Ten of them qualified as core teams which cannot face relegation. Other six teams were selected as challenger teams which could be relegated from the tournament. Cuba replaced Australia after winning the 2022 Challenger Cup.\nFormat.\nPreliminary round.\nThe format of play is the same as edition 2022. The new format will see 16 men's teams competing in pools of 8 teams during the pool phase. Each team plays 12 matches during the pool stage. Eight teams will then move into the final knockout phase of the competition.\nFinal round.\nThe VNL Finals will see the top eight teams moving directly to the knockout phase which will consist of eight matches in total: four quarterfinals, two semi-finals and the bronze and gold medal matches.\nFinal 8 direct elimination formula:\nPool composition.\nThe overview of pools was released on 11 November 2022.\nPreliminary round.\nRanking.\n&lt;section begin=\"2023 VNL prelims\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"2023 VNL prelims\" /&gt;\nFinal round.\n&lt;section begin=\"2023 VNL F8\" /&gt;&lt;section end=\"2023 VNL F8\" /&gt;\nControversies.\nIran team's visa issues in the United States.\nAfter the announcement of the host venues and the games schedule, the president of the Iranian Volleyball Federation sent a letter to the FIVB expressing their concerns about the fact that the Iranian team is scheduled to play their games on the third week of the VNL in the USA territory. They stated that five members of the Iranian national team required further examination and additional documentation for visa issuance. The Iranian authorities also expressed their desire to host the USA's leg instead, or they might boycott the leg by not sending anyone to the USA.\nThe passports of the Iranian national team members were resubmitted to the US Embassy in Ankara, Turkey for a visa issuance. After necessary checks, visas were issued for the 12 players, with only four days left until the start of Week 3 of the VNL. However, five players including Amin Esmaeilnezhad were not granted visas. This situation also happened with the coach of the Iranian national team, Behrouz Ataei, who presented an incomplete documentation. After the second week round in Rotterdam, Netherlands, the rejected five players had to return to Tehran.\nAfter failed negotiations with the American authorities, the FIVB Executive Committee specifically examined the question of the visas for the Iranian team and approved an unprecedented decision. If the United States government does not issue the visas to the key members of the Iranian team, the points of Iran and its opponents in the third week of the games would not be accounted for on the world rankings, but the results of these games would count exclusively for the tournament."

        "title": "Para surfing",
        "text": "Para surfing or adaptive surfing is a form of surfing in which a disabled individual uses a board or waveski to ride on a breaking wave. Competitively, the International Surfing Association (ISA) has hosted the World Para Surfing Championships annually since 2015. In addition, the Association of Adaptive Surfing Professionals (AASP) was formed in 2022 as the international governing body of professional adaptive surfing, and administers the AASP World Tour including events in Hawaii and California for its inaugural year. The Para Surf League (PSL), launched in 2022, organizes amateur and professional contests worldwide.\nAdaptive surfers are classified into different competitive divisions based on their respective disabilities, with classification generally certified by medical professionals for professional competitions. There are currently nine separate divisions recognized by the ISA, AASP, and PSL.\nHistory.\nThe first adaptive surfing organization, Life Rolls On, was created in 2001 by Jesse Billauer, an aspiring professional surfer who sustained a spinal cord injury in 1996. The organization holds multiple \"They Will Surf Again\" events each year to help disabled individuals learn adaptive surfing.\nIn 2006, Duke's Oceanfest with the help of AccesSurf Hawaii added an adaptive surfing heat as part of its competition. Since 2007 the Hawaii ASC has been held annually sustaining the platform of adaptive surfing and raising it to a professional level.\nIn 2015, the ISA hosted the first World Para Surfing Championships (originally called the World Adaptive Surfing Championships). The inaugural event included 69 competitors from 18 nations. Most recently, the 2022 event featured 181 athletes from 28 nations.\nIn 2017 the U.S. Open Adaptive Surfing Championships was born as the first professional adaptive surfing championship to offer a cash prize pool purse for all podium winners and was also the first to implement priority judging. The U.S. Open ASC was born following the standard set by AccesSurf and the Hawaii ASC as a professional platform.\nIn September of 2019 and March of 2020, para surfers underwent reorganization into more balanced sport categories, which took into account factors like their underlying health conditions, eligible impairments, and specific impairment criteria. Additionally, a conceptual framework was established to provide guidance for classification decisions and to lay the groundwork for future research in this field.\nIn 2022, the Association of Adaptive Surfing Professionals was formed to be the international governing body of professional adaptive surfing, and to organize a tour of events for adaptive surfing professionals. In its inaugural year, the tour hosted 2 events, the Hawaii Adaptive Surfing Championships, and the US Open Adaptive Surfing Championships. Surfers were allotted points based on results in each contest, and those with the highest point totals were crowned world tour champions and were able to award over $100,000 dollars to adaptive athletes in its first year.\nThe Para Surf League launched in 2022 to organize Para Surfing competitions around the world. The Para Surf League Series will be organizing events in Costa Rica, Spain, Wales, France and more.\nClassification.\nIn 2018 Dr. Maureen Johnson PhD,MS,OT/L,BCPR,C/NDT, Stoke for Life Foundation and the U.S. Open Adaptive Surfing Championships developed and copy wrote the current classification system being used by the AASP, PSL, and ISA. The ISA adopted the classification system in 2020. The ISA, AASP, and PSL each recognize the same nine divisions of adaptive surfing.\nEvents.\nISA.\nThe ISA Para Surfing World Championships hosts Olympic style surfing competitions. The competitions began in 2015 and were hosted on Prismo beach, but are now being hosted on Huntington Beach since 2023. The competition has a round-robin format where each surfer gets to compete twice. The surfers are ranked according to the total of their best two waves from either heat.\nIn the vision impairment division of the ISA Para Surfing Championship Matt Formston, of Australia, is the champion of years 2017, 2018, and 2020.\n2021 was the first time that the ISA Para Surfing World Championships were held outside of the San Diego area.\nIn 2023 a record was set for the event with 183 competitors competing in the event for 27 different countries.\nAASP.\nThe Hawaii Adaptive Surfing Championships take place annually in Waikiki. Produced by local nonprofit AccesSurf, the competition grew from an event held as part of Duke's Oceanfest in 2006, since 2007 the Hawaii ASC has been held annually sustaining the platform of adaptive surfing and raising it to a professional level. They became a standalone event in 2019 breaking away from Dukes Ocean Festival.\nIn 2023, the Adaptive Surfing Open Pro Costa Rica will be held at Boca Barranca in Puntarenas.\nThe U.S. Open of Adaptive Surfing Championships are held annually in Oceanside, California, produced by local non profit Stoke for Life Foundation and is the last of three events on the AASP World Tour. They were first held in 2017.\nPSL.\nThe first Para Surf League contest of 2023 will be the SA Para Surf League Open, at Muizenberg Beach in Cape Town, South Africa.\nThe Para Surf League and USA Surfing will hold the United States National Championships in Oceanside, CA. US Citizens competing in this contest will be eligible for selection to the USA Surfing National Para Surf team.\nThe Para Surf League Open Costa Rica will take place at Playa Jaco, Garabito, Puntarenas as the third stop of the Para Surf League Series in 2023.\nThe European leg of the PSL will have contests in Spain, Wales, and France with the 2023 Para Surf League Open España\n2023 Para Surf League Open España, the 2023 Welsh Para Surf Champs and Para Surf League Open, and the 2023 OPEN DE FRANCE #2 et Open de la Para Surf League Euro Cont. Champs.\nOther.\nThe 2022 English Adaptive Surfing Open ran at The Wave in Bristol, England.\nParalympics.\nPara surfing was one of 33 sports, including ten new sports, with submitted applications to the International Paralympic Committee for inclusion into the LA28 Paralympic Games. The IPC has put Para Surfing on the short list of sports for further consideration for inclusion, and a final decision for inclusion will be made by the end of 2023."

        "text": "Todd A. Jones (born July 3, 1967) is a former American football offensive tackle who played in the National Football League (NFL) for the Cleveland Browns, Dallas Cowboys, New England Patriots, and Denver Broncos. He also played in the World League of American Football (WLAF) with the Orlando Thunder and the Canadian Football League (CFL) with the Memphis Mad Dogs. He played college football at Arkansas and Henderson State.\nJones was drafted by the Browns in the eleventh round of the 1991 NFL Draft, but never played in a regular season game for the team. He was also on the Dallas Cowboys' roster during their Super Bowl XXVII victory, though he was on the physically unable to perform list. He played in four regular season games during his career, all in 1993 with the Patriots.\nEarly life.\nTodd Jones was born July 3, 1967, in the city of Hope, Arkansas, located in the southwestern part of the state. By his teen years, he had moved to the state's capital of Little Rock.\nJones played high school football for the Little Rock Central Tigers, where he was a star his senior year. Beyond being named team captain and top offensive lineman at the school, he also earned all-conference, all-metro, all-state, and all-American honors en route to an 11–2 record that placed the Tigers in third place in the state of Arkansas.\nCollege football career.\nArkansas Razorbacks.\nJones started playing college football in 1986 at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, but only saw action in the first three games before going down for the rest of the season with a knee injury.\nDuring his sophomore season at Arkansas in 1987, Jones was a backup at tackle to Jim Mabry in the Razorbacks' wishbone formation. The following season in 1988, the two alternated as the starting tackle in an \"option attack\" offense.\nHenderson State Reddies.\nAfter two seasons at Arkansas, Jones decided to transfer to Henderson State University in Arkadelphia in 1989. After sitting out the 1989 season, he played the 1990 season and made NAIA first-team All-American.\nProfessional football career.\nJones did not attend the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, but was able to bench 225 pounds 44 times without stopping, which would have been the highest at the combine.\nCleveland Browns (NFL).\nOn April 22, 1991, the Cleveland Browns selected Jones in the eleventh round of the 1991 NFL Draft after having been described by the team's personnel department as \"exceptionally strong, quick, and aggressive.\" However, the team cut him on August 8 of that year.\nOrlando Thunder (WLAF).\nIn the spring of 1992, Jones joined the Orlando Thunder of the World League of American Football, a spring developmental league created by the NFL that later became known as NFL Europe. Jones played offensive guard in all ten of the team's games that season on an offensive line that allowed only ten sacks in the whole season.\nThe Thunder finished 8–2 and progressed to World Bowl '92, which they lost to the Sacramento Surge by a score of 21–17.\nDallas Cowboys (NFL).\nFollowing his performance in the WLAF, Jones signed a one-year deal with the Dallas Cowboys on June 10, 1992. Due to a left knee injury, he was put on the physically unable to perform list on July 17, 1992, where he remained for the entire 1992 season as the team went on to win Super Bowl XXVII.\nDespite not having been available for the whole previous season, Jones was signed again by the Cowboys on May 27, 1993. He was waived by the team on August 30 of that year.\nNew England Patriots (NFL).\nOn August 31, 1993, the day after being waived by the Cowboys, Jones was claimed by the New England Patriots. He played four games that season as a backup center before being released by the team on December 13, 1993.\nDenver Broncos (NFL).\nThe Denver Broncos signed Jones on August 9, 1994, but cut him only nine days later.\nMemphis Mad Dogs (CFL).\nAfter four years of playing as a journeyman in the NFL, Jones signed with the Memphis Mad Dogs of the Canadian Football League. This was at the tail end of a failed experiment by the CFL to expand the league into the United States, and the Mad Dogs only existed for one season in 1995.\nJones played in 17 of the Mad Dogs' 18 games that season, primarily at left guard.\nPersonal life.\nJones married Valerie Sims in college, with whom he has a daughter named Gabriel (born 1989)."

        "title": "2022–23 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2022–23 Minnesota Golden Gophers men's ice hockey season was the 102nd season of play for the program and 33rd in the Big Ten. The Golden Gophers represented the University of Minnesota in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, were coached by Bob Motzko in his fifth season, and played their home games at 3M Arena at Mariucci\nSeason.\nTalented recruits.\nMinnesota lost several key players from their Frozen Four team of '22, however, coach Motzko brought in a highly regarded batch of freshmen as replacements. Of the eleven newcomers, six had been selected in the NHL Entry Draft, two were first-round selection with the biggest prospect being #3 overall pick Logan Cooley. Cooley centered a line with fellow first-rounder Jimmy Snuggerud and US Olympian Matthew Knies that turned into one of the top offensive units in the nation. On the defensive side, to a corps that already included top prospects Ryan Johnson, Brock Faber and Jackson LaCombe, Minnesota added a trio of talented blueliners. Coach Motzko would call the collection of seven players the 'Best I’ve ever had and will ever have'. On top of that, Minnesota also retained Justen Close in goal who had finished the year as the team's starter and produced stellar numbers as the most critical juncture of the team's season.\nSorting out.\nWith all that going for the Gophers, Minnesota was ranked #2 in the preseason polls, only behind defending National Champion Denver. The Gophers began well enough, winning their first three games, but they also went through a gauntlet of teams during the first month and a half of the season. Minnesota was only able to earn a split in three consecutive weekends but, because all of their opponents were ranked, the Gophers were still #3 by the beginning of November. Even after beginning their conference schedule, Minnesota continued to face very stiff opposition. However, by then the team was beginning to grow accustomed to one another and the Gophers won three out of four to start the month.\nJust before Thanksgiving, Minnesota was set to face off against Michigan in a battle between top 3 teams. In what could possibly determine the conference champion, the high-anticipated matchup was derailed when an Adenovirus outbreak swept through both locker rooms. While Minnesota was without the services of Aaron Huglen and Justen Close, Michigan was much harder hit as several players, including star forward Adam Fantilli were ruled out while one, Steven Holtz, was so severely affected by the illness that he was placed on a ventilator and nearly died. Unsurprisingly, the Wolverines' hearts were not in the game and Minnesota managed to sweep the series.\nSlow climb to the top.\nAfter Thanksgiving, Minnesota took a break from its conference slate and travelled down to Tempe to take on Arizona State. While the team seemed to have recovered from their viral issues, they seemed a bit off in the series and were only able to manage a split. The loss dropped Minnesota down to #4 which, while hardly a bad thing, was not up to par for a team that had pretentions for a National Championship. The team responded with four convincing wins to finish out the first half of the season and sat squarely at the top of the Big Ten standings.\nOnce the Gophers returned from the winter break, they had one final chance to prove their non-conference mettle against St. Cloud State. Unfortunately, the team's offense still appeared to be on vacation and was only able to score twice in the series. Fortunately, that was enough to earn a split and keep Minnesota at #3. A couple weeks later, the Gophers got their rematch with Michigan, who by then was completely recovered from the health scare. The two teams fought hard in the series and proved to be the equal of the other as both games went into overtime with each earning one win.\nMinnesota regained their spot at #1 at the beginning of February after sweeping their season series over Michigan State, however, the Gophers dropped back down to #2 when a down Wisconsin team was able to eek out a 1–3 win. Minnesota was back on top of the polls a week later after taking down a sliding Penn State and finished the regular season as the top team in all three rankings.\nConference tournament.\nAs the #1 team in the Big Ten, Minnesota received a bye into the semifinals. The team was able to sit at home and practice while they awaited the lowest-seeded survivor of the quarterfinal round. Michigan State ended up arriving in Minneapolis a week later and the time off seemed have negatively affected the Gophers as the team surrendered the first goal to the Spartans on the power play. After that, however, Minnesota took over the game and scored the next 5 markers to skate to a comfortable victory.\nMinnesota hosted Michigan for the championship. While both teams were already guaranteed a spot in the NCAA tournament, Minnesota had already secured the top overall seed regardless of the game's outcome. With both teams playing for pride, the game was a seesaw affair that saw both clubs skating up and down the ice. The Gophers scored first but the two then exchanged leads three times with Michigan finishing out ahead by a narrow 3–4 score.\nNCAA tournament.\nThough the loss in the conference championship was disappointing, Minnesota still had a chance to achieve their ultimate goal; winning the program's first national championship in 20 years. Minnesota began their tournament run in the best possible position. Not only was the team close to home at the Fargo regional, but they were set against Canisius in the first round. While the Golden Griffins were one of the final 16 teams, their national ranking was in the 40s. However, even with all of those advantages, Minnesota got off to a slow start. While the Gophers were able to get the first goal of the game on the power play, sloppy play afterwards enabled Canisius to tie the score less than three minutes later. The subpar performance continued into the second and Nick Bowman gave the Griffins their first lead of the match after just three minutes. While Minnesota was hardly in danger at the time, with more than half of the game left to play, the now-trailing team began to clean its play up and demonstrate that it was the superior club. Minnesota scored twice before the end of the second to regain the lead but Canisius was not going down without a fight. Despite being vastly outgunned, the Griffins were just one shot away from tying the game and had 20 minutes to work with. Luckily for Minnesota, Stefano Bottini got a bit overexcited at the start of the third and took a match penalty just 27 seconds into the period. Minnesota scored twice on the ensuing major penalty and opened the floodgates. With Canisius having to abandon its defensive effort to throw everything at Justen Close, Minnesota had a much easier time scoring and posted seven goals in the third period, turning what had once been a nail-biter into a runaway victory.\nWith a trip to Tampa on the line, Minnesota had to get past NCHC champion, St. Cloud State. After the slow start in the previous game, Minnesota made sure they didn't have a repeat and outshot the Huskies 14–6 in the first period. While they only managed to score once, the Gophers still held the lead going into the middle frame. St. Cloud tied the score on the power play but Minnesota regained the lead a few minutes later and never relinquished that advantage. Minnesota's fast and physical defensive corps stopped the rest of the Huskies' opportunities and carried the Gophers to a 4–1 win.\nIn the program's second consecutive trip to the Frozen Four, the Gophers took on Boston University for the fifth meeting between the two in the National Semifinal. With the historical record sitting at 2–2, the Terriers got off to a good start, scoring the first goal around the midway point of the first. After that, however, BU got into penalty trouble and Minnesota made them pay; the Gophers scored twice on the man advantage to take the lead before the start of the second. The Terriers got their own power play goal in the second to tie the game but Luke Mittelstadt scored twice in the first four minutes of the third to put Minnesota ahead for good. A pair of empty netters at the end extended their lead and ensured that Minnesota reached the championship game for the first time in 9 years.\nNational Championship.\nWith just Quinnipiac left in their way, Minnesota was hoping to be the first #1 seed to win the championship since Denver in 2017. The Gophers began with a defensive front and counterpunched. While that may have played into Quinnipiac's hands, as the Bobcats were the top defensive team in the country, a fanned clearing attempt was intercepted by Connor Kurth and, after drawing Yaniv Perets out of position, he slipped the puck in front of the cage where John Mittelstadt knocked in his fourth of the season for the game's first goal less than six minutes into the game. The defensive struggle resumed afterwards and neither team got much in the way of scoring opportunities for the rest of the period.\nEarly in the second, after a faceoff win in the Bobcat's end, Brock Faber purposefully fired the puck from the blueline wide. The rubber bounced off of the end wall right to Jaxon Nelson who chipped the puck into the top corner of the net for a 2–0 lead. At this point, Minnesota was in full control of the game and it appeared that the Gophers were going to glide to the program's 6th National Championship. However, while Quinnipiac was the #1 defense, they also possessed the #3 offense and the Bobcats began leaning a bit more on the gas and were finally able to solve Justen Close a few minutes later. Minnesota pulled back and played defense for most of the rest of the game, trying to win with their 2–1 lead.\nWhile they were widely outshot in the final half of the game, Minnesota did get several opportunities to extend their lead but bouncing and rolling pucks ended up causing all chances to miss. With about five minutes to play, Logan Cooley got into a scuffle with one of the Bobcats. While one referee signaled that he would give matching minors to both players if they continued, the other had already called Cooley for a high-sticking penalty. The Minnesota faithful were up in arms about the controversial call but the Gophers still had to slow down a strong Quinnipiac power play. The Bobcats ended up getting several good look at the net but Minnesota was able to stop everything, allowing Cooley to return to the ice. Unfortunately, just as he was getting into the play, Collin Graf fired a low shot on goal that sneaked between the legs of Close and bounced into the net. Suddenly, Minnesota found itself having to restart its offense but the Gophers seemed able to get back on their horses. Almost immediately after the ensuing faceoff, Minnesota broke in on the Bobcats' goal and had a chance to regain their lead but a strong defensive effort stopped the Gopher attack. The two teams continued to test one another for the remainder of the period but ended up needing overtime to decide the game.\nJaxon Nelson won the opening draw of the 4th period but did so too strongly and the puck ended up sailing into the Quinnipiac bench. On the ensuing draw, also at center ice, the Bobcats took control of the puck and, using a set play, engineered a quick 2-on-1 that resulted in the winning goal by Jacob Quillan. While the Bobcats celebrated, Minnesota desperately hoped that the play was offsides. When those faint hopes were dashed, the team could only watch as the championship, which had been within their grasp only minutes before, was captured by another team.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Shooting competitions were confirmed for the 2026 Commonwealth Games programme, that was to be held in Victoria, Australia. In July 2023, Victoria announced it had cancelled its plans to host the games citing an escalation in its cost projections relative to initial estimations. The Games were scheduled to take place from the 17 to 29 March 2026. As of July 2023, the Commonwealth Games Federation were seeking a new host.\nBackground.\nIn July 2022, the organising committee for the 2026 Commonwealth Games released the sporting programme for the games. Like Birmingham 2022 it did not include shooting. Following the controversy surrounding the exclusion of Shooting at Birmingham, India expressed strong disappointment and raised the matter during the Birmingham Games with visiting organisers from Victoria.\nIn August 2022 the Expression of Interest (EOI) period for additional sports opened and Shooting Australia announced that the ISSF had submitted a proposal for shooting. Like the proposals for the 2022 Games, the programme was heavily restricted. The proposal included just four disciplines - Trap, Air Rifle, Air Pistol and Fullbore Rifle. This dropped cartridge pistol, 50m rifle, and skeet. Para-Shooting events were also included in the bid, though it was not specified whether these were limited to airgun disciplines or included Para-Trap, which had demonstrated at the 2017 CSF(ED) Championships in Wales.\nIn October 2022, the inclusion of Shooting was confirmed, but without Fullbore Rifle. It was later announced that Shooting would be held in the Gippsland region, east of Melbourne. The proposal had originally been based in Greater Bendigo, north of Melbourne. This was to use the Wellsford Fullbore Rifle Range (which also hosted the 2006 Commonwealth Games fullbore events). With the exclusion of Fullbore Rifle, the events were no longer tied to the Bendigo area.\nExternal links.\nCommonwealth Games Federation - Victoria 2026"

        "text": "The UEFA Women's Nations League is a biennial international women's football competition contested by the senior women's national teams of the member associations of UEFA, the sport's European governing body.\nThe competition feature threes leagues, with promotion and relegation between them in addition to a final tournament to determine the champions. It also acts as part of the qualifying process for the UEFA Women's Championship, FIFA Women's World Cup and Women's Olympic Football Tournament, depending on the season.\nHistory.\nOn 2 November 2022, the UEFA Executive Committee approved a new women's national team competition system, which was publicly announced the following day. This included the announcement of a women's Nations League competition beginning in 2023. The new system came as part of the UEFA women's football strategy for 2019 to 2024 and was approved after discussions between representatives of national associations and the recommendation of the UEFA Women's Football Committee. The Women's Nations League acts as the first phase of a two-part women's national team competition cycle, with the other phase being the European qualifiers for the UEFA Women's Championship or FIFA Women's World Cup.\nThe new system is designed to create more competitive matches, with teams facing others of similar strength, while generating a greater sporting and commercial interest in women's national team football. However, the system still gives all national teams a chance of qualifying for major international tournaments. The interconnected competition cycles are intended to encourage the long-term development of women's national teams.\nFormat.\nThe competition begins with the league stage, featuring the national teams split into three leagues (A, B, and C). Leagues A and B both consist of 16 teams in 4 groups of 4, while League C consist ofs the remaining competition entrants split into groups of three or four. The teams in each group play against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The four group winners of League A advance to the Nations League Finals, organized by the participating teams, which feature single-leg semi-finals, a third-place play-off, and a final. In Summer Olympic years, the Nations League Finals determine the teams that will qualify for the Women's Olympic Football Tournament.\nIn addition, the competition features promotion and relegation, which takes effect in the next edition of qualification for the UEFA Women's Championship or FIFA Women's World Cup (both of which have an identical league structure). The group winners of Leagues B and C are automatically promoted, while the fourth-placed teams in Leagues A and B, as well as the lowest-ranked third-placed team in League B (conditional upon the number of entrants), are automatically relegated. Promotion/relegation matches are also held on a home-and-away basis, taking place in parallel with the Nations League Finals, with the winners going into the higher league and the losers going into the lower league. The third-placed teams of League A will play the runners-up of League B, while the three best-ranked third-placed teams in League B will play the three best-ranked League C runners-up (conditional upon the number of entrants), with the team from the higher league hosting the second leg.\nLink with European qualifiers.\nThe Women's Nations League is linked with qualification for the UEFA Women's Championship and FIFA Women's World Cup. The qualifiers for both competitions use the same league stage system as the Women's Nations League, with teams split into Leagues A, B, and C. Teams in qualification are split into leagues based on the results of the prior edition of the Women's Nations League. The results of the qualification league stage determine which teams qualify automatically for the Women's Euro or World Cup, and which teams enter the play-offs. In addition, teams are automatically promoted and relegated using the same format as in the Women's Nations League, though no promotion/relegation matches take place. This determines the league composition for the next edition of the Women's Nations League.\nTeam performances.\nThis table shows the overall performance of each team per Nations League season, including the intervening Euro or World Cup qualifying competitions which use an identical league structure, and teams' promotion/relegation between the leagues.\nKey:"

        "text": "The 2023–24 UEFA Women's Nations League was the inaugural season of the UEFA Women's Nations League, an international women's football competition contested by the senior women's national teams of the member associations of UEFA. The league phase of the competition was played between September and December 2023, with the finals tournament taking place in February 2024. The results also determined the leagues for the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 qualifying competition, and which two teams (in addition to hosts France) qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.\nFormat.\nThe competition began with the league stage, featuring the national teams split into three leagues (A, B, and C) based on their UEFA Women's national team coefficient. Leagues A and B featured 16 teams in four groups of four teams, while League C consisted of the remaining competition entrants split into groups of three or four teams.\nThe teams in each group played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The four group winners of League A advanced to the Nations League Finals, which featured single-leg semi-finals, a third-place play-off, and final. An open draw determined the pairings and home teams for the semi-final matches, as well as which semi-final will have its teams host the third-place play-off and final. The two best-ranked teams in the Nations League Finals (excluding France) qualified for the 2024 Summer Olympics.\nIn addition, the competition featured promotion and relegation, taking effect in UEFA Women's Euro 2025 qualifying (which uses an identical league structure). The group winners of Leagues B and C were automatically promoted, while the fourth-placed teams in Leagues A and B, as well as the lowest-ranked third-placed team in League B, were automatically relegated. Promotion/relegation matches were also held on a home-and-away basis, taking place in parallel with the Nations League Finals, to determine which teams would promoted, relegated or remain in their respective leagues. The third-placed teams of League A played the runners-up of League B, while the three best-ranked third-placed teams in League B played the three best-ranked League C runners-up. The teams from the higher leagues were seeded, and played the second leg at home. In the two-legged ties, the team that scored more goals on aggregate was the winner. If the aggregate score was level, extra time was played (the away goals rule was not applied). If the score remained level after extra time, a penalty shoot-out was used to decide the winner.\nTiebreakers for group ranking.\nIf two or more teams in the same group are equal on points on completion of the league phase, the following tie-breaking criteria are applied:\nNotes\nCriteria for league ranking.\nIndividual league rankings are established according to the following criteria:\nTo rank teams in League C, which may be composed of different-sized groups, the results against the fourth-placed teams in these leagues are not taken into account to compare teams placed first, second, and third in their respective groups.\nThe ranking of the top four teams in League A is determined by their finish in the Nations League Finals.\nCriteria for overall ranking.\nThe overall UEFA Nations League rankings are established as follows:\nSchedule.\nThe competition was played from September 2023 to February 2024. It began with the league phase and ended with the Nations League Finals and promotion/relegation matches played in parallel. Below is the schedule of the 2023–24 UEFA Women's Nations League.\nSeeding.\nAll 55 UEFA national teams were able to submit an entry for the competition by 23 March 2023 at the latest, which also acted as entry for UEFA Women's Euro 2025 qualifying. In total, 51 teams entered the competition. Russia were not permitted to enter the competition, as Russian teams were suspended indefinitely from UEFA and FIFA competitions since 28 February 2022 due to their country's invasion of Ukraine. \nIn addition, Gibraltar, Liechtenstein and San Marino did not submit an entry, which meant that they could not qualify for UEFA Women's Euro 2025.\nThe draw for the league phase took place on 2 May 2023, 13:00 CEST, at the House of European Football in Nyon, Switzerland. Teams were split into leagues based on their UEFA Women's national team coefficient ranking. Teams were divided into four pots of four in Leagues A and B, and three pots of five and one pot of 4 in League C. For political reasons, Armenia and Azerbaijan (due to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict), as well as Belarus and Ukraine (due to the Belarusian involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine), could not be drawn in the same group. Due to winter venue restrictions, a group could contain a maximum of two of Sweden, Norway, and Iceland in League A, and two of Estonia, the Faroe Islands, Latvia, and Lithuania in League C. Due to excessive travel restrictions, only one of Andorra, the Faroe Islands, and Malta could be drawn with Kazakhstan.\nLeague A.\nNations League Finals.\nThe pairings and home teams were determined via an open draw on 11 December 2023.\nLeague C.\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nDue to differing group sizes in League C, results against fourth-placed teams were disregarded when ranking second-placed teams.\nPromotion/relegation matches.\nThe pairings for the promotion/relegation matches were determined using a draw on 11 December 2023.\nOverall ranking.\nThe results of each team's league rankings were used to calculate the overall ranking of the competition, using the ranking criteria, and were used for seeding in the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 qualifying draw."

        "title": "2011 Major League Baseball wild card chase",
        "text": "The 2011 Major League Baseball wild card chase was a playoff chase involving the Atlanta Braves and St. Louis Cardinals in the National League and the Boston Red Sox and Tampa Bay Rays in the American League.\nOn the last day of the 2011 regular season, the postseason fate of these four teams fighting for two playoff spots across both leagues was decided. In the National League, the St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Houston Astros to win the National League wild card berth after the Atlanta Braves lost to the Philadelphia Phillies. In the American League, the Tampa Bay Rays defeated their American League East division rivals the New York Yankees with dramatic home runs in the 9th inning by Dan Johnson and later in extra innings by Evan Longoria to win the American League wild card berth after the Baltimore Orioles defeated the Boston Red Sox on a walk-off single.\nOn September 2, the Red Sox and Braves had led the American League and National League wild card races by 9 and games, respectively. In their final 25 games, the Red Sox went 7–18 while the Braves went 8–17; in the same timespan, the Rays and Cardinals each won 17 games to secure the wild cards. The Red Sox and Braves became the first teams in history to hold leads as large as eight games in September and miss the postseason. The Cardinals eventually rode the momentum of their win to win the NLDS and NLCS on their way to defeating the Texas Rangers for their 11th World Series title.\nThe 2011 season was the final season of the single wild card format, as MLB added second wild card teams to each league starting with the 2012 season.\nBackground.\nThe Rays and Cardinals both overcame deficits of over eight games in the standings on September 2 to tie the Red Sox and Braves, respectively, on September 28.\nAmerican League Wild Card race.\nBoston Red Sox at Baltimore Orioles.\nWednesday, September 28, 2011 – 7:05 pm (EDT) at Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, Maryland\nThe Red Sox were favored by pundits to win the American League pennant prior to the start of the season due to acquisitions of Adrián González, Carl Crawford and Bobby Jenks. Despite a slow start, Boston darted to the top of the division during the summer months. Injuries plagued the team and they slowly lost first place to the Yankees, but were still in comfortable contention for the wild card. The month of September started an epic slump for the team where the team had allowed the Rays to get back into contention. However, Boston still controlled its own destiny going into their final series with the last place Orioles, but wound up having the season come down to the last game.\nThe Red Sox had taken a lead for a good part of the game, but the Orioles mounted a comeback. The game was interrupted by a rain delay in the middle of the 7th with Boston ahead 3–2. After play had resumed almost an hour and a half later, the Orioles still trailed by a run in the bottom of the 9th. When leading after eight innings, the Red Sox were 77–0 in 2011. Facing closer Jonathan Papelbon, Chris Davis and Nolan Reimold hit back-to-back doubles with two outs, which tied the game. The next batter, Robert Andino, hit a line drive to left field which Carl Crawford was unable to catch, allowing Reimold to score and the Orioles walked off with the win.\nAfter the Orioles won, Andino, who had been a Red Sox killer of late, said, \"End of season like this, to make Boston go home sad, crying, I'll take it all day.\"\nNew York Yankees at Tampa Bay Rays.\nWednesday, September 28, 2011 – 7:10 pm (EDT) at Tropicana Field in St. Petersburg, Florida\nThe Yankees had already won the American League East several days prior to this contest. The Rays had been in third place behind both the Yankees and the Red Sox for much of the season. However, Boston had slowly started to lose many games in September due to poor starting and relief pitching, disappointing hitting from newly acquired free agent Carl Crawford throughout the year, and injuries to key players like Kevin Youkilis. The Rays, who had won the division in 2010, had lost many of their players to free agency. Despite the losses, the Rays had crawled back into contention and faced the Yankees in the final series of the year.\nYankees manager Joe Girardi indicated that he would approach the final games so that the team's pitching staff would be set up for the 2011 ALDS against the Detroit Tigers. Suspicions rose to whether or not the Yankees would compete intensely due to them wanting to rest their aging players for the playoffs and to keep the Red Sox out, their fierce rivals whom they had a lopsided losing record to that season. Girardi indicated that many of his post-season pitchers would not be pitching that game. The Yankees, however, started the game strong by taking a 5–0 lead by the 2nd inning. Their lead grew to 7–0, which they held as the game entered the bottom of the 8th inning. In the 8th inning, the Rays scored six runs, capped off by a three-run home run by Evan Longoria. In the bottom of the 9th inning, down to his final strike, struggling Rays first baseman Dan Johnson hit a solo home run near the right field foul pole to tie the game. Already depleted from wanting to get pitchers who were not going to be on the postseason roster in, the Yankees went into extra innings with struggling pitchers. During Tampa Bay's half of the 12th inning, Evan Longoria hit his second home run of the game, a walk-off home run that cleared a short wall near the left field foul pole to win the game for the Rays just minutes after the Orioles' victory over the Red Sox. The win clinched the American League Wild Card for the Rays.\nSeat No. 10 in the first row behind the right-field foul pole has been painted white in honor of Dan Johnson's, game-tying, ninth-inning, pinch-hit blast during Game 162. They have also renamed the section beyond the left field foul pole \"162 Landing\" in honor of Longoria's game winning, 12th-inning home run.\nNational League Wild Card race.\nThe National League wild-card race came down to the fate of two games on the last day of the regular season.\nSt. Louis Cardinals at Houston Astros.\nWednesday, September 28, 2011 – 7:05 pm (CDT) at Minute Maid Park in Houston, Texas\nThe National League Central had been a two-way race late into the season with the Cardinals and Milwaukee Brewers vying for contention. After the Reds had fallen off, the Brewers had clinched the division. The Cardinals battled back despite perennial all-star Albert Pujols serving on the disabled list and pitcher Adam Wainwright sitting out the entire year due to Tommy John surgery. Upon Pujols' return, the Cardinals came within one game by defeating the Astros under nine innings of dominant pitching by ace pitcher Chris Carpenter.\nPhiladelphia Phillies at Atlanta Braves.\nWednesday, September 28, 2011 – 7:10 pm (EDT) at Turner Field in Atlanta, Georgia\nThe Philadelphia Phillies had clinched a playoff berth, the division title, and the best league record for weeks. For most of the season, the Atlanta Braves had been in 2nd place in the National League East by a good margin and well ahead in the wildcard standings. The Phillies had something to play for, a franchise record in wins. They battled back to force the game into extra innings where they won and in effect, not only eliminated the Braves from post-season contention, but also set that record with 102, surpassing the previous record of 101 set back-to-back in 1976 and 1977 during their run of three straight division championships from 1976 to 1978. Charlie Manuel also became the manager with most wins in the history of the Phillies with 646 wins, surpassing Gene Mauch, the manager of the Phillies when they collapsed in a similar way the Braves did in 1964.\nNotes.\nSome of the notable plays and events in the four games involved happened within minutes of the notable moments of other games involved, which can be seen when watching the four games simultaneously. Some examples include:\nAftermath.\nThe Rays would go on to lose the Division Series in four games to the Texas Rangers, winning only Game 1.\nThe Cardinals would go on to win the World Series over the Rangers, overcoming a 2–1 deficit in the Division Series and twice coming back from being a strike away from losing the 2011 World Series in Game 6, which was won on a walk-off home run by David Freese."

League A culminated with the Nations League Finals in February 2024 to determine the champions of the competition, and which two teams (in addition to hosts France) would qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The results were also used to determine the leagues for the UEFA Women's Euro 2025 qualifying competition.\nFormat.\nLeague A consisted of the 16 top-ranked UEFA members in the UEFA women's national team coefficient ranking, split into four groups of four. Each team played six matches within their group, using the home-and-away round-robin format with double matchdays in September, October, and November to December 2023.

        "text": "The 2022 Overwatch League Grand Finals was the fifth championship match of the Overwatch League (OWL), taking place on November 4, 2022. The series was the conclusion of the 2022 Overwatch League playoffs and was played between the Dallas Fuel and the San Francisco Shock at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California.\nDallas qualified for the season playoffs as the top seed and defeated the Hangzhou Spark, Seoul Dynasty, and Houston Outlaws all in the upper bracket to qualify for the Grand Finals. San Francisco qualified as the second seed and was defeated in their first playoff match to the Outlaws but went on to defeat the Shanghai Dragons, Los Angeles Gladiators, Dynasty, Spark, and Outlaws in the lower bracket to qualify for the Grand Finals.\nIn the Grand Finals match, Fuel defeated the Shock by a score of 4–3 to win their first OWL championship.\nRoad to the Grand Finals.\nThe Grand Finals are the post-season championship series of the Overwatch League (OWL), a professional international esports league; the teams in the 2022 Grand Finals match competed for a prize pool, where the winners received $1 million. The 2022 season was the fifth season in OWL history and consisted of twenty teams. The playoffs were contested by twelve teams – eight from the league's West region and four from the league's East region.\nThe finalists, the San Francisco Shock and the Dallas Fuel, finished the regular season with records of each, with the Fuel claiming the top seed of the playoffs and the Shock taking the second by way of league tiebreaking rules. Both the defending Overwatch League champions and runners-up, the Shanghai Dragons and Atlanta Reign, respectively, were eliminated in the first round of the lower bracket of the playoffs.\nSan Francisco Shock.\nThe Shock entered the league in 2018 as one of the twelve founding franchises. Following the 2021 season, the Shock parted ways with their entire roster, aside from support player Park \"Viol2t\" Min-ki. The team picked up five rookies to fill their squad: damage players Jung \"Kilo\" Jin-woo, Kim \"Proper\" Dong-hyun, and Samuel \"s9mm\" Santos, tank player Colin \"Coluge\" Arai, and support player Oh \"FiNN\" Se-jin.\nThe Shock began their 2022 season with a 3–0 win over the Paris Eternal. In the first tournament cycle of the season, the Kickoff Clash, the Shock went undefeated in the qualifiers, going 6–0, and qualified for the Western Kickoff Clash tournament as the top seed. In the tournament, the team ultimately lost to the Fuel in the lower bracket. Prior to the start of the second tournament cycle, the Midseason Madness, they picked up tank player Michael \"mikeyy\" Konicki. The Shock went undefeated in the Midseason Madness qualifiers, improving their record to 12–0, and qualified as the top seed in the tournament. After winning every match in the upper bracket, the Shock faced the Los Angeles Gladiators in the Midseason Madness finals. However, they lost in the finals by a score of 2–4. The Shock broke the OWL record for most consecutive regular season wins in the following tournament cycle, the Summer Showdown, winning 20 matches in a row, spanning back to the 2021 regular season. The team had their first regular season loss of the season on September 2, after they were defeated by the Fuel. With a 5–1 record in the qualifiers, the Shock advanced to the Western Summer Showdown tournament as the second seed. In the tournament, the Shock lost to the Fuel in the upper bracket and were sent to the lower bracket. They reached the finals through the lower bracket, where they once again faced the Fuel. The Shock lost the match, 0–4, finishing in second place for the second tournament in a row. Prior to the end of the regular season, the Shock picked up damage player Kwon \"Striker\" Nam-joo, who had been a part of the Shock's championship seasons in 2019 and 2020. The team finished the regular season as the second seed in the Western region with 26 league points, 20 wins, and 4 losses. Proper received numerous accolades for his performance in the regular season, being commentated as a Role Star for damage, being named the Alarm Rookie of the Year, and earning the Most Valuable Player award.\nAs the second seed in the playoffs, the team received a bye into the second round of the upper bracket. For their first opponent, the Shock selected the sixth-seeded Houston Outlaws; however, they lost to the Outlaws, 2–3, and were sent to the lower bracket. From there, San Francisco made a run through the lower bracket, defeating the fifth-seeded Shanghai Dragons, third-seeded Los Angeles Gladiators, fourth-seeded Seoul Dynasty, and the twelfth-seeded Hangzhou Spark, to reach the lower bracket finals. The Shock took down the Outlaws, who had also been knocked down to the lower bracket, by a score of 3–0 to advance to the Grand Finals.\nDallas Fuel.\nThe Dallas Fuel entered the league in 2018 as one of the twelve founding franchises. In the offseason preceding the 2022 season, the team made several roster changes. They elected not to exercise their option to retain support player Lee \"Jecse\" Seung-soo and hitscan specialist Kim \"Pine\" Do-hyeon, and support player Kim \"Rapel\" Jun-keun retired from professional \"Overwatch\". They signed three free agents: support player Han \"ChiYo\" Hyeon-seok, damage player Kang \"guriyo\" Min-seo, and hitscan specialist Kim \"Edison\" Tae-hoon.\nThe Fuel's first match of the 2022 season resulted in a loss to the Houston Outlaws in the Kickoff Clash qualifiers. Throughout the Kickoff Class qualifiers, the Fuel found success running a team composition around Choi \"Hanbin\" Han-been on Zarya and Edison on Reaper, allowing them to win their next five matches and claim the second seed in the Western Kickoff Clash tournament. The Fuel dropped to the lower bracket of the double-elimination tournament but ran through the lower bracket and reached the finals, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Gladiators. In the second tournament cycle of the season, the Midseason Madness, the Fuel were swept in their first two qualifying matches, as their Zarya-Reaper composition from the Kickoff Clash was no longer viable due to a balance patch that shifted the meta. However, the team went on to win their next four matches and claimed the third seed, and a first-round bye, in the Midseason Madness tournament. However, Dallas made an early exit from the tournament after losing to the Shanghai Dragons and Philadelphia Fusion in their first two matches. In the Summer Showdown, the third tournament cycle of the season, the league saw another meta shift with the release of \"Overwatch 2\" newest hero, Junker Queen. With Hanbin playing as one of the league's best Junker Queens, the Fuel finished the Summer Showdown qualifiers snapping the San Francisco Shock's 20-game regular season winning streak and claiming the top seed in the Western Summer Showdown tournament with a perfect 6–0 record in the qualifiers. The Fuel went undefeated in the tournament, finishing it with a 4–0 win over the Shock in the finals, and claimed their first tournament title of the season. The team finished the regular season as the top seed in the Western region with 26 league points, 20 wins, and 4 losses. Additionally, Kwon \"Fielder\" Joon, ChiYo and Hanbin were awarded Role Star commendations at the end of the regular season for the support, support, and tank roles, respectively.\nIn the playoffs, the league saw another meta shift, with the release of the hero Kiriko, and Dallas elected to bring back Lee \"Fearless\" Eui-seok into the starting roster over Hanbin, with Fearless playing Winston. With a bye to the second round of the upper bracket, the Fuel selected the twelfth-seeded Hangzhou Spark as their first opponent; Dallas defeated them by a score of 3–1. Next, they swept the fourth-seeded Seoul Dynasty, 3–0, in the upper bracket semifinals. In the upper bracket finals, the Fuel faced their in-state rivals, the Outlaws. Dallas lost the first map of the match but went on to win the following three, defeating the Outlaws, 3–1, and advanced to the Grand Finals.\nVenue.\nThe Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California was announced as the 2022 OWL Grand Finals host venue on September 19, 2022. It was the first time that the Grand Finals had been held live since the 2019 Grand Finals in Philadelphia.

The Gators would go 3–3 against their first two conference opponents in Alabama and LSU, and defeated in their annual game in Jacksonville. However, Florida got swept at Georgia to drop to 3–6 in conference play. The Gators bounced back by taking the series against No. 2 Arkansas at home to get back to 5–7 against the conference. Traveling to Tallahassee to play the second of three games against Florida State, the Seminoles evened the series at one win apiece. The Gators lost their next two games in Nashville before avoiding the sweep against Vanderbilt. Florida would return home to host the top-ranked Tennessee Volunteers, who had lost only one conference game up to that point. The Volunteers were able to sweep the Gators by mounting a ninth-inning comeback and 11-inning defeat in the series finale, to move the Gators to 6–12 against the conference, featuring a 4–11 stretch against the gauntlet of LSU, Georgia, Arkansas, Vanderbilt, and Tennessee. The Gators moved to an even 15–15 conference record by the end of the season, winning each of their remaining series against Kentucky, defending national champion Mississippi State, Missouri, and South Carolina, and won the season series against Florida State in Gainesville with a 7–5 ten-inning victory.\nIn a SEC baseball tournament marred by significant weather delays, the Gators were able to overcome a second-round loss to Texas A&amp;M by winning their next three games, including a semifinal win to avenge their earlier second round loss to the Aggies, to set up a Championship Game against the regular season champion Volunteers. Florida was able to stymie the prolific Volunteers offense for the first four innings, but ultimately surrendered the first seven runs of the game in a 5–8 loss.\nFlorida's run in the SEC Tournament proved to be enough to earn a No. 13 national seed, and host the Gainesville Regional. After a second-round loss to the Oklahoma Sooners, Florida was able to hold off Central Michigan with a 6–5 victory in the elimination game to set up a rematch against Oklahoma in the regional final. Florida was able to take the first game with a 7–2 victory to set up a winner-take-all game for the right to advance to the Super Regional against Virginia Tech. Florida got a 2–1 lead in the seventh inning before a 5-hour, 33-minute rain delay struck Gainesville. Florida was able to add to their lead to obtain a 3–1 advantage over the Sooners in the bottom of the seventh inning, but surrendered four runs in the top of the eighth inning, and was only able to make up one of the runs in the bottom of the ninth inning. As a result, their season came to a close with a late-night, rain delayed, 4–5 home loss to the eventual national runners-up.\nPreseason.\nPreseason SEC awards and honors.\nOutfielder and catcher, Wyatt Langford and BT Riopelle, respectively, were named to the All-SEC preseason first-team.\nCoaches poll.\nThe SEC baseball coaches' poll was released on February 9, 2023."

In December 2010, Parkwood Leisure took over operation of the pool on behalf of the council. In April 2011, the firm stated that it believed the pool had a viable future and that it could remain open alongside Hengrove Park.\nIn 2017, the council launched a consultation on its plans to withdraw the £62,000 subsidy required for the pool to operate. Following protest from local residents, the council decided to renew its contract with Parkwood Leisure for another five years. The pool was threatened with closure again in August 2020 when the council launched another consultation.\nOn 30 September 2022, management of the pool was transferred from the council to the Friends of Jubilee Pool under a 35-year lease. It is the first swimming pool in Bristol to be community owned. It will initially continue to be operated by Parkwood Leisure."

        "title": "Celtic Cup (wheelchair rugby league)",
        "text": "The Celtic Cup is an international wheelchair rugby league tournament contested annually by Scotland, Ireland and Wales. It was first held as a two-match series between Scotland and Ireland in 2015 which was won by Ireland. Wales joined in 2016 to create a three-team round-robin tournament and have won the cup seven times between 2016 and 2023.\nHistory.\nThe Ireland, Scotland and Wales teams were all established in 2012 and played their first international matches at the Four Nations competition that year before taking part in the World Cup in 2013. The Celtic Cup was established to provide an opportunity for international matches beyond these tournaments, initially between Ireland and Scotland in 2015, and with Wales in 2016.\nThe first leg of the inaugural Celtic Cup was played on 18 April 2015 at the Dundee International Sports Centre, Dundee. It was the first international wheelchair rugby league match to be played in Scotland. Ireland took an early 28-point lead and went on to win the match 52–28. The second leg took place on 24 May at the Blackpool Sports Centre, Blackpool, on the same weekend as the rugby league Summer Bash. Logistically this made sense for Ireland whose captain, Damian McCabe, noted that the sport was \"not being played in Ireland at the moment\" and that most of the squad lived in northern England. This time Ireland took a 68–10 lead at half-time eventually winning the match 80–48 to win the series with an aggregate score of 132–76.\nIreland hosted the second Celtic Cup on 30 April 2016, which was again played at the Blackpool Sports Centre. In 2016 it became a three-team competition when Wales were invited to take part. The match between Ireland and Scotland ended as a draw with both sides scoring 58 points. Wales won both of their matches defeating Ireland 76–26 and Scotland 92–22 to win the cup for the first time.\nWales retained their title on 29 April 2017 when the tournament was held at The Peak, Stirling. Hosts Scotland lost their opening fixture 16–26 against Ireland and were kept scoreless by Wales who defeated them 72–0 having already beaten Ireland by a score of 51–6 earlier in the day.\nThe 2018 Celtic Cup was held on 28 April at the Deeside Leisure Centre, Queensferry. Wales, who were hosting an international wheelchair rugby league tournament for the first time, began their title defence with a 112–41 win over Scotland. Ireland also defeated Scotland 68–36, but then lost 84–30 to Wales who claimed a third Celtic Cup title.\nThe 2019 Celtic Cup took place on 27 April at Calderdale College, Halifax. Wales dominated the tournament scoring centuries in each of their games, firstly against Scotland 102-10 and then Ireland 109–8, to take a fourth consecutive title. In the final game Scotland came back from 18–38 at half-time to defeat Ireland 52–42. It was the first win for Scotland in any international since 24 September 2015 when they had beaten both Ireland and Wales in the European Championships.\nThe Celtic Cup was postponed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It resumed in 2021 and was held on 12 June at the Oriam Performance Centre at Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh, as the originally proposed venue, The Pleasance sports complex at the University of Edinburgh, was being used as a COVID-19 testing centre. The hosts lost 32–52 to Ireland in the opening game. Ireland then faced Wales who defeated them 96-16 and in a repeat of the 2019 tournament Wales scored a century against Scotland to win 102-18 and maintain their unbeaten record in the Celtic Cup.\nOn 7 May 2022 the Celtic Cup was held at the Plas Madoc Leisure Centre, Wrexham. Hosts and defending champions Wales defeated Ireland 64–22 in the opening fixture. The second game was close with Ireland taking the victory 38–35 over Scotland. In the final match Wales won 116–6 setting a new record for their biggest win and claiming a sixth Celtic Cup.\nThe 2023 tournament took take place at the Oriam Performance Centre, Edinburgh, on 18 June. Ireland won 58–24 against Scotland in the opening fixture and then drew 30–30 with Wales. This was the 50th international match played by Wales and the first time that they had ever drawn a match. It was also their first Celtic Cup match that they had not won and meant they needed to win by 35 points against Scotland in the final game of the tournament. They achieved this with a 76–30 win to retain the title.\nThe 2024 tournament is scheduled to take place on 8 June and to be held at the University of Galway in Ireland."

The race took place from 23 to 30 July 2023, and was the 21st race in the 2023 UCI Women's World Tour calendar.\nStage 1.\nThe first stage took the riders on a loop around Clermont-Ferrand that was generally flat, with a third category climb (Côte de Durtol) with an average gradient of 7.6% located before the finish.\nThe first stage initially saw several attempts at a breakaway, with Marta Lach (Ceratizit–WNT Pro Cycling) being the most successful, opening a gap of 50\" to the peloton before being caught ahead of the intermediate sprint in . After crashing at , Mireia Benito (AG Insurance–Soudal–Quick-Step) was forced to abandon and was taken to the hospital, but suffered no serious injuries other than a concussion. \nWith 300 metres remaining of the Côte de Durtol, Lotte Kopecky (SD Worx) launched an attack with left of the stage. Further accelerating within the final 5 kilometers of the stage, she eventually took a solo stage win by 41 seconds ahead of the peloton. Behind her, Lorena Wiebes (SD Worx) won the bunch sprint. The high pace set on the final climb led to splits in the peloton, with only 25 riders finishing within a minute of Wiebes.\nKopecky therefore took the \"maillot jaune\" (yellow jersey) of the general classification (GC), as well as the points classification and the Queen of the Mountains (QoM) classification. Cédrine Kerbaol (Ceratizit–WNT Pro Cycling) took the lead in the young rider classification. \nStage 2.\nThe second stage took the riders south from Clermont-Ferrand to Mauriac, over a hilly course with six categorised climbs. The final of the stage included the Côte de Trebiac (3.4km with an average gradient of 5.8%) and the final 500m of the stage having an average gradient of 5.6%.\nThe second stage was held in cooler weather, with drizzle turning into heavy rain by the end of the stage. The first half of the stage featured several attacks by riders that were neutralised by the peloton. The climbs of Côtes des Plaines (4.5km with an average gradient of 5.5%) and the Côte des Boissieres (1.2km with an average gradient of 7.2%) split the bunch, with a minor crash delaying general classification contenders Annemiek van Vleuten (Movistar Team) and Elisa Longo Borghini (Lidl–Trek).\nAs the rain got heavier, several riders crashed in the last . One of the breakaway riders, (Jumbo–Visma) had a serious crash on the descent of the final climb while trying to avoid a motorbike, with her contacting the crash barrier with her head. She was taken to hospital where it turned out she had a concussion. \nIn the final , Katarzyna Niewiadoma (Canyon–SRAM), Juliette Labous (DSM–Firmenich) and Marlen Reusser (SD Worx) all attempted individual attacks on the climb of the Côte de Trebiac, with the remaining peloton capturing them before the final kilometre. In the uphill sprint finish for the line, Demi Vollering (SD Worx) led out her teammate Kopecky, however Liane Lippert (Movistar Team) overtook Kopecky in the final 100 metres to take the stage. \nAfter the stage, Kopecky realised she had a slow puncture that had dampened her sprint. Neither of the key favourites - Vollering or Van Vleuten - had attempted attacks on the stage, with Vollering stating that she wished to \"save my legs for Wednesday and Saturday\". Kopecky retained the yellow jersey of the general classification and the lead of the points classification, Kerbaol retained the lead of the young rider classification, and Yara Kastelijn (Fenix–Deceuninck) took the lead of the classification. \nStage 3.\nThe third stage took the riders west from Collonges-la-Rouge to Montignac-Lascaux over a course considered flat, albeit with five categorised climbs. However the final climb was from the finish, and therefore a bunch sprint was expected.\nPrior to the stage, Špela Kern (Cofidis) withdrew from the race after her crash on stage 2. After just , Kathrin Hammes (EF Education–Tibco–SVB) escaped from the peloton for a solo breakaway, eventually establishing a lead of two minutes. After collecting seven points, she was captured by the peloton with around remaining. After several riders attempted attacks from the peloton, Julie Van de Velde (Fenix–Deceuninck) escaped with around remaining. Taking four points over the final two climbs of Côte des Andrieux (2.6 km with an average gradient of 4.1%) and Côte de Saint-Robert (1.1 km with an average gradient of 6.2%), she took the lead of the mountains classification while building up a lead of around a minute over the peloton. The sprinters teams in the peloton - including SD Worx, DSM–Firmenich and Jumbo–Visma - led the chase for the anticipated bunch sprint.\nHowever Van de Velde extended her lead to 2 minutes with remaining. The time gap between her and the peloton fell as the sprinters teams gave chase, but Van de Velde held on towards the finish - with a lead of 35 seconds with to go, and a 10 second lead into the final kilometre of the stage. In the final sprint, the sprinters teams caught Van de Velde with 300 metres to go. Wiebes outsprinted Marianne Vos (Jumbo–Visma) for the stage win, with the yellow jersey of Kopecky finishing third.\nA two second split at the finish allowed Kopecky to extend her lead over Lippert to 55\", with other contenders including Vollering and Van Vleuten ten seconds further behind. Kopecky also retained her lead in the points classification, Van de Velde took the polka dot jersey of the classification, and Kerbaol retained the lead of the young rider classification. \nStage 4.\nThe longest stage of the race took the riders eastwards over a hilly course from Cahors to Rodez. Five categorised climbs were on the route, with the second category Côte de Moyrazès (4.6km with an average gradient of 5.5%) and the third category Côte de Lavernhe (2.2km with an average gradient of 7.1%) located in the last of the stage. Another climb had bonus seconds available at the top. The last 500 metres of the stage in Rodez had an average gradient of 8.2%, with sections of 13%. It was considered that the contenders would attempt to win the stage, given the bonus seconds available at the finish.\nThe early break contained 14 riders, including the French national champion Audrey Cordon-Ragot (Human Powered Health), Anouska Koster (Jumbo–Visma) and Yara Kastelijn (Fenix–Deceuninck). The gap to the peloton slowly grew, reaching 6 minutes after and over 10 minutes after the climb of Côte de Falgevras. This put Cordon-Ragot in the virtual lead of the , as she had been 2' 21\" behind Kopecky.\nThe peloton slowly picked up the pace, with SD Worx taking control to chase the breakaway as they hit the hilly section at the end of the stage. On the third category Côte de Colombiès (6.5 km with an average gradient of 4.2%), the gap to the break fell dramatically to four minutes. With around remaining, Cordon-Ragot sprinted to take the bonus seconds available at Limayrac. On the second category Côte de Moyrazès, Kastelijn and Cordon-Ragot broke clear from the breakaway group - however Cordon-Ragot was unable to hold the wheel and Kastelijn went solo to try and win the stage.\nBehind them, the contenders were racing each other - with Kopecky giving chase to try and retain her yellow jersey. Vollering and Van Vleuten then attacked each other on the final climb of the stage, the third category Côte de Lavernhe, overtaking remains of the breakaway. Over the summit, Vollering attacked again with Van Vleuten struggling to follow. With key contenders coming back together, a fast pace was set approaching the tough finish in Rodez. \nVollering then attacked in the steep final kilometre, to finish two seconds ahead of Van Vleuten before celebrating as she thought she'd won the stage. However, Kastelijn had won the stage by 1' 11\", her first major stage win in the UCI Women's World Tour. Other contenders finished within 30 seconds of Vollering, with no one losing substantial time. Cordon-Ragot finished 1' 45\" behind Kastelijn, moving up 8 places on to 20th overall.\nKopecky therefore retained her yellow jersey of the , albeit with her lead cut to 43\". Kopecky also retained her lead in the points classification. Vollering was in second place on , eight seconds ahead of her main rival Van Vleuten thanks to six bonus seconds at the finish line. Koster took the polka dot jersey of the classification thanks to the points collected while in the breakaway, and Kerbaol retained the lead of the young rider classification.\nStage 5.\nThe fifth stage took the riders south from Onet-le-Château to Albi over a course considered flat, albeit with three categorised climbs. The final into Albi was generally flat, and a sprint finish was expected. \nPrior to the start of the stage, SD Worx team director Anna van der Breggen reported that stage 3 winner Wiebes was sick, and would not start the stage. Évita Muzic (FDJ–Suez) abandoned the Tour due to illness early on in the stage - a setback for her team leader Cecilie Uttrup Ludwig. Kastelijn took the points over the first two climbs of the stage, taking the lead in the mountains classification. \nVollering got a puncture with of the stage remaining and replaced the back wheel of her bike. She then drafted her team car to get back to the main bunch. Commissaires were unhappy about the length of time this occurred, with Vollering subsequently penalised 20 seconds in the general classification.\nRicarda Bauernfeind (Canyon–SRAM) then attacked on the descent of the Côte de Laguépie. She built up a lead of around 1' 30\" ahead of the peloton, however this advantage fell on the final climb of the stage, the Côte de Monestiés. With remaining of the stage, Bauernfeind's lead was just 40 seconds. The peloton gave chase, however the gap did not fall fast enough to Bauernfeind, an experienced time trialist. With to go, the gap was still 30 seconds - with Lippert and Reusser attacking from the front of the peloton to catch her. \nBauernfeind was too strong, and crossed the finish line 22 seconds ahead of Lippert and Reusser, becoming the youngest ever winner of a stage at the Tour de France Femmes. She had averaged over the last of the stage. The peloton finished 10 seconds further behind, with Kopecky winning the sprint for the minor placings.\nKopecky retained the yellow jersey of the and extended her lead in the points classification to 47 points. Kastelijn took the polka dot jersey of the mountains classification, and Kerbaol retained the lead of the young rider classification. \nVollering's 20 second penalty dropped her to 7th place in the , 12 seconds behind her rival Van Vleuten. Following the stage, \"directeur sportif\" of SD Worx Danny Stam queried if commissaries were \"capable of leading this Tour\". He was subsequently removed from the race due to \"inappropriate comments\" made to the commissaires, as well as his \"dangerous overtaking ... of cars and riders\" while Vollering was drafting his car.\nStage 6.\nThe sixth stage was the final flat stage of the race, over a course from Albi to Blagnac. Continuing to head south towards the Pyrenees, the stage had four categorised climbs before a flat finish in Blagnac. The stage was the final chance for sprinters to win, given the parcours of the remaining stages.\nEarly on in the stage, Lotta Henttala (AG Insurance–Soudal–Quick-Step) was disqualified after holding onto her team car. The \"directeur sportif\" of the team was also asked to leave the race. Henttala and AG Insurance–Soudal–Quick-Step later refuted the claims of the commissaires, stating that she \"held onto a water bottle for a few seconds but did not hang onto the team car\".\nA three rider breakaway of Emma Norsgaard (Movistar Team), Agnieszka Skalniak-Sójka and Sandra Alonso was formed with around to go, establishing a lead around 2 minutes. contender Veronica Ewers (EF Education–Tibco–SVB) crashed heavily with remaining, landing in a ditch. After being attended to by doctors, she remounted to finish the stage inside the time cut, albeit in pain. Taken to hospital following the stage, it later transpired that Ewers had a broken collarbone and would not start stage 7.\nIn the closing kilometres, the gap to the break steadily fell as the sprinters teams gave chase, with Alonso dropping from the break with around 5km to go. Norsgaard did not give up, extending the gap back up to 20 seconds with to go. In the finale into Blagnac, the course crossed the Toulouse tramway just before the \"flamme rouge\" of 1 kilometre to go. The tight chicane over the tram tracks caused a small crash, distracting the peloton and delaying some riders as they gave chase. Riders subsequently criticised the chicane, with Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance–Soudal–Quick-Step) calling it \"super, super dangerous\". \nWith 600 metres to the finish, Norsgaard launched an attack to stay ahead of the peloton, as the gap collapsed behind her. Norsgaard held on to win the stage by a second, the fourth breakaway rider to win a stage at the Tour, and her first UCI Women's World Tour win. Behind her, Charlotte Kool (Team DSM–Firmenich) came second, with third placed Kopecky in the yellow jersey visibly annoyed not to have caught Norsgaard before the finish line. \nKopecky retained the yellow jersey of the and extended her lead in the points classification to 69 points. Kastelijn retained the polka dot jersey of the mountains classification, 4 points ahead of Koster. Kerbaol retained the lead of the young rider classification, with a 2' 45\" lead over Ella Wyllie (Lifeplus–Wahoo).\nStage 7.\nThe seventh stage of the race was the queen stage of the race, a stage in the Pyrenees from Lannemezan to a summit finish at the Col du Tourmalet. The riders tackled two climbs - starting with the first category Col d'Aspin (12km with an average gradient of 6.5%) before ascending the hors catégorie Col du Tourmalet (17.1km with an average gradient of 7.5%), with an elevation of . The climbs were last tackled by the peloton at the 2007 Grande Boucle, with a summit finish last occurring in the 2000 edition of the race.\nPrior to the start of the stage, Lidl–Trek riders Elisa Longo Borghini (who was 4th on , 55\" behind Kopecky) and Elisa Balsamo withdrew due to a skin infection and fatigue respectively. \nEarly on in the stage, Vos abandoned the race, in light of the Road World Championships in early August. After initial skirmishes prior to the Col d'Aspin, the peloton hit the first climb with GC contenders immediately powering away from the rest of the field, leaving Kastelijn in the polka dot jersey behind. from the top, Van Vleuten launched an attack, followed by her rival Vollering as well as Niewiadoma. Niewiadoma took the points at the top of the climb. Over the top of the climb, Kopecky limited her time loss to the leading trio to under a minute. On the descent, Niewiadoma was substantially faster than both Vollering and Van Vleuten. The two rivals did not wish to work together to chase Niewiadoma. Instead, they decided to wait for teammates behind, allowing Niewiadoma's lead to balloon to nearly 45 seconds.\nOn the ascent of the Col du Tourmalet, the yellow jersey group including Labous, Moolman Pasio, Reusser, Kopecky, Vollering and Van Vleuten worked to reduce the gap to Niewiadoma to just 6 seconds. But Niewiadoma kept working, eventually extending her lead over the yellow jersey group to 30 seconds with to go. \nIn thick fog, Vollering attacked with to the summit, with Van Vleuten unable to follow. Passing Niewiadoma a few kilometres later, Vollering soloed to the top of the climb, winning the stage by 1' 58\" ahead of Niewiadoma. Van Vleuten finished the stage 2' 34\" behind Vollering in third, with the yellow jersey of Kopecky finishing 6th on the stage, 3' 32\" behind Vollering. The tough stage caused large time gaps, with only 18 riders finishing within 10 minutes of Vollering. Two riders finishing outside the time limit, including sprinter Charlotte Kool.\nVollering therefore took the yellow jersey of the general classification, with a lead of 1' 50\" ahead of Niewiadoma. Van Vleuten took 3rd on , 2' 28\" behind Vollering. Kopecky fell to 4th overall, just seven seconds behind Van Vleuten and four seconds ahead of Moolman Pasio in 5th place. Niewiadoma took the polka dot jersey of the mountains classification, with a 4 point lead over Kastelijn. Kopecky retained her green jersey of the points classification. Kerbaol retained the young rider classification, despite losing 44 seconds to her rival Wyllie.\nStage 8.\nThe final stage of the race was an individual time trial over a twisting course in Pau. The course was similar to one previously used for a time trial at the 2019 Tour de France, as well as for the 2019 La Course by Le Tour de France stage race.\nPrior to the start of the stage, Mavi Garcia (Liv Racing TeqFind) withdrew from 15th place overall due to illness. It was considered unlikely that Vollering would lose the yellow jersey on the stage, in light of her 1' 50\" lead over Niewiadoma. However third placed Kopecky was just seven seconds behind Van Vleuten and four seconds ahead of Moolman-Pasio.\nVittoria Guazzini (FDJ–Suez) was the seventh rider to start, setting a fast time that was not beaten for over an hour. Her time was finally beaten by her teammate Grace Brown, who set a time 28\" faster. Brown's time was then beaten by Reusser, two time silver medalist at the time trial world championships and silver medalist in the time trial at Tokyo 2020. \nKopecky then set a fast time, 38 seconds slower than Reusser, overtaking her two minute woman Moolman-Pasio in the last two kilometres. Van Vleuten was then 1' 41\" slower than Reusser, finishing 14th on the stage. She fell off the overall podium into fourth place. Niewiadoma had a 38\" lead over Van Vleuten, and a 45\" lead over Kopecky. Her time trial was 1' 23\" slower than Reusser, finishing 9th on the stage. Kopecky took second place overall by 21 hundredths of a second.\nThe last rider to start was Vollering, who maintained a fast pace throughout the time trial to finish second on the stage, 10\" behind Reusser - sealing her victory. Reusser's time of 29' 15\" was therefore the fastest time on the stage. However her time did not elevate her substantially in the , rising two places to 28th overall.\nIn the final general classification (GC), Demi Vollering (SD Worx) won the Tour de France Femmes with an advantage over her teammate Lotte Kopecky of over three minutes. Finishing in third place for the second year in a row was Katarzyna Niewiadoma (), who finished just 21 hundredths of a second behind Kopecky.\nIn the race's other classifications, Kopecky won the points classification. Apart from finishing third in the , Niewiadoma also took the polka-dot jersey as winner of the Queen of the Mountains (QoM) classification. Cédrine Kerbaol of took the white jersey as the winner of the young riders classification, which was awarded to the best-placed rider under the age of 23. SD Worx won the team classification as the team with the lowest aggregate time among their three best-placed riders. Yara Kastelijn took the super-combativity award to add to her win on stage 4. Out of 154 starters, 123 finished the event.\nVollering expressed her delight following her victory, stating that she \"still can't believe it\". Her rival Van Vleuten was disappointed with her performance, and praised Vollering for her victory. She also explained that illness had dampened her performance in both the final time trial and the mountainous stage 7. Niewiadoma was pleased with her polka dot jersey, while expressing disappointment to lose 2nd place overall."

They failed to qualify for the ASUN tournament.\nPrevious season.\nThe Gamecocks finished the 2021–22 season 21–11, 13–3 in ASUN play to finish in first place in the West division. As the No. 1 seed in the ASUN tournament, the Gamecocks defeated Kennesaw State in the quarterfinals before losing in the semifinals to Jacksonville. However, because the eventual tournament champion, Bellarmine, was ineligible for the NCAA tournament due to their transition to Division I, Jacksonville State received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament as the No. 15 seed in the Midwest region. They lost in the first round of the tournament to Auburn.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=13 style=| ASUN Conference regular season\nSources"

        "text": "The Hidden Game of Baseball is a book by baseball statisticians John Thorn and Pete Palmer. It was published in 1984 by Doubleday and is considered to be a seminal work in the fields of sabermetrics and baseball history.\nOverview.\nThorn and Palmer began collaborating on an encyclopedia under the working title \"Complete Baseball\", but could not meet the publisher's schedule. Instead, they began working on a smaller work focused on sabermetrics. \"The Hidden Game\" reappraised the relationship between in-game activity and the outcome of baseball games, suggesting that many of the statistics traditionally focused on up to that point did not meaningfully contribute to the likelihood of wins or losses. Palmer pioneered the use of linear weights in baseball statistics - adding up the weighted values of individual events to come up with a single number that represents the total value of a player's contributions. It formed the basis for Palmer's Total Player Rating, a direct ancestor to Wins Above Replacement (WAR). It is also credited with popularizing the use of run expectation tables in baseball analysis.\nThe book received critical praise at the time of its publication, and has since been reprinted."

        "title": "Rensselaer–Union men's ice hockey rivalry",
        "text": "The Rensselaer–Union men's ice hockey rivalry is a college ice hockey rivalry between the RPI Engineers men's ice hockey and Union Garnet Chargers men's ice hockey programs. The first meeting between the two occurred on February 26, 1904.\nHistory.\nRensselaer was one of the first schools outside of the Ivy League to play varsity ice hockey, holing their first game during the 1901–02 season. Two years later, The Cherry and White met their capital district counterparts for the first time. Because neither program had an on-campus rink, the game was played at the Empire Rink in nearby Albany, New York. The converted curling venue wasn't well suited for ice hockey and only used sparingly by RPI. Both programs were forced to suspend operations over the next few years due to warm winters that prevented natural ice surfaces from being usable. They renewed their series in 1908, however, Union played just one game over the following two years before shuttering the program for a decade.\nAfter World War I, Union restarted its program and the two eventually began to play annually. Helping the budding rivalry were on-campus rinks that had been built in the interim. While both venues were of the open-air variety, they were a vast improvement over the previous situation. Unfortunately, just as the rivalry was beginning to grow, financial difficulties brought on by The Great Depression caused Rensselaer to suspend its program in 1931. The Engineers attempted to return in the mid-30's but were only able to play 4 total games before having to halt once more. Union continued on in their rival's absence but they too were forced to suspend play after the outbreak of World War II. Once the war was over, the Skating Dutchmen tried to rekindle the program but their poor facilities became an issue. Inconsistent weather conditions wreaked havoc with open-air rinks and it had become apparent that Union could need an enclosed arena if they were to continue playing hockey. After only being able to play a single game in 1949, the program suspended until a permanent solution could be found.\nCoincidentally, the following year Rensselaer finally returned to the ice when the Houston Field House was completed. Rensselaer was able to use the new rink to great effect and became a preeminent program for a time. They won the 1954 National Championship under Ned Harkness and were a founding member of ECAC Hockey several years later.\nIn the mid-70's, after more than 25 years without a game, Union College resurrected its ice hockey program. The completion of the Achilles Rink in 1975 gave the Dutchmen the home they had needed while Harkness set about rebuilding the program from scratch. When Union returned, however, they did so at the Division II level and were able to immediately become a successful team. While there was an expectation that the program would soon make the jump to the top level, school administrators had other ideas. A dispute between Harkness and the college caused the coach to leave mid-way through his third season and set the program back by several years. It would be seven years before the Dutchmen would post another winning record and any rumors about their promotion to Division I were quashed.\nin spite of the difficulties for Union, the program was able to restart its rivalry with Rensselaer in 1981. The two played at least one annually over a decade with the Engineers, predictably, dominating the play. When Union finally made the jump to Division I in 1991, they joined the Engineers in ECAC Hockey, where they have remained ever since (as of 2022).\nSince becoming conference rivals, the two have played at least twice every year. They have also met several times during the conference postseason. In 2006, the two began jointly hosting the Governor's Cup, a four-team in-season tournament. The series was discontinued after the third edition. The trophy that was used was called the 'Mayor's Cup'. Rather than discard the award, it was used for a new annual game held at the end of January. The first two meetings were at the Herb Brooks Arena before being moved to the MVP Arena in Albany.\nGame results.\nFull game results for the rivalry, with rankings beginning in the 1998–99 season."

He played college basketball for the Alabama Crimson Tide. He was a consensus five-star recruit out of high school. He was the second overall pick in the 2023 NBA draft by the Hornets.\nEarly life and high school career.\nMiller grew up in Antioch, Tennessee, and attended Cane Ridge High School. He was named the Tennessee Gatorade Player of the Year after averaging 23.3 points, eight rebounds, 4.3 assists, 2.6 blocks, and 2.3 steals per game during his junior season. Miller repeated as the Gatorade Player of the Year and was named Tennessee Mr. Basketball as a senior after averaging 24.1 points, 8.5 rebounds, 4.3 assists, and 2.3 steals per game. He also played in the Jordan Brand Classic and the McDonald's All-American Game.\nRecruiting.\nMiller was a consensus five-star recruit and one of the top players in the 2022 class, according to major recruiting services. His first scholarship offer was from Tennessee State who are coached by his cousin, Brian Collins. On November 1, 2021, Miller committed to playing college basketball for Alabama after considering offers from Kansas and Tennessee State. He also considered playing professionally in Australia's NBL or the G League Ignite.\nCollege career.\nMiller was named to the Naismith College Player of the Year and Julius Erving Award watch lists entering his freshman season at Alabama. On November 21, 2022, Miller earned his first Southeastern Conference (SEC) Freshman of the Week honor. On December 17, 2022, Miller scored 36 points and six rebounds against Gonzaga. He posted an Alabama freshman-record 41 points on February 22, 2023, in a 78–76 overtime win against South Carolina. Miller was named the Most Valuable Player of the 2023 SEC men's basketball tournament after averaging 20.3 points and 11 rebounds over three games. He finished the season averaging an SEC-high 18.8 points per game and also averaged 8.2 rebounds and 2.1 assists.\nAt the end of the regular season, Miller was named the SEC Player of the Year, the SEC Rookie of the Year, and first-team All-Conference. He was a consensus second-team All-American selection after being selected to the first teams of the Associated Press and \"Sporting News\" and the second teams of NABC and USBWA selections. Miller was also named the USBWA National Freshman of the Year and the NABC Freshman of the Year.\nMiller struggled in the NCAA tournament, shooting just 19% from the field in Alabama's three games, the worst percentage by any player with 35 shot attempts in the tournament since 1985. Alabama fell in the third round of the tournament to San Diego State, with Miller going 3-of-19 from the floor. After the season Miller announced that he would forgo the remainder of his collegiate eligibility and enter the 2023 NBA draft.\nProfessional career.\nCharlotte Hornets (2023–present).\nThe Charlotte Hornets selected Miller with the second overall pick in the 2023 NBA draft.\nOn October 25, 2023, Miller made his NBA regular-season debut, scoring 13 points in a 116–110 win over the Atlanta Hawks. On November 18, Miller scored a then career-high 29 points in a 122–108 loss to the New York Knicks.\nOn January 29, 2024, Miller scored 29 points, tying his career-high at the time, in a 113–92 loss to the New York Knicks. On February 4, Miller scored a career-high 35 points in a 115–99 loss to the Indiana Pacers.\nPersonal life.\nMiller's father, Darrell Miller, played college football as a tight end at Alabama under head coach Gene Stallings in the early 1990s. His older brother, Darrell Jr., played college basketball at Fisk University and professionally overseas. Miller's older sister, Britany, plays at Cumberland University.\nHe stated that his GOAT (for \"Greatest Of All Time\") is Paul George and that he modelled his game after him on an episode of George's podcast.\nFirearm incident.\nOn February 21, 2023, a Tuscaloosa police officer testified that Miller brought a firearm to teammate Darius Miles that was used in the fatal shooting of 23-year-old Jamea Jonae Harris in Tuscaloosa earlier that year. According to Miller's attorney, Miles had left the gun in Miller's vehicle after Miller dropped Miles off at a club. As Miller was on his way back to pick up Miles, Miles texted Miller, requesting that Miller bring Miles's gun. When Miller arrived, Miles told his friend Michael Davis that the gun was in the vehicle. Davis retrieved the gun and shot into a vehicle in which Harris was a passenger, while Harris's boyfriend returned fire, resulting in two bullets striking Miller's car. Miller's attorney stated that Miller had no knowledge of any intent to use the weapon. According to the Tuscaloosa police officer's testimony, while Miles and Davis initially lied to officers about the incident, Miller’s account of the shooting almost exactly matched what investigators gathered from video evidence and other witness testimony. Tuscaloosa County chief deputy district attorney Paula Whitley stated Miller faces no charges as a result of the incident."

        "text": "The Ireland national wheelchair rugby league team represents Ireland in wheelchair rugby league. They have competed at the World Cup, the European Championships, the Celtic Cup and Four Nations competitions.\nHistory.\nIn July 2012 Ireland took part their first international competition, the Four Nations, a round-robin tournament between England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The tournament was held as part of preparations for the world cup taking place the following year. At the 2013 World Cup Ireland lost their matches against Wales and England. A win against Scotland was not enough to progress to the semi-finals, but they defeated Scotland in a play-off to take fifth place. Ireland finished second at the 2014 Four Nations. In 2015 Ireland played Scotland in the first Celtic Cup which was contested over two matches but became an annual three-team round-robin with the addition of Wales in 2016. At the 2015 European Championships their only group stage win was against Wales, but with a play-off win over Scotland they took third place in the tournament. \nIn 2016 Ireland were unable to travel with a full team for the Four Nations so their place was filled by a mixed team of Irish, Welsh and English players known as the Exiles. At the 2021 World Cup Ireland were not initially selected to take part but were brought in to replace Norway who had withdrawn from the tournament. Ireland were knocked out at the group stage after losses to Spain and Australia before suffering a record defeat (0–121) in their final match against England."

        "title": "2022–23 SIU Edwardsville Cougars men's basketball team",
        "text": "The 2022–23 SIU Edwardsville Cougars men's basketball team represented Southern Illinois University Edwardsville in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Cougars, led by fourth-year head coach Brian Barone, played their home games at the First Community Arena in Edwardsville, Illinois as members of the Ohio Valley Conference. They finished the season 19–14, 9–9 in OVC play to finish in a tie for sixth place. As the No. 6 seed in the OVC tournament, they defeated Southern Indiana in the first round before losing to UT Martin.\nPrevious season.\nThe Cougars finished the 2021–22 season 11–21, 4–13 in OVC play to finish in eighth place. They lost in the first round of the OVC tournament to Tennessee State.\nDespite missing a third of the season to injury, SIUE freshman guard Ray'Sean Taylor was named to the \"Kyle Macy Freshmen All-America Team\" and was a finalist for the \"Kyle Macy Award\" given to the top freshman in NCAA Division I college basketball.\nSeason forecast.\nEight players return from the 2021–22 squad. They are joined by two freshmen (one a walk-on), four transfers from junior colleges (including the NABC JuCo Player of the Year), and one graduate student transfer from a Division I program with a year of remaining eligibility.\nIn a vote of Ohio Valley Conference head men's basketball coaches and communication directors, SIUE was picked to finish 5th in the 10 team Ohio Valley Conference, while receiving two first place votes. Guard Ray’Sean Taylor and forward DeeJuan Pruitt were named to the 10 member \"2022-23 Preseason All-OVC Team.\" \nRegular season.\nThe Cougars opened the season against once frequent opponent, Harris Stowe of St. Louis. Double doubles from DeeJuan Pruitt (20 pts, 10 reb.) and Damarco Minor (11 pts, 10 asst.) led SIUE to a 28 point win, 85-57. Lamar Wright and Ray'Sean Taylor also scored in double digits, with 12 Cougar players seeing game action.\nDefending Horizon League champion Purdue Fort Wayne took a double digit first half lead on the Cougars with a barrage of 3 point buckets. SIUE made a comeback in the second half, cutting the lead to three before the Mastodons' long range shooting locked up their win.\nOn November 14, the Ohio Valley Conference named Damarco Minor the \"OVC Newcomer of the Week\" for his play in games against Harris Stowe and Purdue Fort Wayne.\nMissouri shot 60% from the field and dominated SIUE 105-80, despite four Cougars scoring in double figures.\nIn their opener of the \"JK54 Classic\" round robin tournament, there were 18 ties and 13 lead changes before SIUE beat Fairleigh Dickinson 79-78 on a 10-foot turnaround-jumper with 6.5 seconds to play by Lamar Wright\". \"Damarco Minor's 22 points led four Cougars in double figures, and Jonathan Kurtas had his first career double-double (13 pts, 10 rebounds.) \nAfter falling behind 11-3, the Cougars found their game and easily defeated VMI 93-67. Lamar Wright topped four Cougars in double figures with a career-high 24 points. Shamar Wright also had a career-high with 11 assists as SIUE had 19 assists. The Cougars forced 24 turnovers, including 14 steals---the most in the Division I era. They also hit a season-best 33 field goals, with their 13 3-pointers being the most for an SIUE team since two years ago versus LSU.\nFor their third game in three days, SIUE met Longwood, the hosts of the \"JK54 Classic\" (honoring Longwood All-American Jerome Kersey) and the defending Big South Conference champions. The two teams had tired legs after both had won their first two tourney games, but both brought their strong defenses to the game.. Longwood took an early lead, but the Cougars fought to an 8 point halftime lead. SIUE led by as many as 11 points before the home team went on a ten point run to take a three-point lead, but the Cougars retook the lead and held on for a 61-56 win. Ray'Sean Taylor led all scorers with 15 points, and his 11 first half points led to the SIUE halftime lead. Damarco Minor scored all of his 9 points in the second half and was a major factor in the Cougars hanging on for the win. The victory snapped Longwood's 15-game home court winning streak and earned the Cougars the program's first tournament title since defeating Longwood in the 2010 Las Vegas Classic, the two schools' only previous meeting.\nCougar redshirt-sophomore guard Ray'Sean Taylor is one of 50 players from the 21 so-called \"mid-major\" conferences named to the \"Lou Henson Award Watch List\". The \"Lou Henson National Player of the Year Award\" is given annually to the top mid-major player in NCAA Division I college basketball and is named after the late former Illinois and New Mexico State head coach, who won 775 games in 41 seasons. and remains the winningest coach in both schools' histories.\nIt was a defensive battle with two teams shutting down the other's offence as the Cougars visited the Kansas City Roos. SIUE took a 2 point halftime lead on a slam dunk by Jonathan Kurtas at the buzzer. SIUE's shooting percentage was only 32% for the game after going only 28% in the first half. The Cougars, however, picked up the majority of the many missed shots, besting one of the best rebounding teams in the nation 47-41. SIUE garnered nine steals and forced 15 turnovers, generating 21 points off turnovers. The Cougars took their first 10-point lead on a three-pointer with 5:08 to play by Shamar Wright, only to see the Roos go on an eight point run. In the final two and a half minutes, SIUE finished on a 9-1 run while holding Kansas City to only a single free throw, to close out the 64-54 win. Shamar Wright led the Cougars in scoring, with 16 points, to go with eight rebounds and three steals. Damarco \"Polo\" Minor added 13 points, and DeeJuan Pruitt scored seven points while taking down in 10 rebounds---his third double-digit rebounding game of the young season. The victory gave SIUE its first 4-game road winning streak of the Division I era, and their 5-2 record is the program's best Division I season's opening.\nThe Cougars beat St. Ambrose 89-54 in only their second home game of the season. It was the team's fifth consecutive win and its sixth non-conference win of the season--- both high marks in SIUE's Division I era.. Four SIUE players scored in double figures, and three others just missed that goal, each scoring at least eight points. Terrance Thompson's career-high 15 points led the team. He was 7-9 from the field and added 4 rebounds, 2 assists and 2 steals. Ray'Sean Taylor scored 13 points and had 6 rebounds and 4 assists. Lamar Wright scored 12 points, striking early on his first three shots from three-point range. Damarco Minor had 10 points, 4 rebounds, an assist, and 2 steals. In all, twelve Cougars saw game action and added to their statistical totals.\nSIUE and Troy were both 6-2 before their Saturday afternoon game. The Trojans scored the first basket, but the Cougars scored the next nine points and never trailed again. When Ray'Sean Taylor sank a three pointer with 7:39 left before halftime, the home team took its largest lead at 12 points. SIUE had a 41-34 halftime lead, but the Alabama team's pressure caused two quick turnovers as the second half began, shaving the lead to only three. Several times, the Cougars then stretched the lead, only to see the visitors move closer. As time closed down to 10 minutes left in the game, Troy scored eight straight points to tie the score on a three-point shot. The home team stretched their lead once more, only to see the visitors close the gap to 65-64 at the five-minute mark. The Cougars then allowed no more and outscored Troy 13-8 for the hectic remainder of the game. Ray'Sean Taylor led the game in scoring (21) and rebounding (8). This was his first 20-point scoring job of the year and the 10th of his career. Three other Cougars hit double digit scoring--- Damarco Minor- 17 with 4 assists and 3 steals, Lamar Wright - 14 with 3 3-pointers, and Shamar Wright -13. SIUE began the game among the top 35 in the NCAA in turnovers forced and forced 17 from Troy, turning them into 25 points. The Cougars now have a six-game winning streak--- the longest for SIUE since the 2005-06 (Division II) season. Their now-seven nonconference wins is also a program high since the school joined the Ohio Valley Conference.\nRay'Sean Taylor's last second over-the-shoulder shot went in, but the final buzzer sounded while it was still in the air, and the Bradley Braves won 56-54 to stop the SIUE win streak at six games while extending their own to four. The Cougars came out strong, shooting 54% in the first half, for an eight point halftime lead. The second half was another story. Bradley began with 13 unanswered points, helped by three Cougar turnovers. After giving up the lead, SIUE played the visitors fairly even for the rest of the game, but they were never able to regain the lead. Nine Cougar players saw action, but DeeJuan Pruitt missed his third game due to illness.\nFor their second consecutive Missouri Valley Conference opponent, the Cougars visited the Illinois State Redbirds for their \"Return to Horton\" Fieldhouse to honor ISU alumnus Doug Collins. The home team scored the first basket before SIUE reeled off nine unanswered points. ISU battled back, but SIUE held onto their lead, going into halftime up 34-33. The Redbirds again scored first in the second half and went out to a six point lead before the Cougars ran off a 12-2 run to take a four point lead. The two teams went back and forth from halfway through the second half until 3:44 remaining, when ISU took its final lead. They stretched it out to as many as seven points. Then it was SIUE scores, SIUE fouls, ISU shoots free throws, and repeat, and repeat with the Redbirds winning 77-71. Despite losing, four Cougars scored in double figures; Ray'Sean Taylor' - 20, Shamar Wright -12, Terrance Thompson -11, Jonathan Kurtas -10.\nThe Division III Scarlet Hawks of IIT, coached by former Cougar Terrance \"T.J.\" Gray, visited First Community Arena. The visitors held their own during the first half of the first half, taking the lead three times by as many as four points. Then, the Cougars defense clamped down, and they started hitting their shots, with a streak of eleven made shots while going 13 for 15 in the last ten minutes of the half, and SIUE led by as many as 16 on the way to a 51-40 halftime lead. Fourteen years after graduating, T.J. Gray still holds the SIUE record for 3 point baskets in a season, and his team played the same way, shooting 15-32 from outside the line to keep the Cougars from blowing them out of the gym. The home team was 10-23 on 3's, while shooting an overall 59% for the game. They tied their season high for points and tied the school record of 11 blocked shots in a game. Twelve Cougars saw game action (including DeeJuan Pruitt after missing four games), and all twelve scored, with five scoring in double figures; Ray'Sean Taylor - 20, Damarco \"Polo\" Minor- 17, both Lamar Wright &amp; Shamar Wright -13, Jonathan Kurtas -10.\nThe visiting Cougars and the Saint Louis Billikens played even, if poorly for the first fourteen minutes, but SIUE then went cold, hitting only one of fourteen shots for the rest of the half, while the home team went on a 12-2 run to take a 33-22 halftime lead. The Cougars opened the second half with an eight point run, only to see the Bills answer with their own 22-7 run for an eighteen (18) point lead with 11:06 left in the game. Then, the Cougars defense went into overdrive, forcing repeated St.Louis turnovers, and the offense started hitting their shots. Slowly, the lead shrank, until DeeJuan Pruitt sank a pair of free throws to tie the game at 66 with only 1:06 remaining. Stymied in the first half, Ray'Sean Taylor scored 9 of his 12 points in the second, including the Cougars' last three to lock up the win. Lamar Wright, shut out in the first, scored 13 second half points, including three of three three pointers. Ray'Sean Taylor led SIUE with a career high 21 points and took down 9 rebounds. Damarco Minor added 12 points, while Shamar Wright led the team with 4 assists and a career-high 12 rebounds. The Cougars' nine nonconference wins is the most as a Division I team, and the 9-4 record is the best season start for SIUE since the 2006-07 team was also 9-4.\nIn their conference opener, SIUE and Tennessee Tech played even for the first ten minutes. Then the Cougars stepped it up and took a ten point halftime lead. Tech's Golden Eagles came out with an eight point run to open the second half. SIUE again stepped up their game, answering Tech's run with a nine point run of their own. After that, the Cougars never led by less than nine, leading by as much as 17 and winning 64-51. Shamar Wright led the team with 18 points to go with five rebounds, three steals and four blocked shots. Ray'Sean Taylor scored 14 points and grabbed eight rebounds. while DeeJuan Pruitt' led the team with nine rebounds and scored 13 points. Terrance Thompson played only 12 minutes coming off the bench but scored eight points and had four rebounds. The win moves the SIUE record to 10-4, winning three straight and nine of its last 11 games. The 10-4 starts is the best for SIUE at the Division I level, and it is the earliest the Cougars have won 10 games since the 2004-05DeeJu team won its 10th game on December 19.\nThe Cougars shoot only 35% from the field during the first half at Southeast Missouri State but stayed within five points at halftime by going 11-11 from the free throw line. In the second half, SUIE upped its shooting to 46%, but allowed SEMO to lead by as many as 10 points on the way to an 82-73 win by missing ten of twentythree second half free throws and committing 15 turnovers for the game, including three in the last minute. Ray'Sean Taylor was tops of four Cougars scoring in double figure with 23 points. Lamar Wright had 12 points, and Shamar Wright and Damarco Minor both had 10, with Minor scoring all of his points on free throws.\nLast season, Tennessee State beat SIUE three times and ended the Cougars' season in the first round of the OVC tournament. Opening with a 9-0 run, SIUE led this year's first rematch from start to finish. Each time the Tigers got close, the Cougars answered and widened the gap. SIUE led 40-34 at halftime. Answering TSU's challenges, the Cougars looked to be taking a decisive lead at 61-49 and their largest lead of the night, but the Tigers put on a 15-5 run that closed the score to 66-64 with four minutes left. The home team then allowed only four points in the next three minutes, while sinking free throw after free throw to extend the score to the final nine point margin and win the game 81-72. Both DeeJuan Pruitt' and Damarco Minor had \"double doubles\" for the game. Minor topped the scoring with 18 points and had 10 rebounds. Pruit had 13 rebound to go with his 16 points. Lamar Wright and Shamar Wright added 13 and 10 points. Ray'Sean Taylor and Terrance Thompson each added nine points. Taylor, having an off night shooting, led the team in assists, including two alley-oop passes to Pruitt.\nIt was the first meeting between SIUE and new OVC rival Southern Indiana since 2008. Striving to maintain its unbeaten home record, the Screaming Eagles hit five three-pointers early in the game for a 19-15 lead. The Cougars then scored ten straight for a 25-19 lead. After shutting down USI's long-distance shooting SIUE had a 35-29 halftime lead. The Cougars built their lead to fifteen at 57-42 before the home team had runs of 11-2 and 8-2 to get close, but the visitors held on for a 69-62 win. Damarco Minor had his second consecutive \"double double\" with career highs of 26 points and 11 rebounds and was a perfect 15-15 at the free throw line. Ray'Sean Taylor and DeeJuan Pruitt' scored 12 and 10 points. This was the Cougars twelfth win of the season, tying SIUE's record for most wins as a Division I team.\nOn January 9, the Ohio Valley Conference named Damarco Minor both the \"OVC Player of the Week\" and the \"OVC Newcomer of the Week\" for his play in games against Tennessee State and Southern Indiana.\nSIUE rolled over Eastern Illinois 80-62 for its 13th win this season, the school's most wins in Division I. The two teams played even for the first half, but the Cougars opened the second with a 10-0 run. With their sixth win in seven game, SIUE took sole possession of first place in the OVC. Damarco Minor went to the free throw line with 4:23 left in the first and hit the first of two shots for his 47th consecutive free throw, setting the OVC record before missing his second shot, his first miss since the fourth game of the season. The Cougars took its first double-digit lead 48-37 with 14:48 to play on consecutive 3-pointers by Shamar Wright, and the Cougars kept a double-digit lead for the rest of the game as Wright scored 14 points. DeeJuan Pruitt continued his domination of the Panthers with his sixth career double-double--- a career-high 24 points and tying his season high 13 rebounds. EIU had pulled to within 11 when Minor was fouled with 9:34 to play; EIU coach Marty Simmons (a former SIUE head coach) disputed the call enough to earn a technical foul, and Minor hit all four free throws to push the Cougar lead to 61-46. Minor's 12 points and Ray'Sean Taylor's 11 gave the Cougars four scorers in double figures, with Lamar Wright missing a free throw for his tenth point immediately before fouling out. Taylor led the team with a season high 6 assists, \"...big time,\" coach Brian Barone declared.\nLocated only 32 miles apart, their first meeting as Ohio Valley Conference opponents was their first since 2005, when SIUE was in Division II and Lindenwood in the NAIA. The Cougars led from start to finish in the 68-58 win, but the Lions kept them close in front of SIUE's largest home crowd of the season. The home team took several double digit leads (by as many as 14 points), but the visitors kept closing the gap. Ray'Sean Taylor led the Cougars with 18 points and five assists. Damarco Minor scored 16 and had nine rebounds. Shamar Wright added 11 points and five rebounds. Double-teamed the entire game, DeeJuan Pruitt scored only five points but got his season high thirteen rebounds for the third time.\nThe Morehead State Eagles were the preseason pick to win the OVC championship. They traveled to Edwardsville to show the league-leading SIUE Cougars why. The Eagles shot 56% with six 3 pointers to take a ten point halftime lead. Ray'Sean Taylor's season high 24 points and DeeJuan Pruitt's 11 could not offset the five Morehead State players in double figures. \"There was a level of frustration throughout the game,\". SIUE Head Coach Brian Barone said. \"You feel like you string two or three plays together and it is still an eight or nine point game.\" Morehead shot 47 percent both from the field (22 of 46) and from the three-point line (9 of 19), while SIUE hit only 38 percent (20 of 52) from the field while being a perfect 11 of 11 from the free-throw line. Despite having their four game win streak snapped, the Cougars remain in first place in the OVC.\nThe Southern Indiana Screaming Eagles avenged its home loss to the Cougars by jumping to an 8-0 opening lead and hit eight first-half three-pointers to take a 38-22 halftime lead. SIUE shot only 35 percent for the game, while ISU shot 44. The Screaming Eagles held a double digit lead through most of the game. The Cougars able to close to only six points with just over two minutes left to play, but the visitors held on for the 82-72 win. SIUE was led in scoring with 19 points by both Ray'Sean Taylor and Shamar Wright. DeeJuan Pruitt's seventh career double-double with 10 points and a season-high 15 rebounds was more than offset by USI's Jacob Polakovich scoring 16 points and pulling down 23 rebounds while two other Eagles outscored him. The Cougars remain in first place in the OVC but are now in a six-way tie.\nThirty points and five steals by Ray'Sean Taylor and DeeJuan Pruitt's eighth career double-double were not enough to hold off hot shooting Tennessee Tech, who gave the Cougars their third consecutive loss.\nThe Cougars had a ten point lead midway through the second half when Morehead State's Mark Freeman scored 14 straight points as the Eagles 16-1 run put them in the lead on the way to handing SIUE its fourth straight loss.\nHosting OVC co-leader Tennessee Martin, the Cougars opened with a 14-2 blitz and never looked back on the way to snapping their four game losing streak. Ray'Sean Taylor again led the way with 27 points and 10 rebounds for his first double-double of the season, adding four assists and two steals to his stat line. Damarco Minor scored sixteen, and Shamar Wright scored his 1,000th career point on the way to his 15. DeeJuan Pruitt added another double-double with 11 points and 13 rebounds. The Skyhawks tried to get closer, but the Cougars repeatedly held them at bay, leading by as many as 28 before UT Martin was able to close to the final margin.\nIn the first ever meeting between the Cougars and the Little Rock Trojans, SIUE shot 56 percent (32-57) for the game and 47 percent (10-21) 3-point range, but the home team kept dropping 3s of their own (13-25). The Cougars led by as many as 15 with 16:19 to play, but the Trojans kept hitting their shots, cutting the margin to only five points with just over five minutes to go. With the score down to 81-79, Lamar Wright was intentionally fouled on a breakaway, but only a shooting foul was called on the intentional shove the pushed him off the floor. He missed both free throws, and the rebounder was fouled, then sinking two frees to tie the game 81-81 with only 2.1 seconds left. Shamar Wright inbounded to Ray'Sean Taylor at the far free throw line. Taylor took one dribble and put up a sixty foot shot that hit the back of the rim and dropped through the net for the 84-81 win. Damarco Minor led four Cougars in double figures with 23 points. Taylor had 21, DeeJuan Pruitt 13, and Shamar Wright 12.\nFor only the second time this season, the Cougars won after trailing at halftime. Lindenwood started out 12-2 and was up 16-5 just nine minutes into the game as SIUE suffered through a spate of unforced turnovers. After getting their act together, the Cougars closed to 30-28 at the break,and tied the game with the first basket of the second half, a DeeJuan Pruitt layup. SIUE took the lead at 38-36 with 16:21 to play and never trailed on the way to the 63-58 win. Damarco Minor had his fourth double-double with a game-high 19 points and 11 rebounds, and DeeJuan Pruitt had his sixth double-double of the season with 11 points and 12 rebounds after being held scoreless in the first half. Ray'Sean Taylor contributed 11 points, five rebounds and three assists. Lamar Wright and Terrance Thompson each scored seven points, with Wright adding four rebounds and a block and Thompson two rebounds and a block. The Cougars improved to 17-9 overall, 8-5 in the OVC, and 7-6 on the road--- all three victory marks are program highs in Division I.\nThe Eastern Illinois Panthers shot .567 from the field and .538 from 3 point range, and the Cougars were unable to counter, as Eastern fired shot after shot that swished through the nets. As SIUE fell to 17-10 overall and 8-6 in the OVC, Damarco Minor again led the scoring with 19 points. Shamar Wright added 17 and DeeJuan Pruitt 12.\nBoth teams started slowly but picked up the pace as the Cougars visited Tennessee Martin. SIUE ended up with a strong showing, but the home team came out on top, 90-84. Damarco Minor again led the scoring with 20 points, his fifth 20 point game of the season. Ray'Sean Taylor scored 18 points, with 13 in the second half. DeeJuan Pruitt had his seventh double-double performance this season with 12 points and 10 rebounds. Jalen Hodge added 13 points, one off his high as a Cougar.\nThe Cougars and Tennessee State started out pretty much playing even, but the Tigers' Junior Clay was on fire, scoring 40 points as he led his team to a 100-85 win. Shamar Wright led SIUE with a season-high 20 points as he moved up to No. 11 on SIUE's all-time scoring list. Ray'Sean Taylor added 17, Damarco Minor 15, and DeeJuan Pruitt 11.\nRoster.\nSource \nSchedule and results.\nSource= \n!colspan=12 style=| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=| Non-conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Ohio Valley Conference regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| Ohio Valley Conference Tournament"

The ground has hosted the men's final twice in 2000, 2013, and hosted the 2021 Men's Final as well. It was confirmed as the venue to host the final on 10 June 2020, when the fixture for the event was released.\nThe ground is often used for major rugby league matches, being the primary venue for the annual Super League Grand Final, which is the championship-deciding game of Britain's Super League competition, and top-tier test matches such as the Kangaroo tour and the now-defunct Four Nations.\nThe ground is the home stadium of English football team Manchester United, and has a capacity of 74,310, which makes it the largest club football stadium (second-largest football stadium overall after Wembley Stadium, and third largest on total with the rugby union Twickenham Stadium coming in second) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe.\nPost match.\nMen's final.\nThe women's final was played as a double header men's final for the first time in the tournament's history."

        "text": "The final of the 2021 Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup was one of three finals of the integrated 2021 Rugby League World Cup (postponed and held in 2022). It was played at Manchester Central Convention Complex in Manchester on 18 November 2022, the day before the men's and women's finals.\nEngland beat France 28–24 to win their second title.\nBackground.\nEngland and France were the two top-rated teams in the IRL Wheelchair World Rankings going into the tournament. They were in separate groups for the group stage matches. England won the first tournament in 2008, with France defeating England in the final of the two other tournaments in 2013 and 2017.\nRoute to the final.\nBoth France and England topped their groups with three-figure points differences, having each won all three of their group matches. France won their semi-final against Australia by over 40 points, while England won theirs against Wales by over 100 points.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match was tight throughout, with the teams matching each other try-for-try in the first half, the only difference in points coming with penalty kicks and conversions, France leading by two points at half time. During the second half, the scores were levelled and then, with quick successive penalties for both sides, levelled again. Three minutes before the end of the match, England captain Tom Halliwell scored a try to give his team the lead, which they held on to until the final klaxon.\nEngland captain Tom Halliwell was named the player of the match, with England's Seb Bechara winning the Golden Boot for the tournament.\nPost match.\nThe next day, the England team celebrated their victory at Old Trafford with the Australian men's and women's teams following their victories in their respective finals.\nControversies.\nReferee behaviour.\nWheelchair rugby league uses two principal referees, one for attack and one for defence. The defence referee, Frenchman Laurent Abrial, was criticised for a lack of professionalism throughout the match, making controversial calls against England; openly disagreeing with other officials' calls; \"throwing a tantrum\"; and being seen to rile up the crowd. \"League Unlimited\" felt that Abrial's behaviour \"overshadowed what was a great game of football\", while \"The Examiner\" instead said that Halliwell's late try to win the match overshadowed the behaviour, though noted Abrial soured the major event. During the winners' ceremony, Abrial was booed by the crowd. The live commentary team described him as a \"pantomime villain\". Journalists; players; commentators; and other referees gave criticisms of Abrial's behaviour on Twitter, with fans using the social media platform to call for disciplinary action.\nIn the days after the final, it was announced that Abrial's behaviour was under official review by the International Rugby League (IRL), to determine whether there should be a misconduct investigation. On 21 November 2022 the French Rugby League Federation announced that Abrial is suspended from all refereeing duties until the IRL investigation is complete.\nOn 9 June 2023 it was announced that Abrial had been suspended for three years until the start of the 2026 season following the conclusion of the investigation. The International Rugby League misconduct committee concluded he had \"brought the game into disrepute through unacceptable behaviour\".\nLegacy.\n\"The Guardian\" wrote that wheelchair rugby league \"felt like the world's best-kept secret\", given its anonymity before the 2021 World Cup and its sudden large popularity among sport fans watching for the first time due to its mainstream television broadcast; England coach Tom Coyd said the response was unbelievable and that he could see the sport \"going to explode\". It was also suggested that the inclusivity, with people able to start playing as beginners at any age and ability level, contributed to the forecasted uptake in the sport. Current and former England players also reflected on the media interest and popularity, and wanting to continue to build on the legacy following the win.\nThe final had a world record attendance for a wheelchair rugby league match, with an official figure of 4,526. It was reported that there was a television audience of millions."

        "text": "Tech Deck Skateboarding is a Game Boy Color game developed by Handheld Games and released in 2001, based upon the Tech Deck brand of fingerboard skateboard toys.\nGameplay.\n\"Tech Deck Skateboarding\" features over 40 levels, consisting of 10 unique skate parks each with 4 courses. The player is required to collect 50 Tech Deck skateboards, featuring designs from brands such as Birdhouse and Zero. Gameplay is trick-based, requiring players to navigate obstacles and fixtures such as half-pipes and rails across courses. Courses are time-limited and performing tricks provides the player with more time to uncover new Tech Deck boards. There are three difficulty levels to complete, and a free-play mode for players to navigate courses without a time limit. \nReception.\n\"Tech Deck Skateboarding\" received mixed reviews. Positive reviews focused upon the simplicity and accessibility of the gameplay, with Frank Provo of \"GameSpot\" praising the \"great deal of gameplay\" which is \"quick to pick up, easy to learn, hard to master, and quite painless - enabling players of all ages and skill levels to enjoy the game\". \nNegative reviews of \"Tech Deck Skateboarding\" focused on the game's repetitive gameplay and limited playtime. Jon Griffith of \"IGN\", who dismissed the game as \"extremely bad\", stated the \"collection-based gameplay wears thin quickly\", noting the limited motivation behind collecting the \"flat, unimpressive reproductions\" of Tech Deck boards. Frank Provo of GameSpot conceded that \"Even on the X-Treme difficulty level, most players will acquire all 40 boards in a matter of one to two hours.\" \"Nintendo Power\" stated \"the play control is inaccurate and unintuitive. The game itself is incredibly boring.\""

        "title": "1996 UST Growling Tigers basketball team",
        "text": "The 1996 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 59th season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 1996–97 began on July 13, 1996, and the host school for the season was De La Salle University.\nThey defeated the De La Salle Green Archers for the third straight year in a Finals series to achieve a four-peat for the second time in 46 years after winning them from 1946 to 1949. The 1996 title brought their total championships to 17, making them the second winningest team in the league. Third-year forward Estong Ballesteros was selected to the Mythical team at the tournament's presentation of awards.\nSchedule and results.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format. All games were aired on PTV 4 by Silverstar Sports.\nSummary.\nThe UST community had adopted the slogan “Fourward” in support of the team's quest for a record-tying four-peat immediately after the Tigers won their third straight championship the past season. Their drive was reinforced in the preseason when they won the National Seniors and the Father Martin Cup championships. Veteran coach Aric del Rosario had built this year's team around reigning MVP Chris Cantonjos, who was the last remaining player from the undefeated 1993 Growling Tigers team. He, along with Estong Ballesteros, Richard Yee, Dale Singson, Henry Ong, and Chandler Donaldson honed their skills in the off-season while playing in the Philippine Basketball League.\nFirst round.\nThe Tigers lost their 43–35 eight-point lead in the second half when the Warriors began a 7–0 run. They were able to pull away after a string of turnovers by UE and basket conversions by Ballesteros off assists from Singson and Gelo Velasco yielded eight unanswered points to increase their lead at 51–42 with 5:25 remaining in the game.\nThe first half saw the Tigers erect a 22–11 lead, but the Warriors rallied back to bring down the deficit to six at the end of the half. Reigning MVP Chris Cantonjos led UST with 15 points and 4 rebounds.\nAteneo pulled away with a 66–62 win after the Tigers’ big men fouled out late in the game. UST was leading, 55–54 when Cantonjos committed his fifth and final foul with 3:37 left. The score has been close until the last 2:10 when the Eagles made their move behind John Verayo's efforts, first, by converting both free throws off a Richard Melencio foul for a 61–58 lead; and then a steal off Singson that led to a fast break and a layup by teammate Gabby Cui. Melencio was able to score from under the basket to move within three at 60–63, but Ballesteros got called for his fifth foul in the last 0:43 during a rebounding tussle with Verayo.\nThe Tigers defeated the NU Bulldogs, 78–59 even as they missed the services of Yee, Donaldson, and Francis Mangyao who had suffered from various injuries. The team relied on the collective rebounding of Cantonjos, Melencio, and Gerard Francisco to deny the Bulldogs from scoring second-chance points. They broke away from their nine-point 38–29 halftime lead when the quartet of Singson, Melencio, Cantonjos, and Ong orchestrated a 16–4 run to put the game out of their opponents’ reach. Melencio led in scoring with a game-high of 16 points.\nHardly missing the still-injured Yee, Mangyao and Donaldson, the Tigers won against UP by a blowout lead of 26 points. The score was tied at 43–all at the 8:44 mark of the second half before Singson and Velasco each shot a three-pointer to ignite a 20–9 run for a 63–50 lead. Cantonjos finished with 24 points to go with his 13 rebounds.\nUST won their third straight game when they defeated Adamson, 80–65 behind Ballesteros’ game-high of 30 points. The Tigers led, 40–36 at the half, until Ballesteros sparked a 14–7 rally at the 12:40 mark to pull his team to 54–43.\nWith Cantonjos sitting out due to a stress fracture on his right hand, the Tigers lost against FEU, 64–67. Singson topscored for UST with 16 points.\nThe Tigers suffered their second straight loss at the hands of La Salle by three points in a game that went into overtime. Ballesteros topscored for UST with 21 points.\nSecond round.\nUST's four wins and three losses in the first round put them in a tie at third place with Ateneo and behind La Salle and the UP Fighting Maroons’ 5–2 record.\nInjuries continued to hound the Tigers as Cantonjos and Donaldson sat out, forcing the still-recuperating Richard Yee to suit up to relieve forwards Ballesteros and rookie Mel Latoreno. The Falcons staged a late rally in the last two minutes in an effort to surmount UST's 10-point advantage, but the Tigers were able to keep them at bay until time ran out. Francisco and Ballesteros scored 19 and 18 points respectively.\nDale Singson's endgame heroics prevented the NU Bulldogs from staging a late-game comeback. The starting point guard converted three free throws and made back-to-back steals in the last 18 seconds to give the Tigers an 11–4 scoring advantage for a 74–64 win. The team continued to miss the services of their two centers, with Donaldson being ruled out for the remainder of the season due to a slipped disc, and Cantonjos still suffering from dizziness.\nThe Tigers avenged their first-round loss to FEU with a 79–74 win, but they were still reeling from the absences of their big men. Camtonjos, who had been suffering from dizziness had to be literally plucked out from the UST Hospital to play in place of Mel Latoreno, who was part of the Philippines' U-18 team that left for the ABC tournament in Malaysia. The Tigers regrouped from a turnover-filled first half to mount a 17–9 run by Cantonjos, Ballesteros, and Yee for a 58–45 lead.\nCoach Aric del Rosario heaved a sigh of relief as the Tigers benefitted from the return to form of his two starters. Richard Yee has recovered from his bout with hepatitis, while Dale Singson's sprained left thigh has finally healed. The veteran coach was pleased with how the team was able to run and execute their plays.\nHenry Ong scored 14 of his 17 points the first half with three three-point shot conversions that helped his team erect a commanding 27-point lead over UE.\nDale Singson towed the Tigers to a down-to-the-wire victory for the second time in the second round since his endgame performance against the NU Bulldogs on August 28. Trailing UP at 66–71 in the last 33 seconds of the game, UST was able to pull close with free throw conversions by Yee, Cantonjos, and Ballesteros to put the game within one at 70–71. Singson was able to steal off UP's Jasper Javier and convert on a drive for the win as time expired.\nUST could not get their perimeter shooting going as La Salle repeated their win over the Tigers in the second round. The Archers took the solo spot at first place from being tied with UST prior to the game with identical 9–3 records. The score was tied at 54–all at the 8:57 mark in the second half when La Salle's Chris Tan made two successive baskets. The Tigers were unable to score as the Archers pulled ahead, 65–54.\nThe Tigers broke free from a 75–all deadlock with a 9–4 run that started with Dale Singson's jump shot and followed by a layup by Henry Ong. Ateneo cane close to within three at 79–76 in the last 56 seconds, but UST was able to force back-to-back turnovers, the first resulting to a three-point play by Cantonjos, and then a two-point conversion to end the game at 84–79.\nFinal Four.\nHolding a twice-to-beat advantage over the third-seeded UP Fighting Maroons, the Tigers came out with a 63–56 win to advance to the Finals. Coming from a 12-point halftime lead, UST relied on steady free throw shooting from Gerard Francisco to pull away after UP's Paolo Mendoza fired a three-point shot to cut down the lead to five at 59–54 in the last 40 seconds.\nFinals.\nEven as UST is seeded second behind La Salle, and have lost both their head-to-head elimination games, analysts have tabbed them as the favorites to win the championship. The Archers’ Jong Uichico, who was coaching a collegiate team in the Finals for the first time in his career, will be relying on a group of young players who equally have no prior championship experience. Del Rosario begged to differ, citing injuries on his players during the eliminations have lowered their chances in the Finals. He motivated his players by emphasizing the opportunity to make history in the UAAP with winning a fourth consecutive title.\nThe Tigers’ defense prevented La Salle from scoring at will in the last 10 minutes. In contrast, UST had a great game with their shooting, with nine of Henry Ong's 17 points coming from three-point shots. Down by five points at 44–49, they were able to execute a 12–0 run at the 5:36 mark to give their team a 56–49 lead.\nUST went scoreless for eight minutes in the first half, which ended with La Salle leading, 26–21. They began the second half with a 5–0 run behind Dale Singson's three-point shot and an eight-foot Pull-up jumper on a transition fast break to tie the score. The two teams traded baskets until the Archers pulled away after Tyrone Bautista made a three-point shot to put his team ahead by nine points with six minutes left. The Tigers next scored nine unanswered points which was capped by Henry Ong's three-point shot in the last 2:23 to tie the game at 48-all.\nEstong Ballesteros fouled out in the ensuing play with Bautista making both free throws. Gelo Velasco made back-to-back baskets, first a mid-range shot, and then a three-point shot off a Mark Telan miss, pulling his team ahead by one. A foul by Ong sent Bautista to the line anew, making both free throws again for a La Salle lead. Ong, in turn drove and converted with a foul from Bautista for a three-point play in the last 33 seconds. He made the bonus shot for a three-point lead. Telan missed a three-point attempt but was fouled by Cantonjos in the rebound, giving possession to La Salle. Chris Tan converted on a drive and Dino Aldeguer hurriedly fouled Ong at the inboud to stop the game clock. He split his free throws, giving the Archers a chance to tie after Don Allado collared the rebound, but Dale Singson was able to steal the ball from Bautista who was driving down the basket with 11.7 seconds left. Telan fouled him in the 9.2 mark. Singson missed both free throws as Telan got the rebound, but La Salle missed two successive three point shots by Bautista and Tan as time ran out. UST won, 57–54.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nEstong Ballesteros was picked fourth overall in the 1997 PBA draft by the Chito Narvasa-led Formula Shell Zoom Masters team on January 19, 1997. Chris Cantonjos, meanwhile, was one of the six players elevated by the Tanduay Centennial Rhum team to the PBA from the Philippine Basketball League in 1999."

        "title": "Equestrian Statue of Leopold II, Brussels",
        "text": "The Equestrian Statue of Leopold II (; ) is a bronze equestrian statue erected in Brussels, Belgium, in memory of King Leopold II, second King of the Belgians. It was created by the sculptor Thomas Vinçotte in 1914, but it was not finalised until 1926 by the architect François Malfait, when it was inaugurated in honour of the king.\nThe statue stands on the /, to the south-east of the Royal Palace of Brussels, at the point where the / joins the / (Small Ring), and a few tens of metres from the Royal Stables of Brussels. It is also close to \"Matongé\", an African (mainly Congolese) district of Ixelles. This area is served by Brussels-Central railway station, as well as by the metro stations Parc/Park (on lines 1 and 5) and Trône/Troon (on lines 2 and 6).\nHistory.\nKing Leopold II died in 1909, and as for many Kings of the Belgians, the Belgian authorities took the initiative, in 1914, to erect a statue in his honour. To do this, the Belgian State collected more than 625,000 Belgian francs. On 31 May 1914, the Belgian official journal and the press launched an appeal for anyone who wanted to contribute to erecting the statue. The initiative was successful, in which even Leopold's successor, King Albert I, himself took part and responded to the appeal along with some citizens.\nThe statue's construction, however, was delayed due to the First World War and it is necessary to wait until the end of the war for the work to be redesigned by the sculptor Thomas Vinçotte with the help of the architect François Malfait and the \"Union Minière du Haut-Katanga\" which, for its part, provided the raw material. The bronze statue was cast by the \"Compagnie des Bronzes de Bruxelles\" and was inaugurated on 15 November 1926, the feast day of the dynasty, but also the patronal feast of Leopold II. This ceremony was marked by the presence of the entire Belgian royal family and the authorities who came in procession to the scene.\nControversies.\nSince the 21st century, the statue has aroused many controversies as to its presence in the centre of Brussels since the figure of Leopold II is no longer as admired and respected as at the time of its construction. Indeed, it is today mainly associated with Belgian colonial history and the Congo Free State, a territory over which Leopold exercised \"de facto\" sovereignty from 1885 to 1908.\nThe statue has been vandalised several times with red and white paint, including by the writer and activist Théophile de Giraud in 2008. In June 2020, a petition for its removal was signed over 45,000 times within several days. A majority in the Brussels Parliament wants to either recontextualise or remove all Leopold II statues in Brussels, including this one."

        "text": "The 2023 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 2, 2023, at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The 109th annual Rose Bowl, the game featured Penn State from the Big Ten Conference and Utah from the Pac-12 Conference. The game began at 2:11p.m. PST and was aired on ESPN and ESPN Radio. It was one of the 2022–23 bowl games concluding the 2022 FBS football season. Sponsored by Prudential Financial, the game is officially known as The Rose Bowl Game presented by Prudential.\nThis game was the final Rose Bowl with its conference tie in of Pac 12 vs Big Ten before the expansion of the College Football Playoff to 12 teams in 2024 (2025 Calendar year) and hosting the final four team playoff semifinal in 2023 (2024 Calendar year).\nInduction ceremonies to the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame were held before the game honoring three-time Rose Bowl Game head coach Hugo Bezdek (1884–1952), recently retired Rose Bowl Stadium CEO Darryl Dunn, 1977 Rose Bowl Game MVP Vince Evans (USC), and 1987 All-American Lorenzo White (Michigan State).\nTeams.\nBased on conference tie-ins, the game featured Big Ten Conference team Penn State and Pac-12 Conference champion Utah. Utah earned their spot by defeating #4 USC in the Pac-12 Championship by a score of 47–24 on December 2. Penn State earned their spot after Ohio State and Michigan made it to the College Football Playoff. This was Utah's second consecutive Rose Bowl, with an appearance in last year's edition against the Ohio State Buckeyes, while this was Penn State's 5th overall Rose Bowl game, most recently playing in the 2017 edition against the USC Trojans.\nThis game marked the Nittany Lions' 100th anniversary of their first Rose Bowl Game. They were defeated by Southern California 14–3 on January 1, 1923. This was the first time Utah and Penn State had ever played each other.\nPenn State Nittany Lions.\nThe Nittany Lions earned their 5th overall Rose Bowl bid after they finished the regular season as the 3rd highest ranked team from the Big Ten Conference. The two higher ranked teams in the Big Ten, Michigan and Ohio State, both reached the College Football Playoff, giving the Nittany Lions the trip to Pasadena. Penn State finished their regular season with an overall 10–2 record, 7–2 in Big Ten play. Their losses came to Michigan and Ohio State in the 7th and 9th weeks of the regular season, respectively.\nUtah Utes.\nAfter winning their second-straight Pac-12 championship, this was the second consecutive Rose Bowl appearance for the Utes, who lost to Ohio State in the 2022 edition. Utah finished their regular season with a 9–3 overall record, 7–2 in Pac-12 play. Their losses came to Florida, UCLA (in the same stadium), and Oregon. The Utes faced USC in the Pac-12 Championship, a rematch between the teams. Utah had defeated USC on October 15 by a 43–42 score (USC's only regular season loss), and defeated them again for the Pac-12 title, 47–24. The Utes entered the Rose Bowl with an overall 10–3 record."

He previously played junior in the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) with the Spruce Grove Saints and the United States Hockey League (USHL) with the Fargo Force, as well as NCAA collegiate hockey with the UMass Minutemen.\nPlaying career.\nMurray began his junior career in his hometown of St. Albert, spending three seasons with the St. Albert Sabres of the Alberta Major Bantam Hockey League (AMBHL) and St. Albert Flyers of the Alberta Major Midget Hockey League (AMMHL). He then began in Junior A with the Spruce Grove Saints of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), leading the team to an AJHL championship in 2015 and winning both the AJHL and CJHL Best Goaltender awards for 2015–16.

Murray, posting a career 2.23 goals against average and .916 save percentage, helped the Minutemen to three consecutive Hockey East championships in 2019, 2021, and 2022, with a national championship victory in 2021. In his final season with UMass, Murray was named to the Hockey East Third All-Star team. During this time, Murray gained a degree of notoriety for sharing his name with the then-Pittsburgh Penguins goaltender of the same name, attending the Penguins' rookie camp after his first year at UMass.\nAs an undrafted free agent, Murray signed an amateur tryout contract with the Texas Stars of the American Hockey League (AHL) after his final season at UMass, appearing in eight games across the regular season and playoffs. During the following offseason, Texas signed Murray to a full two-year contract.\nOn October 31, 2022, Murray was signed to a one-year entry-level contract by the Dallas Stars of the National Hockey League (NHL), Texas' major-league affiliate. Shortly afterwards, he was recalled to Dallas' main roster as the result of an injury to starting goaltender Jake Oettinger, with Murray serving as backup to Scott Wedgewood.\nAfter further injuries to Wedgewood, Murray was again recalled to Dallas' roster on February 22, 2023; Murray then made his NHL debut on March 2, earning his first win and saving 19 of 21 shots faced in a 5–2 victory over the Chicago Blackhawks.

        "title": "Nude swimming in US indoor pools",
        "text": "Nude swimming in US indoor pools was common for men and boys from the late 1880s until the early 1970s, but rare for women and girls. For much of that time period, indoor pool use was primarily for physical education or athletic competition, not recreation. Male nude swimming had been customary in natural bodies of water, which was not viewed as a social problem until the 18th century. When the tradition of skinny-dipping in secluded spots had become more visible with urbanization, indoor pools were first built in the 19th century in part to address this issue by moving male swimming indoors. For the first decades of the 20th century, male nude swimming was associated with a trope of the \"old swimming hole\" as representing childhood innocence and adult masculinity. In their own classes, nudity was rare for girls based upon an assumption of modesty, but might include young children. Prepubescent boys might be nude in mixed-gender settings, including the presence of female staff, public competitions, and open houses for families.\nThe primary reason given for nudity by officials was for public health, swimming pools being prone to contamination by water-borne diseases. During the early developmental stages of filtration and chlorination, behavioral measures were also needed to keep the water clean. Because indoor pools were generally male only, the health of swimmers could be monitored most easily by forbidding swimsuits, which often were a source of contamination, while female swimmers wore suits that were more hygienic. As the century continued, more indoor pools were built by local governments, schools and the YMCA, primarily in northern states, to provide year-round swimming as a sport. As with other physical education activities, swimming was gender-segregated. Although aware of the same issues of hygiene, swimming pools in Canada and the United Kingdom more often made nudity for men and boys optional rather than mandatory.\nMale nude swimming in the US remained a common practice in the Midwest and Northeast through the 1950s, but declined in the 1960s due to technological and social changes. After the passage of Title IX in 1972, requiring gender equality in physical education, most schools found mixed-gender use of swimming pools to be the easiest means of compliance. A generation later, nude swimming in public pools as a widespread practice was forgotten, and in the 21st century sometimes denied having existed.\nOrigins of swimming pools.\n\"Swimming baths\" and pools were built in the late 19th century in poorer neighborhoods of northern industrial cities of the US to exert some control over a public swimming culture that offended Victorian sensibilities by including not only nakedness, but roughhousing and swearing. Such behavior had become an issue in the 18th century, but laws prohibiting public indecency had little effect. Naked swimmers from Milwaukee, Wisconsin to New York City, mostly boys and young men, ignored the laws and sometimes flaunted themselves intentionally in view of more upper class passers-by.\nBeginning in 1870, the first public pools in New York City were outdoor \"floating baths\" of wood surrounded by docks that allowed river water to flow through them. In addition to health and hygiene, they were intended to prevent drowning in the open river, which was a frequent occurrence. As the quality of urban river water declined, floating baths became a source of infection. Building indoor pools, and the addition of pools to bathhouses, was done to address this problem. Since few swimmers in these neighborhoods could afford swimsuits or wanted to wear them, nudity among males was taken for granted.\nHistorian Jeff Wiltse writes that in cities such as Philadelphia, Boston, and Milwaukee during the progressive era (1896–1917), indoor and outdoor municipal pools were segregated by gender and class, but often not race. In working class neighborhoods, the white residents were mostly recent immigrants. The pools were for health and exercise, and used by male and female swimmers on alternate days. The outdoor pools were surrounded by a high wall to provide privacy. Women and girls wore bathing costumes, men and boys usually went without. The YMCA pools, which charged a fee and excluded women, were used by middle-class swimmers. The upper classes swam at private health clubs, also male only. At the beginning of the 20th century, nudity for the wealthiest men in New York City was the norm at the University Club, the Yale Club on Vanderbilt Avenue, the Racquet and Tennis Club and the New York Athletic Club on Central Park South. Nude swimming ended after a law was passed in the 1980s banning discrimination against women at private clubs.\nRacial segregation.\nDuring the interwar period, 1918-1939, when many more pools were constructed, public schools and recreation facilities were segregated in the United States, de jure until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, or de facto due to residential patterns. In some cities segregation was maintained by violence against black swimmers who attempted to enter pools.\nPrior to the 1960s, the YMCA built separate facilities in black and white neighborhoods. The first black YMCA with a pool was the Twelfth Street YMCA in Washington, DC which was completed in 1912. Swimming nude was required, but did not appeal to all. In 1942 six agencies in Plainfield, New Jersey offered free swimming lessons at black and white branches of the YMCA and YWCA; the Jewish Community Center, and Watchung Lake. Suits were not required for men and boys at either YMCA.\nIn spite of the Civil Rights Act, a summer camp in Montgomery, Alabama hosted by the YMCA refused entry to two black children in 1969, resulting in a landmark desegregation decision which included the YMCA as a public accommodation. Across the south, municipalities closed recreational facilities rather than integrate them.\nPublic health recommendations.\nAs early as 1914, pool operators and professionals addressed the problem of maintaining the quality of water due to the prevalence of waterborne diseases, including typhoid, dysentery and pneumonia, as well as infections of the eye and ear. Initially civil engineers recommended nudity in indoor pools for all swimmers, male and female, where such rules could be enforced. While this was generally accepted for men, it was true for only some pools when used by women. Fibers from suits clogging pool filters were also given as a reason for nudity. Fibers from wool suits were a greater problem, which was remedied by supplying cotton suits for use by female swimmers.\nIn the 1920s, close monitoring of swimmers in public pools was based upon their being from the working class, having generally poor hygiene and often living in tenements with no bath facilities. Officially, municipal pools were built in working-class neighborhoods to provide such facilities, while YMCAs charged an entry or membership fee that excluded the lower classes, black and white. In 1926, the American Public Health Association (APHA) standards handbook recommended that indoor swimming pools used by men adopt nude bathing policies and that indoor swimming pools used by women require swimsuits \"of the simplest type\". In 1939, swimming coach and college athletics administrator Fred Luehring surveyed the issues and made similar recommendations, advising that men and boys should continue to swim nude, tests of water quality showing the advantage over pools were suits are allowed. He noted the problem of water quality following pool use by female swimmers, not only due to suits being worn but their avoidance of taking a nude shower before entering the pool by showering in their suits. While finding the same public health issues, the National Environmental Health Association recommendations in 1956 included swimmers taking nude showers and wearing only suits laundered and sterilized by the facility, but not nude swimming. \nIn 1940, the wool suits worn by male swimmers continued to be recognized as a source of water contamination. Cotton suits supplied by facilities for female swimmers were a lesser problem, because they could be boiled to decontaminate them. Wool suits cannot be boiled or heated above 105 degrees F. without shrinkage. Wool suits used in salt water cannot be washed effectively, because soap does not lather due to salt residue. In 1941, reviewing the steps taken to maintain good hygiene in pools, H. W. Craig, supervisor of swimming at the University of Illinois, favored the continued conduct of physical education swimming programs for men not wearing suits, and for women using cotton suits supplied by the schools that could be steam cleaned. Problems arose when recreational swimmers used their own suits and avoided showering before entering the pool, which had become more frequent with the movement toward \"corecreational\" swimming.\nFrom 1926 until 1962, every edition of the APHA guidelines recommended nude swimming for males. Given the limits of chlorination and filtration at that time, behavioral measures were also used to maintain water quality. In addition to recommending nudity, all bathers were required to empty their bladder and shower nude before entering the pool. Those suffering from skin or respiratory disease were prohibited from using the pool.\nOutside the United States during the same time period, the issues of hygiene were recognized, but close supervision of swimmers and control of bathing suits was an alternative to nudity. In Canada, public health recommendations allowed for suits, but nudity was recommended in pools used exclusively by men. A brochure sent to parents of children in the Toronto, Ontario school system in 1963 stated that boys participating in the summer education program could swim in bathing trunks or nude. In England, it was recommended that suits for both men and women be inspected and stored by the facility.\nYMCA/YWCA swimming.\nThe first YMCA indoor pool in the United States was built in 1885, in Brooklyn, New York. Male nudity was required at YMCA pools in both the US and Canada until they became mixed-gender in the 1970s. The downtown Miami YMCA, built in 1918 and demolished in 1978, featured what was considered a modern swimming pool at the time. While noting the filtration system made the pool water clean enough to drink, nudity is shown in a promotional photograph from the 1930s. Also in 1930, the Tribune newspaper in Pocatello, Idaho sponsored 'learn to swim' classes at the YMCA, announcing that girls must bring towels and suits, boys only towels. Swim classes at the YMCA for boys only continued into the 1950s, as in Steubenville, Ohio.\nIn Benton Harbor, Michigan local newspapers in June 1941 sponsored a course at the \"Y\" for men over 18 that could not swim, noting in the announcement that no suits were required. Also in Benton Harbor, a program for children in 1943 announced that girls should bring a suit and towel, boys only a towel. The same was true in 1945. However, in 1949 classes had become mixed-gender, so suits were worn.\nAt the YMCA in the South End of Chicago in 1944, a summer program for boys and girls had classes for 500 students in half-hour sessions separated by gender and age. Fridays were family night for adults to see the student's accomplishments. In 1946 when the Tucson, Arizona YMCA pool was used to teach only boys age 9 through junior high, suits were not worn. The YMCA pools were also used for youth competitions. In 1955 the creation of a league of four teams for 8 to 10 year old boys in York, Pennsylvania was announced. The swim meet spectators were limited to male only.\nDuring the transition to gender equality, attempts were made to retain male nudity by limiting access to the pool by women to certain hours, but since they had full membership, this plan was deemed discriminatory. Swimming classes for women and girls (in swimsuits) were held at YWCAs, sometimes in coordination with YMCA classes in the same locality.\nPublic pools.\nBoy's clubs.\nA 1940 article in LIFE magazine describes the pool in the Olneyville Boy's Club as providing an alternative to juvenile delinquency in a declining mill neighborhood. Photos show the naked boys crowded into the \"dingy little 60 ft. swimming pool\" as they had for fifteen years. In 1941 the Olneyville Club won two of the five final events at a national Boys Club of America swimming championship. Following a 1954 cattle judging contest in Wichita Falls, Texas, boys participating were invited to the Wichita Falls Boys Club for a free swim party, no swim suits being needed.\nPublic schools.\nThe 1909 elementary school swimming championship for New York City included nearly forty schools in Manhattan, the Bronx, and Brooklyn; and was held at what was then called the Interior Public Bath, the first municipal indoor swimming pool built in New York City. In the 1920s, schools began building indoor swimming pools for purposes of physical fitness and swimming instruction. In 1900, there were only 67 public pools in the United States; by 1929 there were more than 5,000.\nIn 1935 the school superintendent in Pontiac, Michigan approved nude swim classes for boys in high school, saying it recalled \"the days of the old swimming hole\". In 1940 a New York City school official continued to favor boys wearing bathing suits only in pools visible to both sexes. Girls were issued cotton suits that could be boiled to disinfect them between uses; the wool suits used by boys could not because they would shrink and lose their shape. In addition, fibers from wool swimsuits could clog pool filters. Swim classes were advocated not only for exercise, but as a recreational activity that, once learned, could become a lifelong pursuit. The swim classes were also looked upon as an opportunity to teach children proper hygiene.\nAlthough some advantages in coeducational swim classes were recognized as early as 1934, the need to maintain pool water quality by insuring cleanliness of both swimmers and swimsuits dictated separate boys and girls classes and the banning of wool suits. Few pools had been constructed for coeducation, having a single shower room. In a survey of Indiana high schools in 1939, all boys swim classes were nude, while girls wore suits, 87% being cotton suits issued by the school. Students bringing their own suits was discouraged, the institutions not having control of decontamination. A 1947 survey of schools in northern Utah found more local variation. Only three of the six schools had pools. One allowed swimmers to wear their own suits, one supplied cotton suits. At the one that required nudity, the athletic director cited the problem of lint from suits clogging the pool filter. The October 16, 1950 \"Life\" magazine published a photograph of boys swimming together in the indoor pool of New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois; the caption did not mention they were naked. A southern city with indoor pools in the junior and senior high schools is Houston, Texas, which required nudity until the mid 1960s. While some former students in 2008 remembered the experience as negative, mainly due to bullying, older men who had attended 30 years earlier had no problem, citing different attitudes regarding privacy before WWII.\nIn 1960 school officials and parents began questioning nude swimming in North Tonawanda, New York, where it had been the practice at the high school for 30 years. Rather than a ban on nudity, suits were made optional by a 4-1 vote of the school board. In 1963, as it had for 33 years, the city of Troy, New York continued its mandatory citywide program of swim classes for all students in grades 4-8 and 9-12; boys swimming nude. A letter to parents emphasized the importance of learning at least the basics of swimming for survival in an emergency.\nGirls' classes.\nOne book on public health did agree that nudity would be the most sanitary option for girls as well as boys, and that this was practiced at some schools, but never widespread as with boys. In 1947 the 150 girls age 9 to 13 at the Liberty School in Highland Park, Michigan were directed to wear swimsuits by the Superintendent of Schools in response to a group of mothers protesting to the board of education. Nude swimming for girls had been optional for six weeks prior to the order. Nude swim classes continued for the 200 elementary school girls from two other schools. Boys in the schools had not worn suits in their separate classes for years, and girls requested to do the same in order to give them more time in the pool rather than changing. While following the wishes of parents who believed girls should behave modestly, all the board members disagreed, stating that there was \"no moral issue involved\".\nOther programs for young people.\nYMCA, high school, and college pools in several midwestern states were used during weekends and summer programs for children from the 1930s to the 1960s, announcements noting that boys would not wear suits in indoor pools. The YMCA in Wichita, Kansas was used in 1937 for a 'learn to swim' campaign. The Iowa State College pool in Ames, Iowa was used for children's swim classes in the summer of 1939. The YMCA in Emporia, Kansas was used for a 1939 children's 'learn to swim' campaign. In the summers of 1944 and 1945, the Chicago Parks offered a summer swimming program for children, boys on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday, girls on Thursday and Friday. In two high schools' indoor pools, girls were required to bring a suit, but boys swam without. The Tamalpais High School pool in Mill Valley, California was open to the public three days per week in the summer of 1944. During the days when boys swam in the morning, girls and women in the afternoon, the boys did not wear suits. Boys under 7 were allowed to come to the afternoon sessions with their mothers, but had to bring suits. The University of Oklahoma pool in Norman, Oklahoma was used for summer swim programs, with separate classes for cub scouts and boy scouts. In 1958 the announcement included only the need to bring a towel. In 1961, listed among the attendees for the cub scout sessions were two den mothers.\nThe Sheboygan, Wisconsin Department of Public Recreation held \"Learn to Swim\" classes for middle school children at the Central High School pool. The classes were held on Saturday morning during the school year, Monday through Friday mornings in summer. Among the earliest newspaper announcements of the classes, in 1926 the article ended by saying \"there will be no restrictions on swimming suits.\" In 1930, the announcement more clearly states that girls would be issued suits and towels, boys only towels. The news article in 1940 includes two photographs, one of a girl's class posing in their suits, the other of the boy's class, all nude, watching one student demonstrating a dive.\nThrough the 1950s until 1960, the Sheboygan Press published the schedules of the separate classes for boys and girls, noting that girls would be issued suits, but boys would be nude. A longer article in 1954 included details on the conduct of classes. There were an equal number of boys and girls, 404 in total, age 10 to 14 and divided into 14 half-hour classes each day. There were four teachers, three men and one woman, plus two female locker room attendants. \"Boys swim unhampered by suits and bring only a towel as their contribution each afternoon. Girls bring their own bathing caps and are supplied with suits, for the morning workout\". All swimmers were required to take a soap shower nude before entering the pool. The final class was designated visitor's day, with no mention of boys not being nude with families present. After 1960, all students were required to bring their own suits because mixed-sex recreational sessions had been added to the schedule.\nWaukesha, Wisconsin also conducted classes in 1954 for children age 9 to 11, with boys nude and girls provided suits. The course included Red Cross certification which was conducted by female instructors for both boys and girls.\nColleges and universities.\nIn 1920, a review of swimming pools found similar concerns for hygiene at the collegiate level. \"In men's pools, where bathing suits are not ordinarily worn,\" inspection of swimmers was done by attendants to see that a thorough preliminary shower was taken. Colleges for men, such as those operated by the Jesuits, ended nude swimming when they admitted women in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Public universities, such as the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Iowa State University and the University of Maryland required nudity for male swimmers until the 1970s.\nQuestioning and decline of nudity.\nBy the 1950s, new developments in pool chlorination, filtration, and nylon swimsuits led to the gradual elimination of nudity from recommendations for pool sanitation. The APHA abandoned its recommendation of nude swimming for males in 1962. However, the custom did not immediately cease, the rationale switching from hygiene to the cost savings and maintaining a tradition of male behavior.\nIn 1961, parents and students in Menasha, Wisconsin asked the school board to give boys permission to wear swim trunks. The board voted down a petition signed by 371 parents on the grounds that buying swim trunks would be expensive and that nude swimming built men's character; one board member asserted that \"this experience is a good one for later life, for example the armed services, where the disregard for privacy is real and serious\". Another board member noted that swimmers had no privacy in the gang showers required for the classes. A letter from the Department of Public Education stated that nudity for boys was practiced throughout the state to promote sanitation and to save time. A survey of other schools found suits were worn only at schools where the pool was not completely separate from other areas.\nIn Janesville, Wisconsin nude swimming became an issue at Marshall Junior High in 1967 in part because boys at nearby Franklin Junior High wore suits because their pool had outside windows. The boys at Franklin were issued nylon suits, as were the girls at both schools. One coach noted that boys being from different backgrounds and being at different stages of maturity, some found nudity embarrassing, while others took it for granted. Parents, physicians, and clergy voiced various positions pro and con. The deciding factor was again the cost of purchasing suits for all boys.\nIn 1966 and 1967, the Manitowoc, Wisconsin Recreation Department held evening recreational swimming utilizing school pools, families on Tuesdays, women on Wednesdays. On Thursdays, part of the session was for fathers and sons, while the final hour was for men only. Women were supplied suits if they did not bring their own; for men and boys, suits were \"permitted...those wishing to wear trunks must bring their own\". Children's classes were on Saturday mornings, with separate sessions by age and sex. Only girls were required to bring a suit.\nIn a 1973 Duluth, Minnesota school board meeting, a discussion of \"skinny-dipping\" in the boys junior high school swim classes following complaints from parents who cited modesty according to the supervisor of physical education. A school board member called this false modesty in a gym class where students must shower nude. For the board, the issue was the $12,000 needed to buy suits for 2500 students in the district.\nDuring the 1970s, the adoption of mixed-gender swimming led to the gradual abandonment of nude male swimming in schools. Federal Title IX rules mandating gender equality in physical education led most schools to switch to co-educational classes, ending nude swimming in public schools by the 1980s. In the 21st century, the practice has been forgotten, denied having existed, or viewed as an example of questionable behaviors in the past that are no longer acceptable. However, Jungian psychoanalyst Barry Miller views the sexualization of nudity in male only situations such as locker rooms and swimming pools as a loss."

        "text": "The 2023 Tour de France was the 110th edition of the Tour de France. It started in Bilbao, Spain, on 1 July and ended with the final stage at Champs-Élysées, Paris, on 23 July.\nDefending champion Jonas Vingegaard () won the general classification for the second year in a row. Two-time champion Tadej Pogačar () finished in second place, with Adam Yates (UAE Team Emirates) finishing third.\nThe race began in Bilbao in the Basque Country before returning to France. The first two weeks of the race was closely fought between Vingegaard and Pogačar, with just 10 seconds between the riders by the end of the second week. The decisive stages were the individual time trial on stage 16 where Vingegaard won by 1 minute 38 seconds ahead of Pogačar, and the subsequent stage in the Alps where Vingegaard extended his lead to over seven minutes. Vingegaard won the Tour for the second year running, putting him equal on Tour wins with his rival Pogačar. His winning margin of 7 minutes 29 seconds was the largest since 2014.\nThe points classification was won by Jasper Philipsen () for the first time. The mountains classification was won by Giulio Ciccone (), the first Italian to achieve this feat since 1992. The young rider classification was won by Pogačar for the fourth year in a row, and the team of won the team classification. Victor Campenaerts () was chosen as the most combative rider.\nThe race was followed by the second edition of the Tour de France Femmes, which held its first stage on the final day of the men's Tour.\nTeams.\n22 teams took part in the race. All 18 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited. They were joined by 4 UCI ProTeams: the two highest placed UCI ProTeams in 2022 ( and ), along with and who were selected by Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), the organisers of the Tour. The teams were announced on 4 January 2023.\nUCI WorldTeams\nUCI ProTeams\nRoute and stages.\nIn January 2022, Amaury Sport Organisation announced that the Basque Country in Spain would host the \"Grand Départ\", with the first stage in Bilbao. It was the second time that the Basque Country hosted the Tour's start, following the 1992 edition. In October 2022, the full route was announced by Christian Prudhomme.\nThe race began in Bilbao, next to the Guggenheim Museum, before crossing into France on stage 3. After two stages in the Pyrenees, the Tour returned to the Puy de Dôme for the first time since 1988 at the end of the first week. After the first rest day, the race crossed over the Massif Central into the Alps, with stage 13 on Bastille Day ending with a summit finish on the Col du Grand Colombier. Another summit finish followed two stages later, this time at Saint-Gervais-les-Bains. Following the second rest day, stage 16 was the only individual time trial of the race, at in length. Stage 17 in the Alps featured the most amount of climbing, with over on the way to Courchevel. Two transitional stages led to the penultimate day, ending at Le Markstein in the Vosges, before a transfer for the ceremonial final stage in Paris.\nThe first week of the Tour was described by French rider Romain Bardet () as \"most difficult [...] that ever existed\", featuring a large number of high-mountain climbs and offering up the possibility of significant time differences between the general classification contenders. The route was considered to favour climbers, with one short, uphill time trial on stage 16. \nPre-race favourites.\nThe 2023 Tour de France was generally expected to be a two-way fight between defending champion Jonas Vingegaard () and two-time winner Tadej Pogačar (). Both had finished in first and second place respectively the year before, with the positions reversed in 2021. The pair had raced against one another early in the season at Paris–Nice, a race won by Pogačar, while Vingegaard finished third. Vingegaard's form then picked up as the season progressed. He won three stages and the overall classification at the Tour of the Basque Country in April. At the Critérium du Dauphiné, the most important preparation event for the Tour, he won two stages and won the general classification by the biggest margin since 1993. Pogačar meanwhile enjoyed a very successful spring campaign, winning the Tour of Flanders, the Amstel Gold Race, and La Flèche Wallonne. He also came fourth at Milan–San Remo and third at the E3 Saxo Classic. A crash and subsequent injury at Liège–Bastogne–Liège then interrupted his season.\nBehind Vingegaard and Pogačar, the best chances at overall victory were given to 2022 Giro d'Italia winner Jai Hindley (). His best result in the run-up to the Tour was fourth overall at the Critérium du Dauphiné. Other riders named as possible favourites were Mikel Landa (), Enric Mas (), David Gaudu (), former Giro d'Italia winner Richard Carapaz (), Ben O'Connor (), and Romain Bardet (). Following his victory at the Tour de Suisse, the name of Mattias Skjelmose () was also added to the list of potential favourites. Also named, albeit with even lower chances of victory, were Adam Yates (), his brother Simon Yates (), Daniel Martínez, Tom Pidcock (both ), and Giulio Ciccone (). Egan Bernal (), the winner of the 2019 Tour de France, was not given big chances to win overall, since he was still recovering from a life-threatening crash the year before, even though he performed well at the Critérium du Dauphiné.\nFour-time winner Chris Froome (), who had so far not managed to reach his previous form after a serious accident in 2019, was left off his team's Tour roster. The most notable absentees from the race were a quartet of general classification favourites and former Grand Tour winners who chose to prioritise the 2023 Giro d'Italia, which featured more time trial kilometres than the Tour in 2023, which suited some of these riders. Those four were eventual Giro winner Primož Roglič (), 2018 Tour winner Geraint Thomas () and two who left the Giro through illness and injury when highly placed, 2020 Giro winner Tao Geoghegan Hart () and incumbent World Champion and Vuelta a España winner Remco Evenepoel ().\nSeveral riders were seen as possible favourites for victories on stages ending in bunch sprints and therefore for the points classification, which is won based on points collected by high placings on individual stages and awards a green jersey. Mark Cavendish () returned for his last Tour de France and was chasing the record for most stage wins by any rider, starting the Tour on an equal number of 34 with Eddy Merckx. A stage win at the Giro d'Italia proved that Cavendish was still a strong sprinter, even at the age of 38. Due to strong performances so far in the season, the best chances at multiple sprint stage wins were given to Jasper Philipsen (). Other favourites in this category included Dylan Groenewegen (), and Fabio Jakobsen (). Riders who could excel both in sprints and on more hilly terrain, and therefore would be candidates for the points classification as well, were defending green jersey winner Wout van Aert (), former world champion Mads Pedersen (), Mathieu van der Poel (), and Biniam Girmay ().\nRace overview.\n\"Grand Départ\" and Week One.\nThe first stage around Bilbao in the Basque Country saw a crash of several riders, which ultimately forced two pre-race favourites, Carapaz and Mas, to abandon. The race broke into several groups over the two final climbs of the day, with identical twins Simon and Adam Yates breaking away from a select group on the final ascent. The pair held their advantage to the finish, with Adam Yates taking the stage win and the first leader's yellow jersey ahead of his brother. Pogačar won the sprint in the group behind to finish third, and Neilson Powless () took the lead in the mountains classification. Stage 2 featured the climb of the Jaizkibel, prominently used in the race Clásica de San Sebastián later in the season. On the climb, a select group of favourites emerged ahead of the peloton, with Pogačar taking eight bonus seconds available at the summit ahead of Vingegaard. Victor Lafay () broke clear of the leading group within the final kilometre of the stage and managed to keep his advantage to win the stage ahead of van Aert, while Yates retained the yellow jersey.\nJasper Philipsen won the following two, relatively flat, stages from bunch sprints. On stage 3 into Bayonne, he came in ahead of Phil Bauhaus (), following a strong lead-out by teammate Mathieu van der Poel. Yates remained in the leader's jersey while Powless collected more points for the mountains classification as part of the breakaway. Philipsen then won ahead of Caleb Ewan () and Bauhaus at the finish of stage 4, which ended at the Circuit Paul Armagnac in Nogaro. The final part of the stage was marred by several crashes, including Fabio Jakobsen, while Yates retained the yellow jersey for another day. Following two hard opening days and with the high mountains of the Pyrenees to come the day after, the field was taking a slow tempo during stage 4, with no breakaway forming until into the race. This led to criticism, with some, such as stage winner Philipsen, describing it as \"the most boring Tour de France stage for a long time\".\nOn stage 5, the first mountain stage in the Pyrenees, a 36-man breakaway containing multiple pre-race favourites including Jai Hindley escaped from the bunch and established a stable advantage. The maximum lead of the group over the field was four minutes and was still at 2:30 minutes as it began the ascent of the final climb of the day, the Col de Marie-Blanque. Hindley dropped the remaining breakaway riders and rode alone over the top of the climb and into the finish in Laruns to win the stage, taking the lead in the general classification. Felix Gall () had gained enough points during the stage to go into the lead of the mountains classification. Behind in the group of favourites, Vingegaard attacked from the summit of the Marie-Blanque and managed to distance Pogačar. Catching up to several breakaway riders, Vingegaard finished fifth on the day, 34 seconds behind Hindley. Pogačar opted to wait for distanced teammate Adam Yates to try to limit his losses, but eventually arrived at the finish 1:04 minutes behind Vingegaard, dropping to sixth place overall. With him came in other favourites such as Gaudu, Martinez, Rodriguez, and the Yates brothers. Meanwhile, Ben O'Connor and Romain Bardet lost 1:57 minutes to Hindley.\nOn stage 6, Vingegaard employed similar tactics to stage 5, outdistancing Hindley, but was unable to answer Pogačar's attack from the finish line; Pogačar won the stage and narrowed Vingegaard's general-classification lead over him to 25 seconds, while Vingegaard took the yellow jersey and second place on the stage. The seventh stage, another flat stage ending in a bunch sprint, was won by Philipsen again, narrowly beating Mark Cavendish, whose bicycle gears slipped within metres of the finish line, slowing his momentum. Stage 8 put an end to Cavendish's attempt to break the record for most stage wins, as an injury sustained in a crash forced him to abandon the Tour; the stage was won in a sprint by Mads Pedersen. In stage 9, a 14-man breakaway emerged early; late in the stage, Matteo Jorgenson () broke away from the breakaway and led the race alone for most of the last before being overtaken in the last by Michael Woods (), who won the stage at the top of the Puy de Dôme. Vingegaard retained the yellow jersey, but lost time to Pogačar, who crossed the finish line eight seconds ahead of him.\nWeek Two.\nAfter the first rest day, stage 10 had a chaotic beginning, with many groups of riders—at one point including Vingegaard and Pogačar—attempting to break away before being caught by the peloton; a stable breakaway emerged around the halfway point of the stage. Krists Neilands attacked the breakaway group and was solo leader for much of the last section of the stage, but was eventually caught by other breakaway riders including Pello Bilbao, who went on to win the stage. Bilbao dedicated his victory to his late teammate Gino Mäder, who had died after a crash in the Tour de Suisse the previous month. Jasper Philipsen took his fourth stage-win of the Tour in a sprint on the eleventh stage to Moulins. In the twelfth stage, Ion Izagirre of the Cofidis team came in first after he escaped solo in the last towards Belleville en Beaujolais. Michał Kwiatkowski won stage 13 after breaking away on his own from the finish at the top of the Grand Colombier. Pogačar cut Vingegaard's lead to nine seconds.\nIn the fourteenth stage, an early 13-rider crash led race officials to suspend the stage for 30 minutes and caused several riders to abandon the Tour. On the climb to the Col de Joux Plane, Pogačar and Vingegaard led the stage. Pogačar attacked about from the top of the climb, but Vingegaard recovered and caught up with him; Pogačar's next attack was obstructed by media motorcycles crowding the road. Carlos Rodríguez caught Vingegaard and Pogačar during the final descent and went on to win the stage, moving one second ahead of Jai Hindley into third place overall. Wout Poels soloed to victory in stage 15 after he broke away from the finish line on the penultimate climb of the Côtes des Amerands. It was his first Tour de France stage win after years as a super-domestique.\nWeek Three.\nThe third week began with a time trial of 22.4 km between Passy and Combloux in which Pogačar aimed to reverse the 10 second lead of Vingegaard, but the latter won stage 16 decisively and widened his lead to 1 minute and 48 seconds. Pogačar came in second, over a minute ahead of Vingegaard's teammate van Aert, while Adam Yates moved into third place in the general classification, ahead of Rodriguez. On stage 17, which was a mountainous one, a fierce counter-attack from Pogačar was expected. However, Pogačar needed assistance from his teammate Marc Soler in the climb towards the Col de la Loze and lost further time to Vingegaard, who widened the lead to more than seven minutes in a stage won by Gall.\nKasper Asgreen held off the competition to win the eighteenth stage, which entered the Rhone valley. Meanwhile, van Aert left the race to be with his wife, who was about to give birth. On stage 19, Matej Mohorič won by the width of a rim to beat Asgreen in a photo finish in Poligny. After winning the stage, Mohorič, during an emotional interview on the difficulty of professional cycling, paid tribute to his late teammate Gino Mäder, who died in a crash at in the Tour de Suisse in June. In the twentieth stage, Thibaut Pinot, in his last Tour before retirement, attacked the breakaway and was solo leader at the top of the Petit Ballon, which was lined by thousands of fans cheering him on. He was overtaken and dropped by the race leaders on the ascent to the Col du Platzerwasel, and Pogačar won the stage ahead of Gall and his tour rival Vingegaard. In the same stage, the Italian Giulio Ciccone sealed the victory for the mountain classification. He is the first Italian to achieve this feat since Claudio Chiappucci in 1992.\nThe final stage was traditionally calm and the Belgian Jordi Meeus won just ahead of his compatriot Philipsen, Groenewegen, and Pedersen. Philipsen won the green jersey of the points classification for the first time in his career. Vingegaard crossed the finish line at the Champs-Élysées arm in arm with his teammates, finishing 7:29 minutes ahead of Pogačar and 10:56 minutes ahead of Adam Yates to win the Tour de France for the second straight year. His winning margin of 7 minutes 29 seconds was the largest since 2014. Vingegaard's Team Jumbo–Visma won the teams classification. Victor Campenaerts was chosen as the most combative rider. Runner up Pogačar won the white jersey of the young rider classification for the fourth year in a row."

        "text": "The Ostioneros de Guaymas (English: \"Guaymas Oyster Farmers\") are a Mexican professional basketball team based in Guaymas, Sonora. The Ostioneros are members of the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pacífico (CIBACOPA) and play their games at the Gimnasio Municipal de Guaymas.\nThey are named after the Ostioneros de Guaymas, a defunct baseball team which was a charter member of the Mexican Pacific League.\nHistory.\nThe Ostioneros de Guaymas were established in 2008. They joined the Circuito de Baloncesto de la Costa del Pacífico (CIBACOPA), becoming the third team from Guaymas to play in the league after the Marineros and the Bucaneros. The Ostioneros de Guaymas played their debut season in 2009 and finished third in the North Zone with a 20–20 record. The team was eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Rayos de Hermosillo. Two Ostioneros players, Larry Satchell and Jorge Rochín, were named to the All-Star Game. The Ostioneros were again eliminated in the quarterfinals in 2010, losing to the Mineros de Cananea four games to three.\nIn 2011, the Ostioneros finished 21–17 for the fifth-best record in the league. They won their first playoff series in team history by defeating the Frayles de Guasave in seven games. Ostioneros forward Jerome Habel led the team with 19 points and 11 rebounds in their 94–61 blowout victory in game 7. In 2012, Guaymas improved to 27–11 and finished second to the Rayos de Hermosillo in wins. The Ostioneros defeated the Fuerza Guinda de Nogales in five games in the quarterfinals before beating the Tijuana Zonkeys in a seven-game semi-final series to qualify for their its first CIBACOPA finals. However, they were defeated by the Rayos de Hermosillo in a hard-fought seven-game series where two games went to overtime. The Ostioneros finished second in the standings once again in 2013 with a 23–9 record. However, they were swept 4–0 in the opening round of the playoffs by the Mineros de Cananea. Guaymas only won 11 of their 32 games the following year and were eliminated in the quarterfinals by the Tijuana Zonkeys.\nGuaymas hired Andrés \"Veneno\" Contreras as their head coach ahead of the 2015 season. They also signed Orien Greene. The Ostioneros finished the year with a league-best 28–10 record and second in the general table, behind only the Náuticos de Mazatlán. Guaymas beat the Caballeros de Culiacán, 4–1, in the quarterfinals. However, they were defeated by the Fuerza Guinda de Nogales in the semi-finals, losing the decisive game 7 by a score of 85–74. Ahead of the 2016 season, the Ostioneros signed Devin Green. They defeated the Vaqueros de Agua Prieta in first round of the playoffs before losing to the Náuticos de Mazatlán, 4–1, in the semi-finals. Guaymas then went 19–19 the following year for a sixth-place finish. They beat the Tijuana Zonkeys in the quarterfinals but were once again eliminated in the semi-finals, losing in five games to the Rayos de Hermosillo. By this time, a rivalry had developed between Guaymas and Hermosillo.\nGuaymas hired Venezuelan coach Jesús Cordoes to take the reins ahead of the 2018 season. The team failed to reach the playoffs, losing the eight seed to the Halcones de Ciudad Obregón on a tiebreaker. Guaymas announced a new head coach, Mike Corona, ahead of the 2019 season. The team returned to the playoffs, but were eliminated by the Rayos de Hermosillo in the first round. Guaymas played only two games, going 1–1, before the season was interrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2021 season was subsequently cancelled as well.\nIn February 2022, Guaymas hired longtime NBA assistant John Welch as their new head coach ahead of their return to play. The Ostioneros went 19–15 that season, finishing second in the general table. However, they were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs by the Venados de Mazatlán, who came back from a 3–0 series deficit to beat Guaymas 93–85 in game 7. For the 2023 season, the Ostioneros hired Spanish coach to take the reins. They opened the season with a 141–140 victory over the Rayos de Hermosillo in six overtimes, setting a new record for the longest game in league history. The team finished seventh in the general table after compiling a 12–22 record. They were eliminated in the quarterfinals once again, losing in six games to the Astros de Jalisco.\nHome arena.\nThe Ostioneros play their home games at the Gimnasio Municipal de Guaymas (English: Guaymas Municipal Gymnasium), which has a capacity of 1,200 spectators. The venue is also known as \"el Tsunami\"."

        "text": "Exeter Golf and Country Club is a golf club in Exeter, England. \nDesigned by golfer James Braid in 1895, it is an 18-hole parkland course stretching 6023 yards and with sixty bunkers, including a grass driving range, large putting green and short game practice area. Today, it has over 4,500 members.\nHistory.\nExeter Golf and Country Club was founded in April 1895 on the outskirts of Exeter city in Pennsylvania, with the first annual meeting held on 4 October. During their first meeting, it was announced that 40 people had been elected as members of the club, in addition to its founding members, comprising several local men who had an interest in the sport. Several ladies also expressed an interest to apply for admission, although none had been admitted by the time of the meeting and it was deemed necessary to prepare a women's only course before considering their admission. The club obtained ground known as Stoke Wood Farm with favourable letting arrangements. On their first anniversary in April 1896, a club house was formally opened and on the same day, the club's first match was played with Seaton, which Exeter won by 17 points.\nDuring its third annual meeting held in October 1897, membership numbers were reported to be 96, while just one match had been played during the year, which the club won. The accounts showed a balance of over £110. The committee authorised expenditure of £40 to finance a mowing machine and a horse.\nIn 1919, Captain George Henry James Duckworth-King sold the estate; in 1927, the Wear Park estate, which was once owned by Henry III, was purchased to accommodate a new course. In October 1928, the club formally transferred from Pennsylvania to their new course at Countess Wear, around a year after the Wear House grounds were acquired by the club. The accompanying mansion was converted into a club house and the grounds adapted to provide an 18-hole course, as well as tennis recreations. The membership numbers deemed it necessary to move to a new ground, while it was expected the transfer would likely increase membership interest over the following months.\nBy 1941, membership had reached 457 people, of which 312 were men, while in excess of 1,000 games had been played.\nIts longest-serving director to date is businessman Alan Eveleigh, who ran the club from 4 November 1992 to 29 October 2005.\nFeatures.\nThe modern golf course includes Wear Park Restaurant and Wear Park Spa."

        "text": "The 2022–23 St. Francis Brooklyn Terriers men's basketball team represented St. Francis College in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The Terriers, led by 13th-year head coach Glenn Braica, opened the season as members of the Northeast Conference, playing their final two home games at Daniel Lynch Gymnasium in Brooklyn Heights, New York. On November 30, 2022, the Terriers temporarily began playing their home games at the Pratt Activity Resource Center, frequently called the Pratt ARC, on the main Brooklyn campus of Pratt Institute, due to St. Francis College's move to its new campus on Livingston Street.\nThe Terriers finished the season 14–16, 7–9 in NEC play to finish in a tie for seventh place. As the No. 7 seed in the NEC Tournament, they lost to Fairleigh Dickinson in the quarterfinals. On March 20, St. Francis Brooklyn announced the discontinuation of their athletic department, meaning the 2022–23 season would be the final season in school history.\nPrevious season.\nThe Terriers finished the 2021–22 season 10–20, 7–11 in NEC play to finish in sixth place. As the 5 seed, they were defeated by 4 seed Mount St. Mary's in the quarterfinals of the NEC Tournament.\nFinal game.\nIn what would prove to be the final men's basketball game in the history of St. Francis Brooklyn, Fairleigh Dickinson scored the first seven points and led wire to wire to complete a season sweep of three games over the Terriers with an 83–75 victory in the NEC Tournament quarterfinals. The Knights' biggest lead was 16, at 30–14, in the first half, and they led, 45–30, at halftime. The Terriers cut the deficit to four points with 1:48 to play, after an 11–4 run, led by redshirt freshman Zion Bethea, but Fairleigh Dickinson hit their free throws down the stretch. Bethea and Tedrick Wilcox Jr. finished with 17 points each for St. Francis Brooklyn. Wilcox added six assists and three steals.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=| Regular season\n!colspan=9 style=| NEC Tournament\nSources"

        "title": "1944 Auckland Rugby League season",
        "text": "The 1944 Auckland Rugby League season was its 36th. The Auckland Rugby League allowed the Point Chevalier club to enter the first grade competition which meant that it was an even ten teams. There was no reserve grade competition as the war affected adult playing numbers once more. Several former senior players were killed along with others who had played or been involved in Auckland rugby league.\nThe City Rovers won the Fox Memorial first grade championship for the 8th time in their history, however it was their first championship for 19 years after last winning it in 1925. Their titles prior to 1944 were in 1910, 1911, 1916, 1921, 1922, 1923, and 1925. City also won the Rukutai Shield for being in the lead at the conclusion of the first round of the championship. It looked as though their season might be derailed at the halfway point when they protested the suspension of Eugene Donovan who was sent off in a match against Richmond for back chatting experienced referee G. Kelly. City refused to play their round 12 and round 13 matches and lost by default as a result. The league then informed them that they were disqualified from the championship and would be awarded no further competition points regardless of their results according to rules laid out in their constitution regarding successive unfulfilled fixtures. They had a change of mind however and allowed them to compete for the championship. City won their last 5 matches to force a playoff for the championship with Mount Albert United who were level with them on 26 competition points. City won the match 17 to 7 to claim the title.\nPonsonby United won the Roope Rooster knockout trophy for the 6th time when they beat North Shore Albions in the final 19-13 on October 14. Both teams had had disappointing Fox Memorial seasons but Ponsonby had steadily improved in the second half of the competition, particularly after their coach, Arthur Kay came out of retirement to take the playing field.\nCity won their third trophy of the season when they defeated Ponsonby 15-11 in the Stormont Shield champion of champions match on October 21 to conclude the season. The Phelan Shield was not competed for owing to the length of the season.\nOnce again the representative season was relatively short, in part due to the length of the club season, but also because there were restrictions on war time travel, especially by rail. Teams needed to be given government permits to travel and the West Coast was unable to obtain one of these for an intended visit to Carlaw Park, and Wellington had the same issue. Auckland beat South Auckland (Waikato) 36 to 5 at Carlaw Park, however a weakened Auckland side with 4 clubs playing in Roope Rooster matches in the same day lost the return match in Huntly 12-10. Auckland Māori defeated Auckland Pākehā 18 to 13 in what had become an annual fixture at Carlaw Park on September 9. The North Island – South Island fixture was played for the first time since 1939 season before a crowd of 16,000 with the North Island winning 43 to 15 with 10 of the 13 North Island players from Auckland.\n \n \n \nAnnual General Meeting.\nPrior to the annual meeting the 34th annual report was released. It stated that \"from a financial point of view the league is making steady progress. The total assets are £10,785, from which must be deducted liabilities amounting to £1,519. Assets show and increase of £42, and liabilities a decrease of £416. The surplus for the season was £223\". There had been an increase of £4320 in revenue due to better attendance at matches at Carlaw Park, and also through hiring the park out during the off-season to sports such as baseball. They had collected gate receipts of £3,972 from club games and the three representative matches \"which compared very favourably with the best seasons\". \nThe annual meeting was held on Tuesday, March 28 in the League Rooms on Courthouse Lane at 7:30 pm. At the meeting chairman Mr. J.W. Watson said \"we are providing football for 1300 players every Saturday\". He went on to say that the schoolboys' organisation had a very successful season with 30 teams in the competition. The organisation had \"done splendid work for the boys. They had decided to set up a board of control to govern schoolboy football, which would be similar to the junior board of control\". He went on to say that \"there were 10 junior teams, with about 600 players. He urged the senior clubs to take a greater interest in the juniors. In the senior grade they had nine teams, with about 150 players. The large number of players in the game showed... how wide flung the activities of the Rugby League were\". He also paid tribute to the work of the referees and believed that \"after the war there would be a great swing to sport of all kinds. At present there were just enough playing grounds, and he considered the local bodies should provide more grounds for the future\". Mr. Dickson made reference to the illness of the president and former chairman Mr. G. Grey Campbell, \"and a unanimous vote of sympathy was passed, with wishes for a speedy recovery\". \nThe following officers were elected: Patron, Mr. J.B. Donald; vice patron, Mr. J.F.W.

Doble; club delegates to board of control Messrs Jim Clark, T. Davis, W.J. Probert and D. Wilkie; honorary secretary Mr. Ivan Culpan; honorary treasurer Mr. R. Doble. In October Mr. T. Davis resigned from his position on the board of control. Mr. F.T. McAneny was appointed in his position for the remainder of the season.\nSenior competition.\nTen teams were nominated for the senior Fox Memorial championship: Manukau, Richmond, Ponsonby, Newton, Marist, City, North Shore, Otahuhu, Mt Albert, and Point Chevalier. All of these teams had taken part in the previous season with the exception of Point Chevalier who had applied to join. The Auckland Rugby League at their board of control meeting on March 28 decided to ask the club to send two officials to the next board meeting to give information as to the playing strength of the team. The application of Point Chevalier was accepted to participate in the preliminary round which would begin on April 15. They were to play the curtain raiser to the principal match on the main field at Carlaw Park against Otahuhu. As there would now be 5 senior matches per round one would need to be played away from Carlaw Park each week and in the first round of preliminary games the Richmond match with Marist was scheduled for Grey Lynn Park. \nAt the May 10 meeting of the board of control it was recommended by the Senior Club Officers Association that during the 1944 season senior clubs should be allowed to play first juniors (second grade players) as seniors and vice versa without the requirement for them to be regraded. The recommendation was accepted. At the May 24 meeting it was suggested by the Referees Association that teams in the early games at Carlaw Park remain on the field at halftime and not retire to the dressing rooms. The reason was that the games were late to kick off in the second half. The request was declined with Mr. R. Doble stating that this procedure had been attempted years ago and was not a success then. It was decided to enforce the rule about getting players out in time.\nWith there being ten teams and five matches in each round it meant that one match would have to be played away from Carlaw Park each weekend. The grounds used were Devonport Domain (5), Grey Lynn Park (4), Walker Park in Point Chevalier (4), Fowlds Park in Morningside (3), Sturges Park in Otahuhu (1), Ellerslie Domain (1), and Onehunga School (1).\nAt the June 21 meeting of the board it was suggested that the second round of the competition be split into two as some teams were well out of contention already, Pt Chevalier had 1 win and 7 losses while Newton had lost all 8 of their matches. Mr. R. Doble said \"that a keen second round was assured, but there were some teams hopelessly out of the competition\". Mr. J. Clark suggested that the senior officers' association should be consulted before any change was made and it was decided to defer any decision until after the final matches in the first round were played. \nHorace Hunt, the North Shore captain was awarded a gold medal donated by Mr. J.F.W. Dickson for the most sportsmanlike players. Hunt had been connected to the North Shore club since 1926 when he was in his teens. He captained the North Shore reserve grade side when they won the inaugural reserve grade championship in 1931. He began playing in their senior side in 1932 when they won the championship. He had retired in 1939 and played a season of soccer before returning to the North Shore league side which had been depleted by the war effort. When Verdun Scott left for the war in 1941 Hunt took over the captaincy and North Shore won the championship for the 6th time. He also played cricket for the R.V. club in the city and Suburban senior competition and had represented Auckland in the Plunket Shield as wicket keeper four times in 1930 and 1931. \nAt the board of control meeting on October 11 a letter \"was received from the Point Chevalier club in reference to an increase in the transfer club fee from £2 to £10. It was decided that the time was not opportune to amend the existing regulations\".\nProtest defaults of City Rovers.\nIn their round 12 win over Richmond the City side had Eugene Donovan ordered off the field for insulting the referee. Eugene was the brother of fellow City player Alan Donovan and senior referee Jack Donovan. They had a fourth brother who was killed in the war. The Auckland Rugby League decided to force Donovan to apologise to the referee to avoid suspension and after he failed to do this he was unable to play. The City club decided to default their match against Manukau despite efforts still being made at 2 pm on match day to solve the issue. They were due to play the feature game on the number 1 field at 3:10 pm. The City club supplied the Auckland Star with the following statement \"in the game between Richmond and City, played at Carlaw Park on Saturday, July 8, Eugene Donovan, of city, was ordered off for alleged back-answering to the referee, Mr. G. Kelly, ten minutes after the commencement of the game. The City five-eight, Salaia, had just scored a try, and E. Donovan was retiring back to the halfway line, along with A. Leatherbarrow, when he passed a remark to his team mate. ‘If city's tries are not clear cut this chap won't allow them'. \"The referee overheard the remark, and said ‘any more of that and you will go off'. Donovan replied that he was talking to his team mate, and the referee said that he did not care who he was talking to. \"E. Donovan then replied that he would talk to his team mate anytime he wanted to. The referee then ordered him off. \"These remarks can be corroborated by other City players. After the match the referee and Donovan were ordered to appear before the judicial committee or the control board, when conflicting evidence of the two men concerned was given, at the conclusion of which Donovan was ordered to apologise. This he refused to do as he claimed that he had told the truth and to apologise would be a confession of guilt. He then left the room. \"Questioned by the City club officials, E. Donovan declared that he had told the truth and that he would rather hang up his boots than apologise for an offence he had not committed. A special meeting of the senior team and club officials was called before the game (Manukau and City last Saturday). It was unanimously resolved that the club endorse the attitude of E. Donovan\". It was also noted later that referee G. Kelly had not asked for an apology. City then defaulted for a second consecutive Saturday when they refused to play their match against Marist on July 22 at Carlaw Park. Following round 13 the suspension of Donovan was lifted however as the City club had defaulted on two successive Saturdays, under the league constitution were disqualified from the championship. The controversy rolled on however as the city club found out after Watson's statement after their meeting to the press that they would receive no competition points for any of their remaining matches. And they also disagreed with the implication that Donovan had apologised to the referee. \"This is contrary to fact and cannot be substantiated\". It was then announced on August 12 that City would in fact be allowed to accrue competition points over the remainder of the season. \nFostering of junior grades.\nIn October at the board of control meeting various speakers strongly urged the need to stimulate junior football in Auckland. Chairman Watson said \"clubs which do not make an effort to foster junior football are doomed to extinction\". He went on to add that \"the real work of the league clubs was to foster juniors, and pointed to clubs like Richmond. Otahuhu, and Mount Albert, now strong numerically and financially. The Point Chevalier Club was coming to the front through its encouragement of junior football\". The chairman of the Schoolboys' Control Board, Mr. Maurice Wetherill said that \"the board had functioned well, and its members were keen to help school league football. It was felt that they did not get the publicity that they should. They were up against stronger opposition than any other branch of the league code. An effort to interest headmasters of schools had, up to a point, been successful. At the Mount Albert school the code had received splendid support, and there they had had use of what was regarded as the best all-weather ground in Auckland\". Mr. H. Howe, the deputy-chairman of the Junior Control Board, said \"they had had the best season for years, and in the third and fourth grades there had been brilliant football. If the senior teams gave more attention to the juniors there would be no necessity to look for players from the rugby union. Ivan Sumich was an example of a young player who had risen from the league juniors\". Mr. L. Rout, secretary of the Schoolboys' control Board said there was a wonderful opportunity for league football in New Zealand… in Auckland they had gone a log way with schoolboy football, but they would have to go further. He hoped to see the code taken up by all the schools, and would like to see it carried into the secondary schools. The success of Sumich had been mentioned, but there were dozens of others, and one could point to Ron McGregor, of the Richmond club. Fifty percent of the senior players came from the schoolboy ranks. \nCarlaw Park.\nDuring the annual meeting in March, chairman Watson said that \"during the off-season the management committee and trustees had decided to make improvement to Carlaw Park and, once building restrictions were eased, it was proposed to cover, in portions, the terraces on the main ground. The erection of specially-designed gates at the entrance to the park in the form of a war memorial was also intended\". \n At the June 7 board meeting it was decided to provide a permanent place in the grandstand for any disabled soldiers. At the July 5 meeting chairman Watson said that \"despite bad weather there has been a considerable increase in the gate takings at Carlaw Park this season\", and added that it had been the biggest revenue for the past four seasons. \nAvailability of grounds.\nAt the board of control meeting on May 17 the issue of ground availability was raised. Chairman Watson said \"that for years the increasing shortage of playing grounds in the different suburbs had been pointed out, and the difficulty was being faced by all codes\". He went on to refer to \"the number of playing grounds lost through being taken over by the Armed Forces\". \nAll Golds Old Boys Association Sunday matches.\nDuring the season the All Golds Old Boys Association organised matches on Sundays at Walker Park in Point Chevalier. They had initially established themselves as the New Zealand Rugby League Old Boys Association before changing their name due to not having any official affiliation with New Zealand Rugby League. The matches attracted very large crowds ranging from 2 to 4,000 and featured players who had played on Saturday or rugby players which caused considerable concern for Auckland Rugby which sought to ban any of their registered players for taking part. Auckland Council had given permission for the matches and provided extra tramcars to meet the demand. On the morning of July 14 Auckland Rugby League chairman Watson released a statement saying \"the organisation carrying on Sunday football at Walker Park is not connected with the Auckland Rugby League\". And continued \"it should be understood that the league is not in favour of organised Sunday football and considers that the competition at present being played on Sundays is not in the best interests of the game. We feel that there is room in Auckland for only one competition, and that should be the one conducted by the official body\". The Auckland Council then prohibited the playing of football at Walker Park, Point Chevalier on Sundays after passing a resolution on July 14. Protests had been received from two churches (Point Chevalier Presbyterian Church and Point Chevalier Baptist Church) and five residents in the vicinity of the park. The Auckland Transport Board had also asked the council for their attitude on the games. Their regular services had become so overcrowded taking spectators to the matches that ordinary passengers were unable to ride. The council decided to inform the New Zealand All Golds Old Boys Association Social Club that \"the holding of organised football on Walker Park on Sundays constituted an entertainment for which the consent of the council was required under section 313 of the Municipal Corporations Act. \nRepresentative team.\nAt the May 17 board of control meeting the appointments were made for the three Auckland selectors for the representative season. They were Robert Doble, Jim Clark, and Jack Kirwan. It was originally intended to play a match against South Auckland (Waikato) in early June however advice was received from Huntly that the government had asked the miners to work on Monday, June 5 which was King's Birthday, and it \"was considered the match should be postponed until a later date\". Auckland received requests for matches at Carlaw Park by South Auckland, West Coast, and Wellington. However Auckland had difficulty in scheduling the matches due to war time travel restrictions with permission needing to be obtained from the government. In late June the league received advice that railway travel permits were not going to be granted for the West Coast team. The West Coast union decided to apply for permission again at a later date. \nJim Clark was appointed the manager of the side prior to their first match with South Auckland.\nObituaries.\nDonald McFarlane McKenzie.\nOn 24 February it was reported that Sergeant Donald McFarlane McKenzie \"has now been reported lost at sea\". McKenzie had been on an enemy ship (Nino Bixio) in the Mediterranean when it was torpedoed on August 17, 1942, while it was transporting prisoners to Italy from North Africa. He had entered the army in October 1940 and departed New Zealand in September 1941 as part of an early reinforcement draft, seeing service in the desert campaigns. McKenzie has been educated at Te Puke High School before later moving to Auckland where he played for the Newton Rangers first grade side. From 1938 to 1940 McKenzie scored 9 tries and kicked 2 conversions and 2 drop goals in first grade matches. He was aged 26 at the time of his death and survived by his wife Elsie Edith McKenzie, and his parents James and Mary McKenzie. McKenzie is memorialised at the Alamein Memorial in the El Alamein War Cemetery in Egypt, on the Roll of Honour at Greyfriars Presbyterian Church on Mt Eden Road, Auckland, and at the Auckland War Memorial Museum, WW2 Hall of Memories.\nRauaroa Tangaroapeau (Bill) Turei.\nRauaroa Tangaroapeau Turei, better known as Bill Turei was a winger and full back who played for City Rovers from 1932 to 1935. He died of natural causes on April 15, 1944, while in Italy. He was a staff sergeant in the 2nd Māori Battalion and had enlisted in 1941 and went overseas with a reinforcement draft in May, 1943. Turei was educated at Auckland Boys Grammar and Te Aute College. In 1933 he represented Auckland in 4 matches, scoring 5 tries and kicking a conversion. In his debut match against Taranaki on June 10, 1933, he scored 3 tries in a 32–20 win at Carlaw Park. He played against South Auckland on July 15, before scoring 2 tries and kicking a conversion in a match with Taranaki at Western Park in New Plymouth. His final match was against North Auckland on August 12 where he played in the centres alongside Bert Cooke. For City he scored 24 tries, and kicked 12 goals for 96 points. He was the equal leading try scorer in the 1933 season and second in 1934. He was 37 at the time of his death and buried at the Salerno War Cemetery in Italy. At the time of his enlistment he had been living in Ponsonby in Auckland. Turei was survived by his wife, Maud Kathleen Turei.\nWilliam Edward Leo (Billy) Dervan.\nOn April 18 William Edward Leo (Billy) Dervan died at the age of 60 at his residence at 4 St. Stephen's Avenue, Parnell. He was Kiwi #72, representing New Zealand on their 1912 tour of Australia. Dervan was educated at the Marist Brothers' School in Pitt Street. He originally played rugby for Marist Brothers' Old Boys Club, then the City club before switching to rugby league in 1912 where he played in the forwards. He played 4 matches for Newton Rangers in the same season, scoring 5 tries and kicking 4 goals. He retired at the end of the season but served on the Newton committee in 1913. He was heavily involved in boxing and was the official announcer for the Auckland Boxing Association for over 20 years, and took an interest in several other sports such as swimming, wrestling, and cricket. Dervan also volunteered at the New Zealand Institute for the Blind where he \"read to the inmates [and] kept them fully acquainted with topics of the day\".\n(George) G. Grey Campbell.\nOn April 23 Mr. (George) G. Grey Campbell passed away at Green Lane Hospital after a three month battle with illness aged 57. Campbell had been chairman of Auckland Rugby League from 1933 to 1942 and was president for the past two. He was born in Ponsonby on October 7, 1886, and was educated at Ponsonby and Parnell schools. After the First World War he entered a partnership with Mr. J. Victor Macky and established the accounting firm Macky and Campbell. Campbell became a member of the New Zealand Society of Accountants and was a past-president of the Public Accountant's Association. Campbell held several other prominent positions during his working life, and in 1929 was elected to the Auckland City Council, topping the poll for the 1931 elections. Some of the positions he held included being a board member of the Auckland Transport Board, the Auckland Urban Land Sales Committee, and the Auckland University College Council where he represented the government for 8 years. Campbell was responsible after the outbreak of the war for organising many concert parties to military camps around Auckland through the Auckland Community Singing Committee. He also served on the Massey Agricultural College Council. At the time of his death he was also the vice-president of the Ponsonby Bowling Club. He was living at 38 Croydon Road, Mount Eden and was survived by his wife Elsie Ada and two daughters, Gwenyth and Elizabeth. His funeral was at the Beresford Street Congregational Church, where he was the superintendent of the Sunday school for many years, on April 25 at 2 pm. He was buried at Hillsborough Cemetery, Auckland.\nTrevor Clifford Hosken.\nTrevor Clifford Hosken of Wiri, Manurewa was killed in action on April 22, 1944, in Iceland, Atlantic Ocean aged 23. His rank was Warrant Officer, in the Royal New Zealand Air Force, 1407 Meteorological Flight, RAF. He trained at the RCAF, 2 Wireless School in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and the RCAF, 3 Bombing and Gunnery School, MadDonald, Manitoba. He was educated at the Point Chevalier and Manurewa schools. Hosken played for the Papakura seniors from 1939 to 1941 scoring 8 tries and kicking a conversion. He had debuted at the young age of 18. He joined the R.N.Z.A.F in January 1941 and left for Canada in September of the same year. Hosken was survived by his parents as their only son, Joseph Thomas Hosken, and Gladys Florence Louise Hosken (nee Wilson) of Auckland. Hosken was buried at Reykjavik (Fossvogur) Cemetery, Iceland. He is memorialised at the Auckland War Memorial Museum, WW2 Hall of Memories. \nThomas Edwin Avery.\nThomas Edwin Avery died on June 13 aged 60. Avery was born on July 11, 1883. He had played for the City Rovers club from 1910 to 1915 scoring 2 tries. He also made 4 appearances for Auckland from 1910 to 1913. His debut appearance was against Whanganui on September 22 in a 15–14 win at Cooks Garden, while he also played in Auckland's 24-13 win over Nelson at Trafalgar Park in Nelson. He played again against the Combined Goldfields and Thames side in Thames on May 18, 1912, before his final representative match was in an exhibition match for Auckland against the North Shore side on August 16, 1913, at Pukekohe. After retirement he spent time on the City Rovers committee and later became a referee. In 1919 the Maritime Club which he had joined post war as a player nominated him to receive the New Zealand Rugby League's medallion of life membership which was approved. The Auckland Rugby League paid their respects to him at their board meeting on June 14 and sent a letter of condolence to his family. \nFox Memorial Shield (senior grade championship).\nPreliminary rounds.\nRound 1.\nNewton Rangers were being coached by Puti Tipene Watene. Moana Herewini was the coach of the Point Chevalier side. There was some controversy as W.L. Werohia played for Manukau despite having signed on from the South Auckland league with the Newton club. He appeared before the board of control midweek stating that he had thought that his uncle Pita Ririnui would be playing with Newton and later found out that he would play with Manukau, and he wished to now play there instead. He was later given permission to play for Manukau. There was no individual scoring reported from the match at Grey Lynn Park between Richmond and Marist.\nRound 2.\nBefore the matches at Carlaw Park the teams stood in silence to remember former Kiwi and Newton Rangers player Billy Dervan who had passed away.\nFox Memorial results.\nRound 1.\nPrior to the commencement of the main matches all 4 teams lined up and stood in silence for one minute after Mr. J.W. Watson \"referred feelingly to the recent death of Mr. George Grey Campbell\", the former chairman and president of Auckland Rugby League who had passed away recently. Point Chevalier played in their first ever match in the first grade competition and were easily defeated by Richmond 45-14. Their first try scorer was Croad while Dormer kicked their first points. The games were played in heavy rain which made the grounds also heavy, while Grey Lynn was muddy for the match between Marist and Newton. Don McLeod was carried off the field near the end of the match with a knee injury. Hooker, Owen Hughes played for Otahuhu as player/coach after transferring from City.\nRound 2.\nNorth Shore were playing their 400th first grade match when they took on Ponsonby at the Devonport Domain though it is unlikely they were aware of this fact. They became the fourth club to achieve this feat behind fellow foundation clubs City Rovers, Ponsonby, and Newton. After they lost to Ponsonby 8-0 their all time record to this point was played 400, won 206, drawn 26, lost 168. James Matthews returned from the Middle East where he had been serving in the armed forces and played for City having previously played for Marist from 1938-40. He scored a \"spectacular try\" in their win over Richmond. Bert Leatherbarrow was also now playing for City. Travers Hardwick scored his first ever try for Ponsonby. Future All Black, Johnny Simpson scored a hat trick of tries in Marist's win over Point Chevalier. His brother, Ivan had scored for Marist the previous week.\nRound 3.\nOswald Lawrence Martin broke his leg while playing for Manukau against City at Carlaw Park in the main match. He was taken to Auckland Hospital as was Allan Thomas Vost who was concussed in the match at Walker Park between North Shore and Point Chevalier. Vost was playing for the North Shore side.\nRound 4.\nThe match between Mount Albert and Point Chevalier was played on Mount Alberts home ground of Fowlds Park in Morningside. When they scored their last points of the match they passed the 2000 point mark in the first grade competition. They became the 8th club to achieve the feat.\nRound 5.\nJames Chalmers, the former Marist senior player was in attendance at Carlaw Park. He had fought in the war and had a leg amputated as a result of injuries he received. He \"was given a fine welcome by the patrons\". Don Mullett, the New Zealand Heavyweight boxing champion made his first appearance for the Ponsonby side and caused quite a bit of interest.\nRound 6.\nThe round 6 matches were played in rain on heavy fields.\nRound 8.\nPoint Chevalier recorded their first ever win in the Fox Memorial first grade competition when they defeated Newton 9-7 on Carlaw Park #2 field in the early kickoff. Owen Elliott of Newton had to leave the field in the first half with an ankle injury. Richmond played in their 300th first grade match against Otahuhu though it is unlikely they were aware of this fact. Following their win they had an all time record of 300 played, 143 wins, 10 draws, and 147 losses. The match between Marist and North Shore was played at the Ellerslie Domain. The Ellerslie League Football Club was given permission by the Ellerslie Domain Board to \"demand a fee for admission to the domain, not in any case to exceed 6d per person\". In a refereeing milestone, G Kelly refereed in approximately his 100th match involving first grade sides becoming the 4th referee to achieve this feat after Les Bull, Percy Rogers, and Stuart Billman.\nRound 9.\nStuart Billman refereed his 135th match involving first grade sides in Auckland club football which was more than any other referee had done when he officiated in the Otahuhu v City match. He had been a referee for 19 years and in the senior grade for 10. At the end of the season the Auckland Star wrote an article on Billman after he had been elected honorary secretary of the Auckland Centre of the New Zealand Amateur Athletic Association. Otahuhu caused a shock when they defeated the leaders City 15-10 in the main match on the number 1 field. Aubrey Thompson had transferred from Manukau to Richmond and scored a try in their loss to Mount Albert.\nRound 10.\nFlags were flown at half mast after the death in a mining accident in Huntly of New Zealand international George Beadle.\nRound 11.\nFormer New Zealand international Arthur Kay came out of retirement to re-join his Ponsonby side. He kicked a conversion in their 11-4 win over North Shore. N. Finlayson was ordered off for Manukau in their match with Otahuhu but they still won 5–4. Eugene Donovan was ordered off for City in their 13-12 loss to Richmond. The send off happened early in the match due to remarks he made to the referee, G. Kelly. There were rumours in the following Saturday's newspapers that they may not take the field in protest at the send off and they ultimately turned out to be true.\nRound 12.\nCity refused to play their match with Manukau in protest at the punishment imposed on Eugene Donovan who had been sent off the week prior. The Auckland Rugby League had said that unless he apologised to the referee (G. Kelly) he would remain suspended. As he had not apologised he was unable to play. As a result the Mount Albert – Marist match which was scheduled for the number 2 field was moved to the main field with a 3:10 kickoff. H Tate refereed his 50th match involving first grade teams becoming the 12th referee to achieve this feat.\nRound 13.\nCity once again defaulted their match as Auckland Rugby League still required Eugene Donovan to apologise to the referee and an apology was not forthcoming, City arguing that Donovan's version of events differed from those given by the referee and also that the referee (Kelly) did not ask for an apology.\nRound 14.\nHarold Milliken, former All Black turned out for the first time for Mount Albert in their match with North Shore which was drawn 10-10. He had switched codes in 1940 when he joined the Papakura senior side. The suspension of Eugene Donovan was lifted by the Auckland Rugby League, but ironically their opponent, Newton, defaulted the match which was due to be played at Walker Park. Newton was still winless to this point in the season.\nRound 15.\nThere was no individual scoring reported from the match at Fowlds Park in Morningside where Manukau beat Newton 29 to 10.\nRound 16.\nGoing into this round, with 3 remaining the top of the table was extremely competitive with teams on 22, 20, 20, 20, 18, and 18 competition points. Crucially Manukau, who had been in first place lost to Marist, while near rivals Mount Albert and City both won levelling all 3 teams on 22 points. Otahuhu who had been on 20 competition points faltered with a loss also. There was no individual scoring reported in the match at the Devonport Domain between North Shore and Richmond.\nRound 17.\nDuring the week the league expressed their sympathy to the family of W.J. Gibbons who had died. He had been a former time keeper for games. Norm Johnson of Otahuhu was ordered off in their match with City. The match between Manukau and Point Chevalier was played at Onehunga School which was the first time a senior first grade match had been played at a school.\nRound 18.\nWith City and Mount Albert both winning and Manukau losing it meant that the two former teams were tied on 26 competition points with Manukau dropping into third. With the round robin completed it meant that City and Mount Albert had to play off for the Fox Memorial title for 1944. Richmond scored their 4,000 first grade point in their 26-9 win over Otahuhu. There was no mention of any score from the Point Chevalier match against Newton at Walker Park in Point Chevalier. With both teams at the foot of the table it is possible that the match was not played. Referee Jack Hawkes officiated in his 50th match involving first grade sides, becoming the 13th Auckland referee to do so up until this point.\nChampionship final.\nFollowing the final round of the championship the league decided to play the final 3 weeks later due to representative fixtures being played prior. This led to a protest letter from the Mount Albert club who felt the gap was too long and that the final should have \"priority over other fixtures\". Future New Zealand representative Warwick Clarke was ruled out for city due to injury. A Jones, the Mount Albert five eighth was also said to be unavailable due to injury but ultimately did play and scored a try for the losing Mount Albert side. City proved too strong winning 17-7 to claim their first title since 1925.\nRoope Rooster.\nSemi finals.\nPonsonby fielded Gordon Littlejohn who had been a long time Manukau rugby player and represented Auckland in 1943. Brian Nordgren also debuted for them after switching codes. In 1945 he would score over 200 points for Ponsonby and was signed by Wigan, where he played for over a decade. Late in the match Mount Albert's Richard Shadbolt was sent off for fighting. It was the fourth time that he had been sent off in senior rugby league. He had been cautioned three times already and had \"a final serious talking to\" before the final incident. The league decided to \"severely warn\" him.\n \nRoope Rooster final.\nPlaying for Ponsonby were Darcy Bailey, a former Canterbury rugby representative and J.W. Priest, a former Taranaki rugby representative. For North Shore, Arthur L. Read, a former Poverty Bay rugby player also played. North Shore led 10-3 at halftime before a big comeback by Ponsonby which won the second half 16 to 3 to claim their 6th Roope Rooster title 19 points to 13.\nStormont Shield final.\nCity's win was their first ever Stormont Shield title since its inception in 1925.\nTop try scorers and point scorers.\nThe try and point scoring lists were compiled from Fox Memorial, Roope Rooster, Phelan Shield, and Stormont Shield matches. Ron McGregor was in his second season for Richmond and led all try scorers with 14. B Lowther of Richmond was the leading try scorer with 14, with Bruce Graham and Roy Nurse scoring 12 each. Basil Cranch (Mt Albert) finished with the most points once again with 92. C Riley of Otahuhu scored 80 and was also awarded a medal for being a top goal kicker. Prolific scorer Alan Donovan finished third with 76. There were however 2 matches that received no reported individual scoring. They were the match between Richmond and North Shore, won by Richmond 8-5 and Manukau's 29-10 win over Newton.\nLower grades.\nDespite no coverage of lower grade competitions the Ellerslie United club advertised the opponents and venue of their lower grade sides throughout the season and so the following lists of teams in those particular grades have been compiled. On October 21 Newton beat Point Chevalier 28-8 to win the third grade knockout competition. On the same day the Point Chevalier senior schoolboy side won the seven-a-side knockout competition which was at Carlaw Park. They were awarded a Bantam Rooster which had been taxidermied and was donated by C.P. Moore. It was mounted on a stand holding wooden footballs and the idea for it had come from the Roope Rooster competition. Eight teams were involved with the players weighing less than 5st 7lb. The fourth grade knockout final was won by Otahuhu when they defeated Ellerslie 15-8.\nSenior B.\nUnknown if there was a senior B grade.\nSecond grade.\nUnknown if there was a second grade.\nThird grade.\nWon by Newton Rangers. Other competing teams included: Ellerslie, Glenora, Green Lane, Mount Albert, Otahuhu, Point Chevalier, and Ponsonby.\nFourth grade.\nWon by Ōtāhuhu Rovers.

        "title": "Oscar Rodríguez (Puerto Rican baseball player)",
        "text": "Hilario Oscar Rodríguez (June 28, 1931 – April 9, 2000) was a former professional baseball player. Despite never having reached the United States' Major Leagues Baseball sports league, Rodríguez is notable as the first and, as of 2023, only Puerto Rican to be inducted to the Mexican Professional Baseball Hall of Fame, having been inducted in 1993.\nBaseball career.\nRodríguez began playing as a professional baseball player (a \"pelotero\" in Spanish) in 1951, at age 20, for the Middlesboro Athletics of Middlesboro, Kentucky. In 374 at-bats (batting opportunities) during the 83 games he participated at that season, he collected 104 hits, including 13 doubles, 3 triples and 6 home-runs, for a hitting average of .276. His totals in runs batted in (RBI's) and bases stolen during 1951 and 1952 are unknown because during that era, those statistical areas were not counted by some baseball teams, including the Middlesboro one.\nIn 1955, he played for two unspecified teams on two different leagues. Rodriguez played four more minor leagues seasons as a member of the Waco-Longview Pirates (which in 1954 changed their name to the Waco Pirates) and the Middlesboro Athletics, before traveling to Mexico to play with the Mexico City Tigers. His first season as a \"Tigre\", Rodríguez had 423 at-bats, collecting 107 hits with 62 runs batted in, 74 runs scored and 4 bases stolen. Among those 107 hits, there were 32 extra-base hits, of which 15 were doubles, 9 were triples and 8 were home-runs.\nRodríguez found his stride at the Mexican league; he became an all-star there and a celebrity in Mexico.\nIn 1958, Rodríguez played for two Mexican teams, the one in Yucatan and once again, the Leones de Ciudad Mexico, hitting 14 home-runs in what became the first of a number of consecutive seasons in which he reached double figures in home-runs.\n1959 saw Rodríguez swat 22 home-runs in the Mexican League, playing for the Nuevo Laredo and Veracruz teams.\nFor the next seven seasons (1960 to 1966), Rodríguez played for the Pericos de Puebla, a team in the central Mexico city of Puebla. He was a consistent performer with the \"Pericos\", recording 91 home-runs for an average of 18 home-runs per year (stats were not kept by the Mexican League during the 1963 and 1964 seasons, so there is a possibility that he might have hit more home-runs and had a better home-run per-season average during those seven years) while hitting 655 hits, which also included 130 doubles and 22 triples, stealing 15 bases and collecting 413 RBIs, totals that, during that seven year stretch, were, due to the above-mentioned situation, probably higher also.\nWith Rodríguez as a member, the \"Pericos\" became a Mexican Baseball League powerhouse; they won the league championship in 1963 and were runner-ups in 1964 and 1965.\nSimultaneous to his career in Mexico, Rodríguez established himself as a player in the Puerto Rican winter baseball league. Playing seventeen years there from 1951 to 1968, Rodríguez participated with Ponce Lions, Mayaguez Indians and San Juan Metros, collecting 712 hits, with 99 doubles, 27 triples and 26 home-runs in the league, whose schedule usually consist of a relatively short number of games, about 40 games a season. Nevertheless, he was a star in his home-country.\nAfter the 1966 Mexican league season, Rodríguez went to play for the Broncos de Reynosa in the north-eastern Mexican city of Reynosa, in Tamaulipas state. With that team, Rodríguez shared playing time with, among others, American pitcher Frank Barnes and with Pancho Herrera. Rodríguez played three years in Reynosa, including the 1969 season, where he also spent time playing with the A-league Cameroneros de Ciudad del Carmen team (where he also played alongside Herrera and with Vince Gonzales), deciding to retire afterwards.\nCareer stats.\nA versatile player who saw action as a first baseman, third baseman, outfielder and pitcher, Rodríguez played in 2,341 combined games across the leagues where he was signed at, connecting 2,079 hits for an average of almost one hit a game in 6,592 at bats, with 379 double-base hits, 29 triple-base ones and 173 home-run ones (of those home-runs, 129 were connected in games played at the Mexican or Puerto Rican leagues) along with 1,026 runs batted in, 84 stolen bases against 13 times being caught stealing, and 723 bases-on-balls or \"walks\". Rodríguez's career hitting average was of .307 in the U.S. minor leagues, and of .331 in international (Mexico and Puerto Rico) leagues. He was also hit by pitches a total of 44 times."

It was the biggest tournament played to the Sheffield code and the equivalent of the FA Cup, which at the time was mostly confined to the south of England.\nBackground.\nThe Sheffield Football Association was founded in 1867 and took a subscription of 5 shillings from its member clubs in order to entitle them to entry. Sheffield F.C. did not enter, as the club was concentrating on national matches.\nThe Sheffield rules in force at the time had four main differences to the Association laws:\nAt the time, neither the Association nor Sheffield codes prescribed the number of players per side, and the size of the teams was a matter for negotiation between the captains or the relevant tournament rules. By 1876, most matches were 11 per side, and this was the rule in the FA Cup. For this tournament, the Sheffield FA mandated 12 men per side, as did the Birmingham Senior Cup the same year.\nFormat.\nThe competition was organized as a straight knockout tournament, with replays to a conclusion. The captains would toss for choice of venue, the captain who lost the toss could choose the venue for a replay, and second replays were to be at the first captain's choice again.\nResults.\nThird round.\nThe ties in the third round and semi-finals were due to be played at Bramall Lane, but the third round ties were all played according to the captain's toss rule. Curiously, all three ties went the way of the away side.\nSemi-finals.\nThe semi-finals were played at Bramall Lane, one after the other, before a crowd of six or seven thousand.\nFinal.\nThe final was a thriller, with Heeley taking a three-goal lead by half-time, but Wednesday fighting back to take the game to half-an-hour extra-time."

        "text": "In English cricket, the years from 1751 to 1775 are notable for the rise of the Hambledon Club and the continuing spread of the sport across England. The \"Laws of Cricket\" underwent a re-codification in 1775, including the introduction of the leg before wicket rule and the addition of the third stump to the wicket.\nHistory.\n1751–1775.\nThe mid-century deaths of some of the game's leading patrons reduced investment and the sport seems to have regressed during the period of the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), but it underwent an evolutionary change around 1760 with the introduction of pitched delivery bowling and the consequent invention of the straight bat. Around the same time, the Hambledon Club was founded and cricket thrived under its leadership for the next 25 years. Cricket continued its spread throughout England with several references in 1751 followed by Derbyshire in 1757, Northumberland in 1766, and Wiltshire in 1769.\nIn 1769, the \"Whitehall Evening Post\" reported that a \"great match at Cricket\" was to be played at Calais in northern France.\nImpact of the Seven Years War.\nThe Seven Years' War (1756–1763) caused economic hardship in England. Consequently, it would seem, investment in cricket was considerably reduced. The British declaration of war against France was confirmed on 17 May 1756, although military operations had already begun. The war lasted until 10 February 1763 when Britain signed the Treaty of Paris with France and Spain. One outcome of the war was that Great Britain could expand its interests in India at the expense of France. The era of the British Raj began and, in time, ensured the spread of cricket throughout the sub-continent.\nThere was certainly a reduction in the number of matches recorded during the war years. There were five in 1756, all involving Dartford and including three against Hambledon – these are the earliest Hambledon matches on record. In the later years of the war, the number of eleven-a-side matches ranged from none at all in 1760 to eight in 1762. Records of only two matches have survived from the 1763 season which began soon after the war ended; a post-war recovery is discernible from 1764.\nHambledon.\nThe origin of the Hambledon Club has not been fully established but it had certainly been founded by 1764 as three matches against Chertsey are listed that season. Based at Broadhalfpenny Down, near the village of Hambledon in rural Hampshire, it was actually a social club with a wide range of activities. It is best remembered for its organisation of county cricket matches and it ran the Hampshire county teams of the period. In August 1771, the Hambledon Club played against a team called \"All England\" but lost by ten wickets.\nThe earliest known matches involving a team called Hambledon were three against Dartford in the 1756 season. The source for one of them, played on Broadhalfpenny Down, is a newspaper advert placed by the owner of a missing dog which was lost at the match. Given the uncertainty about when the Hambledon Club was founded, it is possible that some kind of parish organisation was operating in 1756, perhaps led by a patron.\n1751–1763.\nFollowing the death of the Duke of Richmond in 1750, cricket lost another key supporter when Frederick, Prince of Wales died on March 31, 1751.\nThere were two matches between Kent and an England XI on the Artillery Ground in May 1751. England won the first by nine runs and the second by an innings and nine runs. These seem to have been the last known big matches for many years as there is much less coverage of cricket in the sources after 1751.\nThe earliest references to cricket in the counties of Durham, Somerset, Warwickshire and Yorkshire all occurred in 1751. There were two matches in Yorkshire: a local game in Sheffield and one patronised by two aristocrats near Richmond.\nThe earliest known mentions of Hambledon and Broadhalfpenny Down are in August 1753 when Hambledon played a Surrey team and won by 113 runs.\nThat cricket can be a dangerous game was evident in August 1755 when a player on Kennington Common lost his right eye after being hit by the ball.\nFewer matches were played during the Seven Years' War (1756–1763). Dartford played three matches against an England XI in the 1759 season and the names of several participants are known. Dartford won two of the matches; England won one.\nThere was a report of a game being played in the Chapeltown area of Leeds on Thursday, 9 July 1761. This is the earliest mention of cricket in Leeds, following records of the game in Sheffield a decade earlier. Surviving records indicate that the Chertsey club in Surrey was active through the war years. Details of two Middlesex v Surrey games have survived from the 1763 season, which began shortly after the war ended.\n1764–1771.\nThe 1764 season marked the beginning of the \"Hambledon Era\" in earnest and it is believed to be about this time that the Hambledon Club was founded. A number of notable players are mentioned in sources for the first time, including three of the greatest 18th century players: Richard Nyren, John Small and Lumpy Stevens. Seven eleven-a-side matches between significant teams are known to have taken place. Chertsey and Hambledon, by then the leading teams in cricket, played each other three times as did teams called Norfolk and Suffolk.\nFive eleven-a-side matches were recorded in 1765 including two in Yorkshire between the Leeds and Sheffield clubs. There were only three matches in 1766 but including Sussex v Hampshire, which is the earliest reference to Hampshire as an individual county team. Seven matches were recorded in 1767 including one between Hampshire and Sussex.\n'The Blecheley Diary of the Rev. William Cole 1765-67' (edited by F.G Stokes) includes a reference to a cricket match in the diary's entry for Thursday 30 October 1766. The relevant sentence reads \"Tom engaged himself to go with Mrs Willis's servants &amp; others to Dinner at a Cricket Match at Fenny-Stratford, but I would not let him go 'till after Dinner.\" While it is true that 30 October is an unusually late time of year to be playing cricket, this is still significant in showing how popular the game was outside its early strongholds of the south-east counties and London. Both Bletchley (modern-day spelling) and Fenny Stratford are only around a mile apart, which would have made a journey by foot very easy.\nIn 1768, the earliest references to patrons John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, and Sir Horatio Mann have been found in a cricketing context. In a game between Hampshire and Kent on Broadhalfpenny Down, Hampshire batsman John Small reportedly scored \"above seven score notches\" (i.e., over 140 runs), but it is not known if it was his match total or his score in Hampshire's second innings. Hampshire totalled 131 and 194 to win the match by 144 runs. A week later, Small scored more than 80 in a match against Sussex. Reports have survived of eight eleven-a-side matches in the season.\n1769 was the last season in which the original London Cricket Club and the Artillery Ground feature prominently in the records. There were three matches between Kent and London that season, the first in Blackheath and the last two on the Artillery Ground. Kent won the first and third, London the second.\nA partial score has survived of a game between the Duke of Dorset's XI and Wrotham, played at Sevenoaks Vine in August 1769. John Minshull (\"aka\" Minchin) scored 107 for Dorset's XI in the second innings and this is the earliest century in any class of cricket that has definitely been recorded. There were eleven recorded matches in 1769. Surrey played Berkshire, winning by six runs on Datchet Common. This is the first time Berkshire is recorded as a county team and it became a strong centre of the game in the late 18th century, producing numerous players good enough to take part in major matches. On 28 September, Hambledon defeated Surrey by an innings and 41 runs after their opening batsmen, Tom Sueter and George Leer shared a century partnership of 128 for the first wicket; this was apparently a rare occurrence at the time.\nOn Thursday, 29 June 1770, the \"Middlesex Journal\" reported the death of a Mr Johnson, who was a goldsmith at London Wall. His death was \"occasioned by a blow which he received from a cricket ball on Thursday, 21 June near Islington\". Little is known of the 1770 season but there was a county match at the Artillery Ground in August when a combined London and Middlesex team played against Surrey. In October, Hambledon played Caterham on Broadhalfpenny Down and won by 57 runs.\nOn 26–27 August 1771, there was a match on the Forest Racecourse, Nottingham, between the Nottingham and Sheffield clubs. Rowland Bowen, writing in the 1965 edition of \"Wisden\", mentions the rise of cricket in the industrial cities of Leicester, Nottingham and Sheffield. Apart from London, cricket in this period was elsewhere a rural game. Bowen's view is that the trades (hose, lace and cutlery) practised in these cities provided the opportunity for contract piece work so that each man worked in his own home in his own time, outside the restrictions of the later factory system. He argues that this enabled them to play cricket during the day in summer and work at night.\n1772 season.\nThe first documented match scorecards originate from 1744, but few have been discovered prior to 1772. The scorecards for three 1772 matches have survived, and as scorecards grew more popular in the years thereafter, these three have served as the foundation for cricket's statistical record. The first match in the ESPN cricinfo database was played on 24 June 1772 between Hampshire and an England XI at Broadhalfpenny Down, near Hambledon; Hampshire won by 53 runs.\nThe other two games with surviving scorecards were England v Hampshire at Guildford and England v Hampshire at Bishopsbourne in Kent. Hampshire won the Guildford match by 62 runs and England won by two wickets at Bishopsbourne.\nThese early scorecards gave scores only with no details of dismissals or bowling. The leading runscorers in the three matches were John Small of Hampshire, who totalled 213 in six innings with a highest score of 78 in the first match, and William Yalden of England, who scored 136 in six innings with a highest of 68 at Guildford."

        "text": "In English cricket, the period from 1776 to 1800 saw significant growth and development in English cricket to the point that it became a popular sport nationwide, having outgrown its origin in the south-eastern counties. Prominent northern clubs were established at Nottingham and Sheffield. \nHistory.\nCricket has its first documented mentions in Canada (1785) and the West Indies (1780; in Barbados). British clubs were established in India in Calcutta (1792) and, following the siege there, Seringapatam (1799). In America, the game was popular among soldiers in the revolution and George Washington is known to have played in at least one game.\nAt the highest level of English cricket, two clubs pre-dominated – Hambledon from the early 1770s until the late 1780s and then Marylebone Cricket Club, known as MCC, from its foundation in 1787. County cricket thrived during the Hambledon period. The Hambledon Club organised matches played by the Hampshire team, who often challenged teams representing the rest of England. Soon after its foundation, MCC assumed ownership of the \"Laws\" and re-drafted them in 1788.\nLeading players of the period included batsmen John Small and Billy Beldham; bowlers Lumpy Stevens and David Harris; and the controversial all-rounder Lord Frederick Beauclerk. Throughout the period, underarm bowling prevailed by means of a pitched delivery, this method having been recently introduced in the 1760s. In response to pitching of the ball, the modern straight bat had been created, replacing the old \"hockey stick\" design that had been in use when balls were bowled all along the ground."

        "title": "History of English cricket (1846–1863)",
        "text": "In English cricket, the years 1846–1863 were the main period of the sport's \"roundarm era\". Although roundarm had been legalised amid great controversy, its timespan was relatively short. By 1863, there was an increasing demand for the legalisation of overarm bowling and this was achieved on 10 June 1864.\nTaking advantage of the \"railway boom\", the professional travelling elevens began to tour the country, staging matches against local teams before large crowds. The first of these was the All-England Eleven (the AEE), founded by William Clarke in 1846 and then managed by George Parr following Clarke's death. The rival United All England Eleven (the UEE) was established by Jemmy Dean and John Wisden in 1852. Travelling took on a global aspect when, for the first time, an international England team was formed to undertake the first overseas tours to North America in 1859 (this was, in fact, by a combined AEE/UEE team) and Australia in 1861–62.\nIn 1846 there were only four definitive county clubs. Sussex County Cricket Club was the oldest, having been founded in 1839. It had been followed by Nottinghamshire in 1841, Cambridgeshire in 1844 and Surrey in 1845. Kent County Cricket Club had a complex history with separate organisations founded in 1842 and 1859 – these merged to form the present Kent club in 1870. Yorkshire, Hampshire and Middlesex were all founded in 1863.\nEngland Elevens.\nSocial conditions, especially the railways, were a key factor in the creation of the travelling All-England Eleven (the AEE). The team was founded in Nottingham by William Clarke. Taking advantage of the \"railway boom\", they travelled throughout Great Britain and were a significant factor in the spread of cricket. The first AEE match was against a Sheffield XX in September and they played others in Manchester and Leeds. The original AEE team was: William Clarke, Jemmy Dean, William Dorrinton, Fuller Pilch, Alfred Mynn, Joe Guy, Will Martingell, Tom Sewell, George Butler, Villiers Smith and William Hillyer. Other players who represented the AEE in its early days included George Parr, William Lillywhite, Nicholas Felix, William Denison, Thomas Box and Oliver Pell.\nIn 1852, the United All England Eleven (the UEE) was established as a rival to the AEE. Jemmy Dean and John Wisden were the main organisers and other players to represent the UEE in its early years included John Lillywhite, Tom Lockyer, Jem Grundy, F. P. Miller, Will Mortlock and Tom Sherman.\nIn 1857, the AEE and UEE began an annual series of matches against each other that continued until 1869. The fixture was the most important of the season while it lasted. Two games were played in 1857, both at Lord's and both won by the AEE whose players in 1857 included George Parr (captain), Alfred Diver, H. H. Stephenson, Julius Caesar, Cris Tinley, George Anderson, Ned Willsher and John Jackson. UEE players in 1857 included: John Wisden (captain), Jemmy Dean, Jem Grundy, William Caffyn, John Lillywhite, Tom Lockyer, Will Mortlock and Will Martingell. Also in 1857, the Cricketers Fund Friendly Society was instituted and, for ten years, the great match between the AEE and the UEE was played in its support.\nOn 7 September 1859, the departure of cricket's first-ever touring team. A photograph was taken on board ship before they sailed from Liverpool. The team of English professionals went to North America and played five matches, winning them all. There were no top-class fixtures. The 12-man squad was: George Parr (captain), James Grundy, John Jackson (all of Nottinghamshire); Robert Carpenter, Alfred Diver, Thomas Hayward (all of Cambridgeshire); Julius Caesar, William Caffyn, Tom Lockyer, H. H. Stephenson (all of Surrey); John Lillywhite, John Wisden (both of Sussex).\nH. H. Stephenson (Surrey) captained the first English team to tour Australia. The other players were William Caffyn, Will Mortlock, George Griffith, William Mudie, Tom Sewell Jr (all Surrey); Roger Iddison, Ned Stephenson (both Yorkshire); Tom Hearne, Charles Lawrence (both Middlesex); George Wells (Sussex); and George Bennett (Kent). H. H. Stephenson and Caffyn had toured America in 1859. They were abroad from October 1861 until May 1862. One top-class match was played and twelve, mostly against odds of at least 18 to 11, that were non-top-class.\nMatches, venues and teams.\nAccording to the Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians (the ACS), a total of 534 top-class matches were played in the eighteen English seasons from 1846 to 1863 inclusive. Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) were especially prolific. There was no national championship and the matches were all arranged on an \"ad hoc\" basis, although some such as Gentlemen v Players and North v South had become traditional events in the cricketing calendar. As a rule, these matches were eleven-a-side with double innings and usually played over three days.\nHaving begun in 1827, the University Match between Cambridge University Cricket Club (CUCC) and Oxford University Cricket Club (OUCC) had become an annual event by 1846 and it was played every year from then to 1863.\nKent had a strong team in the 1840s which included Nicholas Felix, William Hillyer, Alfred Mynn and Fuller Pilch.\nOn 23, 24 &amp; 25 July 1849, Sheffield Cricket Club and Manchester Cricket Club met at Hyde Park in Sheffield. For the first time, the match was billed as \"Yorkshire v Lancashire\" and it is recognised as the first Roses Match. Yorkshire won by 5 wickets.\nMiddlesex re-emerged as a county team in 1850, largely through the efforts of the Walker family that eventually founded the present Middlesex County Cricket Club.\nOn 1 March 1859, the second Kent county club was formed and based at Maidstone. This club was commonly called West Kent while the existing Canterbury one, formed in 1842, was known as East Kent, a scenario which reflected the Dorset/Mann teams of the 18th century. The two organisations eventually merged in 1870 to form the existing Kent County Cricket Club.\nThree county clubs were founded in 1863. On 8 January, Yorkshire County Cricket Club was founded out of the Sheffield Match Fund Committee that had been established on 7 March 1861. This was an exact parallel with the formation of Sussex County Cricket Club from a similar fund (1836–1839). Yorkshire played their inaugural top-class match against Surrey at The Oval on 4, 5 &amp; 6 June. It was a rain-affected draw, evenly balanced. Hampshire County Cricket Club was founded on 12 August. A number of previous county organisations including the famous Hambledon Club had existed in Hampshire for over a century, but none had survived indefinitely. On 15 December, Middlesex County Cricket Club was founded at a meeting in the London Tavern.\nBesides MCC, CUCC, OUCC and the new county clubs, other significant teams represented Manchester Cricket Club, Nottingham Cricket Club and Sheffield Cricket Club. There was an increase in northern matches with the three main town clubs regularly challenging each other. \nNew grounds in the period included Bramall Lane, which superseded Hyde Park in Sheffield; Old Trafford in Manchester; and Fenner's in Cambridge. Elsewhere, Lord's remained the sport's feature venue and there was increasing usage of the Magdalen Ground in Oxford; Trent Bridge in Nottingham; and The Oval in south London. The first top-class match at The Oval was Surrey Club v MCC on 25 &amp; 26 May 1846. Only 194 runs were scored in the match with a top score of 13. William Hillyer took 14 wickets to help MCC win by 48 runs. Surrey County Cricket Club played its initial top-class match v Kent at The Oval on 25 &amp; 26 June 1846, winning by 10 wickets.\nGentlemen v Players.\nBetween 1846 and 1863, a total of 26 Gentlemen v Players matches were played. Until 1856, the match was played at Lord's at least once a season. It was contested twice a season from 1857 to 1863, once at Lord's and once at The Oval. The Players won 21 of the 26 matches, the Gentlemen won four, and one match was tied.\nNorth v South.\nBefore 1846, North v South had only been played four times, the last time in 1838. The competition was revived in 1849 and was contested at least once per season until 1863, for a total of 28 encounters. It was frequently contested twice a year, with three matches in each years 1857 and 1863. The North won 16 of the 28 matches, the South won 8, and the remaining four were drawn.\nNotable cricketers.\nW. G. Grace was born on 18 July 1848 at Downend, near Bristol. \nAt Lord's, Alfred Baillie succeeded Roger Kynaston as MCC secretary in 1858 and Robert Allan Fitzgerald succeeded Baillie, who resigned due to ill health in 1863.\nActive players, administrators and other contributors of the period included:\nAchievements.\nIn a match played 27–29 May 1847 between MCC and Oxford University, William Hillyer completed the first recorded \"match double\" of 100 runs and ten wickets in a top-class game, scoring 26 and 83 and taking thirteen wickets. The feat was not accomplished again until 1859 by V. E. Walker. Since then, it has been accomplished numerous times, most frequently by W. G. Grace.\nIn 1850, John Wisden bowled all ten batsmen in one innings, playing for North v South at Lord's.\nOn 27 July 1852, John Sherman made his final top-class appearance for Manchester v. Sheffield at Hyde Park, Sheffield. His career had spanned 44 seasons from his debut at Lord's on 20 September 1809 when he played for Beauclerk's XI v. Ladbroke's XI. His was the longest top-class career span, equalled only by W. G. Grace.\nOn 21, 22 &amp; 23 July 1859, V. E. Walker of Middlesex, playing for England v. Surrey at The Oval, took all ten wickets in the Surrey first innings and followed by scoring 108 in the England second innings, having been the not out batsman in the first (20*). He took a further four wickets in Surrey's second innings. England won by 392 runs.\nRules and equipment history.\nIn 1846, Lord's introduced the Telegraph Score Board, and scorecards were sold for the first time. The first mowing machinery were employed on cricket fields around 1850, but sheep were still utilized at Lord's for many years after that. The simple wicket-keeping gloves gave way to the now-famous cushioned gauntlets. The follow-on differential was lowered to 80 in 1854. (60 in a one-day match).\nJem Grundy became the first player to be given out handled the ball when playing for MCC v Kent at Lord's in 1857.\nIn 1859, the earliest reference has been found of a hat being presented to a bowler who had taken wickets with three successive deliveries, hence hat-trick.\nOn 26 August 1862, Surrey played against an England XI at The Oval. Edgar Willsher of England was no-balled six times in succession by John Lillywhite (son of William Lillywhite) for bowling with his hand above the shoulder. For some years previously, Willsher and others had bowled in this way and the incident at The Oval put the issue into context. The drama was exaggerated when Willsher and the other eight professionals in the England team walked off the field. Play continued next day but with a replacement umpire. Compared with the introduction of roundarm, this controversy was short-lived and overarm bowling was legalised in 1864.\nMCC and Lord's.\nLord's hosted the last Public Schools Weeks (Eton, Harrow, and Winchester) in 1854.\nAlfred Baillie replaced Roger Kynaston as MCC Secretary in 1858. Kynaston has been in charge since 1842. Robert Allan Fitzgerald replaced Baillie, who resigned due to illness, in 1863. Fitzgerald became the first paid secretary on January 1, 1867, and held the position until 1876.\nThe Eyre Estate sold the freehold of Lord's to Isaac Moses, a property trader, at public auction in 1860 for £7,000. MCC did not submit a bid. James Dark held the leasehold until 1864, when he ceded it to MCC, who afterwards purchased the freehold from Mr Moses at a substantial profit.\nSingle wicket.\nIn 1846, the last match played for the Single Wicket Championship was between Alfred Mynn and Nicholas Felix.\nThe last top-class single wicket event was held in 1848.\nLiterature.\nPublication in 1862 of volumes 1–4 of \"Scores and Biographies\", compiled by Arthur Haygarth. This work recorded the full scores of all discoverable matches from 1744 onwards."

However, it wasn't until the 1950s that handball began to gain popularity in Russia.\nSoviet Union Era.\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, the Soviet Union dominated international handball competitions, winning several world championships one in men and three in women, in the Olympic they won two gold in women and three in men. Some of the most successful Soviet handball players of that era included Aleksandr Tuchkin, Andrey Lavrov, Aleksandr Anpilogov, Aleksandr Karshakevich, Serhiy Kushniryuk, Vladimir Kravtsov, Vyacheslav Atavin, Voldemaras Novickis.\nPresent Russia.\nFollowing the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia continued to be a strong force in international handball. The country's national handball team has won several medals in major international competitions, including the Olympics, World Championships, and European Championships.\nIn recent years, Russian handball has been dominated by clubs such as Lada Handball, Dinamo Volgograd, and Zvezda Zvenigorod which have won multiple titles in the EHF club Competitions.\nOverall, handball has a strong following in Russia, with many talented players and teams competing at both the national and international levels.\n2022 Suspension of Russia.\nIn reaction to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the International Handball Federation banned Russian and Belarus athletes and officials, and the European Handball Federation suspended the national teams of Russia and Belarus as well as Russian and Belarusian clubs competing in European handball competitions. Referees, officials, and commission members from Russia and Belarus will not be called upon for future activities. And new organisers will be sought for the YAC 16 EHF Beach Handball EURO and the Qualifier Tournaments for the Beach Handball EURO 2023, which were to be held in Moscow."

He signed 13 players from London Skolars. Three were former Broncos players in Iliess Macani, Jordan Willams and Dalton Grant, whilst 38 year old Neil Thorman had Super League experience in the distant past. However Paulos Latu, Jacob Thomas, Will Ramsey, Rob Tuliatu, Adam Vranhos, Michael Greenhalgh, Judd Greenhalgh, Lameck Juma and Ronny Palumbo appeared to have only played in the third tier for the Skolars. Other signings like Dan Coates and reserve centre Jude Ferreira seemed also to have played in the lower leagues, as did the likes of Rian Horsman, Max Allen, Jack Howorth and Euan Parke.\nLondon Broncos first game against Widnes with a weak third division standard side saw the Broncos conceding 3 times from the first 4 attacking sets, as cited at https://widnesvikings.co.uk/event/london-broncos-v-widnes-vikings/\nBy the end of his tenure, the Broncos were in the relegation zone, fielding the likes of 38 year old Halfback Neil Thorman and in very poor form; the team had managed just one win versus Dewsbury and one draw at Barrow from their league games under Coleman as cited at https://www.loverugbyleague.com/post/london-broncos-looking-for-new-full-time-head-coach-as-coleman-departs\nHe and his brother Jy-Mel were both sacked in May 2022.\nInternational career.\nColeman coached Jamaica for two games in 2016, beating Ireland in Dublin and drawing with Wales.\nHe is the secondary coach for Jamaica under Director of Rugby Romeo Monteith at the 2021 Rugby League World Cup."

        "title": "2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup final was an association football match that determined the winner of the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup. The match was played at the Stadium Australia in Sydney, Australia, on 20 August 2023, and was contested by Spain and England. It took place in front of 75,784 supporters, and Spain won the final 1–0 through a goal from Olga Carmona, assisted by Mariona Caldentey.\nFor both finalists, this was the first appearance in a Women's World Cup final. Both teams were looking to become only the second country to win both men's and women's World Cups – Germany accomplished the feat in 2003 – as well as becoming the first team representing UEFA to win the tournament since Germany in 2007. This was the third all-European final in the Women's World Cup, after the 1995 and 2003 finals, both of which were also contested between potential new champions.\nBackground.\nBoth teams were making their Women's World Cup final debut. Spain had appeared in two previous Women's World Cups and advanced as far as the round of 16 in 2019. England had played in five previous Women's World Cups and achieved their best prior performance in 2015, when they finished third.\nThis final was the third all-European final in Women's World Cup history after 1995 — when Norway won their first title by beating Germany in Stockholm — and 2003 — when Germany won their first title via a golden goal against Sweden in the United States to become the first country to have won both senior World Cups; at the time, their men's team had won three world titles. The winner of the 2023 final would become the first European team to win the tournament since Germany in 2007. The winners would also be the first new Women's World Cup champions since Japan in 2011.\nThis was the seventeenth meeting between the two teams: England had been more successful, with seven victories to Spain's three, and six draws. Three of those matches had been in a major tournament, all at the UEFA Women's Championship. Spain won their first Euros encounter, with England winning the last two matches at the 2017 and the 2022 tournaments respectively.\nSpain's Jorge Vilda managed in his fourth consecutive major championship and the second in the Women's World Cup. He became the first man to manage a Women's World Cup-winning side since Norio Sasaki with Japan in 2011 and the first European man since Even Pellerud in 1995 to win it.\nEngland manager Sarina Wiegman was also at her fourth consecutive major championship, and fourth consecutive final after winning the 2017 Euros and finishing as runners-up in the 2019 Women's World Cup with her native Netherlands in addition to winning the Women's Euro 2022 with England. She was the first person to lead different nations in multiple men's or women's World Cup finals and seeking to become the first manager to win either tournament with a foreign national team. As she lost, she became the first manager to lose two successive World Cup finals.\nVenue.\nThe final was held at Stadium Australia (also known as Accor Stadium) in Sydney, New South Wales. The venue has a capacity of 75,784, and hosted four matches during the World Cup which included a semi-final. The stadium was confirmed to be the host of the final when the final stadiums for the World Cup was confirmed on the 31 March 2021. \nBuilt for the 2000 Summer Olympics, it opened in March 1999. In addition to the opening and closing ceremonies and the track and field events, the stadium hosted the men's football gold medal match. The venue was also chosen as a venue for the men's 2015 AFC Asian Cup, where it hosted seven matches including the final, which Australia won against South Korea to win the tournament for the first time. It was also the host of the 2005 shootout victory over Uruguay in the OFC–CONMEBOL playoff, which qualified the Socceroos for the 2006 World Cup, their first appearance since 1974.\nRoute to the final.\nSpain.\nSpain first qualified to a major women's tournament in 1997, reaching the semi-finals of their first European Championship, and qualified for their first Women's World Cup in 2015. Their previous best performance in the Women's World Cup was elimination in the round of 16 in 2019.\nHeading into the tournament, Spain was ranked sixth in the FIFA Women's World Ranking. They were drawn in group C with Costa Rica, Zambia and 2011 champions Japan. Their opening match of the World Cup was against Costa Rica saw an own goal from Costa Rican player Valeria del Campo before goals from Aitana Bonmatí and Esther González in the space of four minutes secured a 3–0 victory. In the following match day, Spain booked a spot in the knockout stage with a 5–0 over Zambia with the opening goal being scored in the ninth minute by Teresa Abelleira before two goals from Alba Redondo and Jennifer Hermoso who was playing her 100th match got the victory. The final match day against Japan saw their Spanish be counterattacked with two goals from Japanese striker Hinata Miyazawa giving Japan a 4–0 win and placing Spain in second place for the group.\nIn the round of 16, Spain took on Group A winners Switzerland. Bonmatí scored the opening goal in the 7th minute before an own goal from Laia Codina who back-passed to Cata Coll which gave the equaliser for Switzerland. The following 30 minutes saw Spain score three goals with Redondo, Bonmati and Codina all scoring to give Spain a 4–1 lead at half-time. After Switzerland almost a second goal from Meriame Terchoun, Spain sealed up the match with a fifth coming from Hermoso and securing a spot into the quarter-finals for the first time. Spain's quarter-final opponent was against the Netherlands who finished runner-up at the 2019 World Cup. The opening half saw the Spanish have a goal disallowed while the Dutch had a penalty being waved away. In the 81st minute, Mariona Caldentey scored from the penalty spot to give Spain the early lead after Stefanie van der Gragt had a hand touch the ball. Van der Gragt, who moved forward, got the equaliser nine minutes later with an assist from Victoria Pelova, putting the game into extra time. On the 111th minute, Salma Paralluelo scored the match winner and booked a semi-final spot. In the semis at Eden Park, Spain faced Sweden. They scored first through Paralluelo, before conceding an equaliser by Rebecka Blomqvist. Just a minute later, Olga Carmona scored a wonderful goal to send Spain to only its second senior World Cup final ever and the first since the men's 2010 triumph over the Netherlands in Johannesburg.\nEngland.\nEngland first qualified to a major women's tournament in 1984, finishing as runners-up in the European Championship. They first qualified for the Women's World Cup in 1995. Their previous best performance in the tournament was finishing third in 2015.\nHeading into the tournament, the Lionesses had not only won their first major trophy at Women's Euro 2022 as hosts but also had gone on to defeat Copa América Femenina winners Brazil on penalties at Wembley in the first Women's Finalissima. They had lost once with Sarina Wiegman as manager – a 2–0 friendly defeat to Australia in Brentford – and entered the Women's World Cup ranked fourth in the FIFA Women's World Ranking. They were drawn in Group D with Haiti, Denmark, and 1999 runners-up China. In the first two games, England won 1–0 against both Haiti and Denmark; the winning goals were a penalty from Georgia Stanway and a goal from Lauren James. Needing a point to win the group, England defeated China 6–1 with James scoring two goals.\nIn the round of 16, England faced group B runners-up Nigeria. During the match, the English were outplayed against the Nigerians. After initially getting a yellow card, James was then sent off after a VAR check for stepping on Michelle Alozie's back. After a goalless 120 minutes, the match went into penalties. After Stanway's shot went wide, the next four penalties were slotted in and with Nigeria missing two in return, England won the shoot-out 4–2. England next match was against Colombia who were playing in their first quarter-final at the World Cup. After Leicy Santos scored, England quickly equalised through Hemp before the first half ended. A 63rd-minute goal from Alessia Russo won the Lionesses a spot in the semis to face co-hosts Australia. Ella Toone scored first, but Australia equalised through Sam Kerr. Hemp and Russo then scored to secure England a first Women's World Cup final and only its second senior World Cup final ever, the first since the men's 1966 triumph over West Germany in London.\nPre-match.\nOfficials.\nOn 18 August 2023, FIFA named American official Tori Penso as the referee for the final. She became the first American referee to officiate a World Cup final after previously being the head referee for four matches of the World Cup including the semi-final between Australia and England, thus becoming the third referee ever and the first since Ivan Eklind in the 1934 men's World Cup to officiate a single World Cup semi-final and the final. Penso had been a FIFA international referee since 2021, refereed the 2021 NWSL Championship Game and had also become the first female referee in Major League Soccer history. Her assistants, Brooke Mayo and Kathryn Nesbitt, were also from the United States. They were joined by fourth official Yoshimi Yamashita of Japan.\nTeam selection.\nFrom their 2022 Women's Euro team that beat Spain in Brighton and Hove before winning that tournament, England could not call up captain Leah Williamson, player of the tournament and top scorer Beth Mead, or Fran Kirby due to knee injuries. The World Cup squad included some returning senior players and new young players instead. One of the young players called up after the 2022 Euro, Lauren James, was available to play in the final after a straight red card against Nigeria in the round of 16 resulted in her being suspended for the quarter-final and semi-final.\nFollowing the 2022 Euro, a group of 15 Spain players boycotted matches due to a dispute with the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) and manager Jorge Vilda. Several continued to boycott, with others excluded, and only 3 of the 15 were included in the World Cup squad. Two-time reigning Ballon d'Or Féminin winner Alexia Putellas was available for the tournament after recovering from an ACL injury. Oihane Hernández was available for the final after having accumulated two yellow cards and missing the semi-final.\nBoth of the teams were considered golden generations of the women's game in their countries, though each missing key players through the injuries and boycott.\nThe combined tournament squads of England and Spain featured eleven players who, at the time the match was played, were signed to Barcelona; ten (eight for Spain, two for England) played in the final. The teammates had joked about meeting each other in the final, without truly expecting it. Ahead of the match, the awareness of each others' strengths and weaknesses was a point of discussion, as were the Barcelona players who had refused to play for Spain.\nRepresentatives.\nBoth England (as part of the United Kingdom and Commonwealth) and Spain are constitutional monarchies and are often represented at sporting events by members of their royal families. At the time, the president of the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) was Luis Rubiales, while William, Prince of Wales was president of The Football Association (The FA). Despite his position in football and as royalty, William said he would not travel to Australia (of which he is also royalty) to watch England in the final, citing the carbon footprint that would be generated.\nRubiales had accompanied the Spain team throughout much of their time in New Zealand and Australia, with a report in Relevo suggesting he had imposed his presence around the players too closely, behaving more like a teammate than the president, and had normalised a level of paternalism and condescension. Spain's Queen Letizia travelled to Australia for the final with her younger daughter, the Infanta Sofía. Included in the trip over her sister, Sofía is known to be a big fan of football as well as reportedly an aspiring defensive midfielder. The director of women's football for Barcelona, Xavi Puig, was also in attendance and allowed to accompany the Spain team, though stated to be supporting all the club's players.\nClosing ceremony.\nThe tournament's closing ceremony took place ahead of the final, featuring a Welcome to Country, and a performance from Australian singer Tones and I.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nThe match was described as a \"pulsating game\", difficult but with Spain creating more clear chances by the end.\nEngland started the match intensely, with Spain patient; the first shot of the game came in the 5th minute from England forward Lauren Hemp shooting straight at Spain goalkeeper Cata Coll. Spain took advantage of the transition a minute later to launch a counterattack that saw centre forward Alba Redondo send in a loose cross. England then created chances with balls played through the lines to centre forward Alessia Russo; when Spain got the ball they held possession without taking advantage. After England holding midfielder Keira Walsh was fouled by Salma Paralluelo attempting to dispossess her, the England team created their best chance of the match, with Hemp having a clear shot on goal in the 16th minute but striking the crossbar. The match \"sprung into life\" when Spain made their first substantial attack a minute later, with vice-captain Olga Carmona crossing a ball to Paralluelo, who could not connect fully but sent the ball into the path of Redondo: England goalkeeper Mary Earps made a quick-moving save to catch the shot from Redondo. Over the next few minutes, the match was played from end to end, with chances in for both teams.\nWhen England right wing-back Lucy Bronze attempted a dribble through the midfield, Spanish players dispossessed her and the ball was sent to Carmona, who took a tight-angled low shot past Earps and into the right corner of the net, scoring the only goal of the match in the 29th minute. Spanish media noted that although Spain's team featured more players from Barcelona than any other club, the goal did not come from possession play but from a quick counterattack, more like the play of Real Madrid, which the Spain women's team had increasingly played like. England struggled after conceding the goal, allowing a confident Spain more chances, though Spain's only shot on target in the rest of the half came when defender Irene Paredes was given space in the box to head the ball from a free kick in the 37th minute, which Earps kept out. England recovered close to the end of the first half, and a long ball to Hemp was crossed in for Ella Toone with an empty goal in the 42nd minute, though Toone failed to connect and the ball was recovered by Spain; the same sequence was used minutes later, with Spain sending players into the box to clear Hemp's cross. In the one minute of added time at the end of the first half, Paralluelo also hit the crossbar.\nReturning from half time, England changed formation from the 3–5–2 that they had adopted in the group stage, returning to the 4–3–3 they had consistently used under Wiegman throughout her tenure. Wingers Lauren James and Chloe Kelly came on for left wing-back Rachel Daly and Russo. The change initially saw England improve defensively and create better opportunities, including the fullbacks continuing to play forward; Spain substituted centre forward Redondo for defensive player Oihane Hernández in the 60th minute, with Spain attacking midfielder Aitana Bonmatí trying to score from range in the 62nd minute. England's confidence waned and Spain's was bolstered when Walsh conceded a penalty for accidental handball in the box while defending a corner in the 65th minute. After a lengthy VAR review, Spain forward Jennifer Hermoso took the penalty in the 70th minute, with the shot saved by Earps. Spain defender Laia Codina was treated and eventually substituted with an injury in the 73rd minute, being replaced by captain Ivana Andrés. England briefly found form again after the substitution, with James able to send in a tight-angled shot narrowly saved by Coll, but were hampered by defender Alex Greenwood receiving a head injury from Paralluelo's high knee in the 78th minute. Greenwood managed to continue, with play resuming in the 82nd minute and England playing desperately.\nSpain had the better of the game for the rest of the 90, and when Hermoso required treatment, England replaced Toone with striker Bethany England in the 87th minute. An attempt from Hermoso was impressively blocked by Jess Carter in the 89th minute, before Alexia Putellas was brought on for Mariona Caldentey in the 90th. Accounting for the VAR and treatment time, there were 13 minutes of added time at the end of the match. England continued to play desperately, leaving defensive gaps, with Earps saving a low shot from Spain fullback Ona Batlle in the 92nd minute. Spain used their control to slow the game and frustrate England, with England's only chance in the added time being a weak Kelly cross cleared by Spain's ample defense; Spain had their own chances in added time, with a sliding block from Bronze preventing Paralluelo's shot in the 98th minute. England's attacks led to a corner taken in the 104th minute, which was held by Coll and the match ended.\nIncidents.\nIn the 23rd minute of the match, a man ran onto the field wearing an anti-Putin t-shirt, halting play briefly while England was waiting to take a free kick. The free kick was gathered by Spain, who counterattacked unsuccessfully.\nDuring a celebration when Spain scored, manager Vilda hugged a female assistant; initially having his hand on her shoulder, he appeared to move it down to her breast and hold this a moment before removing his hand. The moment was captured on camera and re-examined after the match and an incident of Rubiales kissing a player without consent.\nNear the end of the match, England player Bronze approached Vilda at the side of the pitch and remonstrated him. Coming after several fouls on England, and when Vilda and his staff were crowding the touchline, Bronze told Australian media that she \"just told them to sit down\".\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Line-ups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=Line-ups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nAftermath.\nTeams.\nSpain became the second country to have won both men's and women's World Cups and also the second country—after Brazil's male teams between 2003 and 2005—to simultaneously hold all three World Cups of the same gender (senior, under-20, and under-17). Salma Paralluelo became the first player of any gender to have won all three World Cups of the same gender. Spain's captain for the match and goalscorer Olga Carmona was named player of the match. After she scored, she lifted her shirt to reveal an undershirt with \"Merchi\" written on it, the name of her friend's mother who had recently died. In the press room after the match, she dedicated the victory to her. She was told shortly afterward that her own father had died before the match.\nThe Spain team boarded an overnight flight and returned to Madrid for a public celebration on the evening of 21 August, held at Madrid Río park with several thousand in attendance. The team's victory dominated the front pages of newspapers on 21 August, with emphatic headlines.\nThe England team stayed overnight in Sydney before returning to London, set to arrive on 22 August; the Women's Super League would not begin its season until October. Keir Starmer, the UK Leader of the Opposition, called for the team to be recognised with Honours for reaching a World Cup final, something which has precedent in men's sport. The match was also featured on the front pages of all British newspapers on 21 August, mostly using images of the team looking disappointed and headlines expressing pride at the achievement of reaching a final.\nRubiales affair.\nDuring the medal ceremony, RFEF president Luis Rubiales kissed Jennifer Hermoso on the lips, despite her visible displeasure. The action drew criticism, particularly towards the continued sexism in the sport, and calls for Rubiales's resignation. In a separate incident at the end of the match, Rubiales was filmed pointing to the Spain players before grabbing his crotch, with the obscene gesture further criticised as he was standing next to the teenage Infanta Sofía.\nAfter Hermoso had said she did not expect or like the kiss, Rubiales entered the players' dressing room, reportedly throwing his arm around Hermoso and joking about marrying her in Ibiza. While on a layover returning from Australia, Rubiales published an apology video in which he said that he had no bad intentions and was sorry for distracting from the celebration, saying: \"I have to apologise, learn from this, and understand that when you are president you have to be more careful.\"\nRubiales faced heavy criticism for his actions, and calls for him to resign came from various Spanish footballing bodies as well as the government. He and Vilda tried to make Hermoso support Rubiales, issuing a fake statement when she would not. Hermoso issued a statement through her union, Futpro, with the union saying the kiss was unacceptable and that they were working on seeing it punished. \nThe RFEF called an extraordinary general meeting for 25 August.\nBroadcasting.\nIn Spain, the World Cup was broadcast by Televisión Española (TVE), with an average of 5.6 million viewers and a peak of 8.9 million. In addition, public streaming service RTVE Play gathered almost one million viewers, with a total of 2.1 million views. Post-match celebrations were followed by 6.2 million people, with a peak of 8.7 million.\nIn the United Kingdom, the final was watched by a peak audience of 14.8 million and average of 13.3 million on BBC One and ITV1. The BBC reported 12 million peak viewers on BBC One, with an additional 3.9 million views on BBC iPlayer and BBC Sport.\nThe match was watched by a peak audience of 5.54 million viewers in Australia. It also set a record for the most viewers in the U.S. for a Women's World Cup final not involving the United States national team, with a peak audience of 2.45 million on Fox and a combined average of 2.1 million on Fox and Telemundo. The figures were a 88 percent decline from the 2019 final due to the early morning start time and early elimination of the United States."

        "text": "The opening ceremony for the 2022 Commonwealth Games took place on the evening of Thursday 28 July in the Alexander Stadium, Birmingham. As mandated by the Commonwealth Games Charter, the proceedings of the ceremony combined the formal opening of the sporting event (including hoisting of the flags, parade of the athletes and welcome speeches) with an artistic performance to showcase the host nation's culture. The 2022 Games were formally opened by Charles, Prince of Wales.\nPreparations.\nOn 25 August 2021, the Birmingham Organising Committee for the 2022 Commonwealth Games (BOCCG) announced that Birmingham Ceremonies Ltd, a joint venture formed by GBA (Gary Beestone Associates) and Done+Dusted, will produce and deliver the opening and closing ceremonies. The creative team consisted of artistic director Iqbal Khan, writer Maeve Clarke, music director Joshua ‘RTKal’ Holness, production designer Misty Buckley, broadcast director Hamish Hamilton and executive producer Steven Knight. The team was assembled by BOCCG chief creative officer Martin Green, who stated that the creative team was drawn from talents from across the UK in a diverse range of disciplines, from theatre to literature and TV to stage production.\nProceedings.\nCall to Gather.\nThe ceremony began with the introductory performance titled \"Call to Gather\", featuring main character Stella – a \"dreamer\", played by Lorell Boyce. She and 71 other performers carry shards of light, described as the fragments of the star that fall across the Commonwealth nations, which represent hopes and dreams. A combination of video footage and CGI imagery showed that as the athletes pack their shards of light into the bag, their houses floated into the sky and gather above the stadium, forming the \"courtyard of the Commonwealth\". \nWelcome of dignitaries.\nAfter the video dedicated to the Queen Elizabeth II's life was shown, a trumpet fanfare was delivered by the Royal Marines. A convoy of 72 red, white and blue cars that had direct links to the car manufacturing heritage of Birmingham entered the stadium, forming the Union Jack – the flag of the United Kingdom. Prince Charles (now King Charles III) later arrived at the stadium driving his late father's Aston Martin DB6, accompanied by his wife Camilla (now Queen Camilla). Birmingham Conservatoire graduate and mezzo-soprano Samantha Oxborough performed the National Anthem – God Save the Queen, joined by community choirs from across the region, with music by the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra led by conductor Alpesh Chauhan. The performance of the national anthem was followed by a flypast from eight aircraft of the Red Arrows led by squadron leader Tom Bould, leaving smoke trails in the colours of the National Flag – Red, White and Blue.\nEverything to Everybody.\nAfter the video footage of the Queen's Baton Relay, the creative segments continue where the introductory performance ended. The first segment was titled Everything to Everybody, telling about the history of Birmingham. Stella was seen coming out of her home on the stage, while the performers exit the cars at the stage centre, carrying with them their bags and shards of light from earlier. At the stage centre, they are surrounded by featured parkour artists, stunt cyclists and giant puppets that represented literary figures, scientists and musicians from Birmingham's history: Edward Elgar, the Lunar Men, Samuel Johnson and William Shakespeare. Charlie Chaplin accidentally sets fire to the city's first free public library, a reference to the destruction of the first Shakespeare Memorial Room in 1879. But with the shards of light crystals in hand, Stella and the performers put the fire out.\nHear My Voice.\nThe second segment Hear My Voice recognised the arrival of newcomers to Birmingham and unsung heroes of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pakistani female education activist and the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai gave her speech, expressing hope for free children education, equal rights for women and a peaceful future. An animation about her life was displayed before she walked onto the stage. Dancers from Birmingham Royal Ballet, the Elmhurst Ballet School and the Critical Mass project, Guitarist Tony Iommi, saxophonist Soweto Kinch and Birmingham-born R&amp;B vocalists Indigo Marshall and Gambimi performed the segment."

        "text": "Two human polls make up the 2022–23 NCAA Division I women's basketball rankings, the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, in addition to various publications' preseason polls.\nAP Poll.\nThe women's basketball poll began during the 1976–77 season, and was initially compiled by Mel Greenberg and published by \"The Philadelphia Inquirer\". At first, it was a poll of coaches conducted via telephone, where coaches identified top teams and a list of the Top 20 teams was produced. The contributors continued to be coaches until 1994, when the AP took over administration of the poll from Greenberg, and switched to a panel of writers. Three Texas teams were in the very first ranking in 1976: Wayland Baptist, Stephen F. Austin and Baylor. On January 23, 2023, for the first time in 47 years, no teams from Texas were in the top 25, ending an 835-week run with at least one Texas team in the rankings.\nUSA Today Coaches Poll.\nThe Coaches Poll is the second-oldest poll still in use after the AP Poll. It is compiled by a rotating group of 31 college Division I head coaches. The Poll operates by Borda count. Each voting member ranks teams from 1 to 25. Each team then receives points for their ranking in reverse order: Number 1 earns 25 points, number 2 earns 24 points, and so forth. The points are then combined and the team with the highest points is then ranked No. 1; second highest is ranked No. 2 and so forth. Only the top 25 teams with points are ranked, with teams receiving first-place votes noted the quantity next to their name. The maximum points a single team can earn is 775."

        "text": "1876 Women's Tennis Season was mainly composed of national and local amateur tournaments. This year two tennis events were staged in Dublin, Ireland and Hamilton, Bermuda between April and December 1876.\nHistory.\nBefore the birth of Open Era, most tournaments were reserved for amateur athletes. In 1874 the British Major Walter Clopton Wingfield he patented the House of London Crafts the invention of a new game, which consists of a shaped field hourglass, divided in the middle by a net suspended. The game was packaged in a box containing some balls, four paddles, the network and the signs to mark the field. The game was based on the rules of the old real tennis and, at the suggestion of Arthur Balfour, was called lawn-tennis. The official date of birth of the court would be February 23, 1874.\nThe women's amateur tennis seasons covers a period of thirty five years from 1876 to 1912. During this period there was no single international organization responsible for overseeing tennis. At the very start in tennis history lawn tennis clubs themselves organized events and some like the All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club in England (f.1877) and the Fitzwilliam Lawn Tennis Club, Ireland (f.1879) generally oversaw tennis in their respective countries.\nThis would later change when tennis players started (those that could) traveled the world to compete in events organized by individual national lawn tennis associations (NLTA)'s the oldest of which then was the United States Lawn Tennis Association (f. 1881). In certain countries that did not establish a national association until later, had provincial, regional or state lawn tennis associations overseeing tournaments in a province, region or state within a country, such as the Northern Lawn Tennis Association in Manchester, England (f.1880), had responsibility for coordinating tournaments staged by clubs in the North of England region. In Australia the Victorian Lawn Tennis Association (f.1904) organised tournaments in the state of Victoria, Australia.\nIn 1876 the very first tournaments for women were organised in Ireland and Bermuda. In Ireland an All Ireland Lawn Tennis Championships organised by the Irish Champion Athletic Club, Dublin were held between 17 and 22 July, that was won by a Miss W Casey who defeated a Miss Vance. In September 1876 a second tournament for women was staged at Hamilton. Bermuda that was won by Mary G Gray.\nThis year in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia a local sports goods supply company imported tennis equipment from England, tennis courts were laid and local competitions held for the first time. In 1876 in the United States tennis was first played in Boston Massachusetts on a private tennis court built by Hollis Hunnewell and Nathaniel Thayer. In Canada the Toronto Lawn Tennis Club was established.\nIn 1913 the International Lawn Tennis Federation was created, that consisted of national member associations. The ILTF through its associated members then became responsible for supervising a global women's tour.\nSeason results.\nNotes 1: Challenge Round: the final round of a tournament, in which the winner of a single-elimination phase faces the previous year's champion, who plays only that one match.

        "title": "History of Major League Baseball on ABC",
        "text": "The following article details the history of \"Major League Baseball on ABC\", the broadcast of Major League Baseball games on the ABC television network.\n1950s.\nIn 1953, ABC-TV executive Edgar J. Scherick (who later created \"Wide World of Sports\") broached a Saturday \"Game of the Week\", TV sport's first network series. At the time, ABC was labeled a \"nothing network\" that had fewer outlets than CBS or NBC. ABC also needed paid programming or \"anything for bills\" as Scherick put it. At first, ABC hesitated at the idea of a nationally televised regular season baseball program. ABC wondered how exactly the \"Game of the Week\" would reach television in the first place and who would notice if it did? Also, Major League Baseball barred the \"Game of the Week\" from airing within 50 miles of any ballpark. Major League Baseball according to Scherick, insisted on protecting local coverage and didn't care about national appeal. ABC, though, did care about the national appeal and claimed that \"most of America was still up for grabs.\"\nIn April 1953, Edgar Scherick set out to acquire teams rights but instead, only got the Philadelphia Athletics, Cleveland Indians, and Chicago White Sox to sign on. These were not \"national\" broadcast contracts since they were assembled through negotiations with individual teams to telecast games from their home parks. It was until the Sports Broadcasting Act of 1961, that antitrust laws barred \"pooled rights\" TV contracts negotiated with a central league broadcasting authority.\nIn 1953, ABC earned an 11.4 rating for its \"Game of the Week\" telecasts. Blacked-out cities had 32% of households. In the rest of the United States, 3 in 4 TV sets in use watched Dizzy Dean and Buddy Blattner (or backup announcers Bill McColgan and Bob Finnegan) call the games for ABC. CBS took over the Saturday \"Game\" in 1955 (the rights were actually set up through the Falstaff Brewing Corporation) retaining Dean/Blattner and McColgan/Finnegan as the announcing crews (as well as Gene Kirby, who produced the Dean/Blattner games and alternated with them on play-by-play) and adding Sunday coverage in 1957. As Edgar Scherick said, \"In '53, no one wanted us. Now teams begged for \"Game\"'s cash.\"\nIn 1959, ABC broadcast the best-of-three playoff series (to decide the National League pennant) between the Milwaukee Braves and Los Angeles Dodgers. The cigarette company L&amp;M sponsored the telecasts. George Kell and Bob DeLaney were the announcers. ABC Radio also broadcast the playoff series with Bob Finnegan and Tony Flynn announcing.\n1960s.\n1960–1961.\nIn 1960, ABC returned to baseball broadcasting with a series of late-afternoon Saturday games. Jack Buck and Carl Erskine were the lead announcing crew for this series, which lasted one season. ABC typically did three games a week. Two of the games were always from the Eastern or Central Time Zone. The late games (no doubleheaders) were usually San Francisco Giants or Los Angeles Dodgers' home games. However, the Milwaukee Braves used to start many of their Saturday home games late in the afternoon. So if the Giants and Dodgers were both on the road at the same time, ABC still would be able to show a late game.\nOne other note about ABC baseball coverage during this period. Despite temporarily losing the \"Game of the Week\" package in 1961, ABC still televised several games in prime time (with Jack Buck returning to call the action). This occurred as Roger Maris was poised to tie and subsequently break Babe Ruth's regular season home run record of 60. As with all Major League Baseball games in those days, the action was totally blacked out of major league markets. As a matter of fact, as documented in the HBO film \"61*\", the Maris family was welcomed into ABC's Kansas City, Missouri affiliate KMBC-TV so they could watch the in-house feed of the game, which was blacked out of Kansas City.\nOn September 20, 1961, Bob Neal and Hank Greenberg called a baseball game for ABC in prime time between Maris' New York Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles.\n1965.\nIn 1965, ABC provided the first-ever nationwide baseball coverage with weekly Saturday broadcasts on a regional basis. ABC paid $5.7 million for the rights to the 28 Saturday/holiday \"Games of the Week\". ABC's deal covered all of the teams except the New York Yankees and Philadelphia Phillies (who had their own television deals) and called for two regionalized games on Saturdays, Independence Day, and Labor Day. Each Saturday, ABC broadcast two 2 p.m. games and one 5 p.m. game for the Pacific Time Zone. ABC blacked out the games in the home cities of the clubs playing those games. Major League Baseball however, had a TV deal with NBC for the All-Star Game and World Series. At the end of the season, ABC declined to exercise its $6.5 million option for 1966, citing poor ratings, especially in New York.\nAccording to ABC announcer Merle Harmon's profile in Curt Smith's book \"Voices of Summer\", in 1965, CBS' \"Yankee Game of the Week\" beat ABC in the ratings in at least Dallas and Des Moines. To make matters worse, local television split the big-city audience. Therefore, ABC could show the Cubs vs. the Cardinals in the New York market, yet the Mets would still kill them in terms of viewership. Harmon, Chris Schenkel, Keith Jackson, and (on occasion) Ken Coleman served as ABC's principal play-by-play voices for this series. Also on the network's announcing team were pregame host Howard Cosell and color commentators Leo Durocher, Tommy Henrich, Warren Spahn (who worked with Chris Schenkel on a July 17, Baltimore-Detroit contest), and Hall of Fame Brooklyn Dodger great Jackie Robinson (who, on April 17, 1965, became the first black network broadcaster for Major League Baseball). According to ABC Sports producer Chuck Howard, \"(Robinson) had a high, stabbing voice, great presence, and sharp mind. All he lacked was time.\"\nThe announcing duos were generally, Chris Schenkel-Leo Durocher and Merle Harmon-Jackie Robinson. For instance, the team of Schenkel and Durocher called the San Francisco-New York Mets contest on April 17, Milwaukee-Pittsburgh contest on August 21, and the San Francisco-Los Angeles (alongside Jackie Robinson) on September 6. The San Francisco-Los Angeles game on Labor Day was the first meeting between those two clubs since a melee from about two weeks prior involving Giants pitcher Juan Marichal cracking Dodgers catcher John Roseboro on the head during a brawl. Jackie Robinson worked with Merle Harmon on at least, the St. Louis-Cincinnati contest on April 24.\nIt was around this time that ABC suggested that Major League Baseball reduce their regular season schedule to just 60 games. ABC wanted the games to only be played on weekends. They also wanted to promote baseball in the same manner as football, as a major television event.\n1970s.\nIn March 1975, Commissioner Bowie Kuhn announced that ABC would join NBC in a new deal with Major League Baseball. The rights fees paid by the two networks were 29.3% higher than what MLB got in the 1971 deal, but adjusted for inflation, the money in the new deal was about the same as in the old one. Under the initial agreement (1976–1979), both networks paid $92.8 million.\nABC paid $12.5 million per year to show 16 Monday night games in 1976, 18 in the next three years, plus half the postseason (both League Championship Series in even numbered years and World Series in odd numbered years) and the All-Star Game in even numbered years. NBC paid $10.7 million per year to show 25 Saturday \"Games of the Week\" and the other half of the postseason (both League Championship Series in odd numbered years and World Series in even numbered years) and the All-Star Game in odd numbered years.\n1976–1977.\nABC also picked up the television rights for \"Monday Night Baseball\" beginning in 1976. For most of its time on ABC, the Monday night games were held on \"dead travel days\" when few games were scheduled. The team owners liked that arrangement as the national telecasts didn't compete against their stadium box offices. ABC on the other hand, found the arrangement far more complicated. ABC often had only one or two games to pick from for each telecast from a schedule designed by Major League Baseball. While trying to give all of the teams national exposure, ABC ended up with far too many games between sub .500 clubs from small markets. Reviewing the network's first two weeks of coverage for \"Sports Illustrated\", William Leggett opined: \"It may be unfair to say that \"Monday Night Baseball\", as it has been presented by ABC so far this season, is the worst television treatment ever given a major sport, because by all odds somebody at sometime must have done something worse. But it is difficult to remember when or where that might have happened.\"\nOn the flip side however, ABC Sports head Roone Arledge brought in then innovative concept of a center field camera. This camera is behind the pitcher that looks at the batter's face. ABC Sports had to gain special permission from both Major League Baseball and the home team to put the camera in center field.\nJust like with \"Monday Night Football\", ABC brought in the concept of the three-man-booth (originally with Bob Prince, Bob Uecker, and Warner Wolf as the primary crew) to their baseball telecasts. Al Michaels, then the radio announcer for the San Francisco Giants, was brought in by ABC as the back-up announcer for \"Monday Night Baseball\". That year, Michaels called two no-hitters: by the Pirates' John Candelaria vs. Los Angeles on August 9 (for ABC) and the Giants' John Montefusco at Atlanta on September 29, 1976 (for Giants radio). Michaels initially worked in the booth alongside Bob Gibson and Norm Cash. The following year, Cash would be replaced by Bill White, who himself, would remain with ABC through the 1979 season. All in all, the back-up telecasts were made available to an estimated 15% of the United States.\nRoone Arledge stated that \"It'll take something different for it to work – i.e. curb viewership yawns and lulls with Uecker as the real difference\", so Arledge reportedly hoped. Prince disclosed to his broadcasting partner Jim Woods about his early worries about calling a network series for the first time. Prince for one, didn't have as much creative control over the broadcasts on ABC as he did calling Pittsburgh Pirates games on KDKA radio. On the June 7, 1976, edition of \"Monday Night Baseball\", Prince returned to Three Rivers Stadium, from which he had been exiled for over a year. Although Prince received a warm reception, he was confused when the next day the \"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\" read: \"Ratings are low, negative reviews rampant.\" Critics ripped ABC's coverage for such things as its camera work (they often followed fly balls like they did golf shots, keeping the focus on the ball) and its choice of announcers: Bob Prince was accused of a National League bias, while Bob Uecker was considered to be just a Don Meredith clone.\nOn June 28, 1976, the Detroit Tigers faced the New York Yankees on \"Monday Night Baseball\", with 47,855 attending at Tiger Stadium and a national television audience, Tigers pitcher Mark \"The Bird\" Fidrych talked to the ball and groomed the mound, as the Tigers won, 5–1 in a game that lasted only 1 hour and 51 minutes. After the game, the crowd would not leave the park until Fidrych came out of the dugout to tip his cap.\nFor ABC's coverage of the 1976 All-Star Game from Philadelphia, the team of Bob Prince, Bob Uecker and Warner Wolf alternated roles for the broadcast. For the first three innings, Prince did play-by-play with Wolf on color commentary and Uecker doing field interviews. For the middle innings, Uecker worked play-by-play with Prince on color and Wolf doing the interviews. For the rest of the game, Wolf worked play-by-play with Uecker on color and Prince doing interviews.\nBob Prince was gone by the fall of 1976, with Keith Jackson, Howard Cosell, and guest analyst Reggie Jackson calling that year's American League Championship Series. (Warner Wolf, Al Michaels and guest analyst Tom Seaver worked the NLCS.) On the subject of his dismissal from ABC, Bob Prince said \"I hated Houston, and ABC never let me be Bob Prince.\" MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn strongly objected to ABC's recruitment of Howard Cosell because of comments by Cosell in recent years about how dull baseball had become. But Roone Arledge held the trump card as the contract he had signed with Major League Baseball gave ABC the final say over announcers. So Cosell worked the 1976 ALCS and became a regular member of \"Monday Night Baseball\" the next season.\nKeith Jackson was unavailable to call Game 1 of the 1976 ALCS because he had just gotten finished calling an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC. Thus, Bob Uecker filled-in for Jackson for Game 1. Uecker also took part in the postgame interviews for Game 5 of the 1976 ALCS, while Warner Wolf did an interview of George Brett in the Kansas City locker room.\nStill on the disabled list toward the end of the 1977 season, Mark Fidrych worked as a guest color analyst on a \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecast for ABC; he was subsequently criticized for his lack of preparation, as when play-by-play partner Al Michaels tried talking with him about Philadelphia Phillies player Richie Hebner and Fidrych responded, \"Who's Richie Hebner?\" As an American League player, Fidrych had never had to face Hebner, who played in the National League.\nThe 1977 World Series marked the first time that the participating teams' local announcers were not used as the booth announcers on the network telecast of a World Series. 1977 was also the first year in which one announcer (in this case, ABC's Keith Jackson) provided all of the play-by-play for a World Series telecast. In previous years, the play-by-play announcers and color commentators had alternated roles during each game. Meanwhile, New York Yankees announcer Bill White and Los Angeles Dodgers announcer Ross Porter alternated between pregame/postgame duties on ABC and calling the games for CBS Radio. White worked the ABC telecasts for the games in New York (including the clubhouse trophy presentation ceremony after Game 6) while Porter did likewise for the games in Los Angeles.\n\"The Bronx is Burning\".\nHoward Cosell was widely attributed with saying the famous phrase \"The Bronx is burning\". Cosell is credited with saying the quote during Game 2 of the 1977 World Series, which took place in Yankee Stadium on October 12, 1977. For a couple of years, fires had routinely erupted in the South Bronx, mostly due to low-value property owners setting their own properties ablaze for insurance money. During the bottom of the first inning, an ABC aerial camera panned a few blocks from Yankee Stadium to a building on fire, giving the world a real-life view of the infamous Bronx fires. The scene became a defining image of New York City in the 1970s. Cosell supposedly stated, \"There it is, ladies and gentlemen, The Bronx is burning.\" This was later picked up by candidate Ronald Reagan, who then made a special trip to the Bronx, to illustrate the failures of then-contemporary politicians to address the issues in that part of New York City.\nIn 2005, author Jonathan Mahler published \"Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx is Burning\", a book on New York in 1977, and credited Cosell with saying the title quote during the aerial coverage of the fire. ESPN produced a 2007 mini-series based on the book called \"The Bronx is Burning\". Cosell's comment seemed to have captured the widespread view held at the time that New York City was on the skids and in a state of decline.\nThe truth was discovered after Major League Baseball published a complete DVD set of all of the games of the 1977 World Series. Coverage of the fire begins with Keith Jackson commenting on the enormity of the blaze, while Cosell added that President Carter had visited that area just days before. As the top of the second inning began, the fire was once again shown from a helicopter-mounted camera, and Cosell commented that the New York Fire Department had a hard job to do in the Bronx as there were always numerous fires. In the bottom of the second, Cosell informed the audience that it was an abandoned building that was burning and no lives were in danger. There was no further comment on the fire, and Cosell appears to have never said \"The Bronx is Burning\" (at least not on camera) during Game 2.\n1978–1979.\nIn 1978, Baseball Hall of Famer Don Drysdale joined ABC Sports with assignments such as \"Monday Night Baseball\", \"Superstars\", and \"Wide World of Sports\". In , Drysdale covered the World Series Trophy presentation. According to Drysdale \"My thing is to talk about inside things. Keith [Jackson] does play-by-play. Howard's [Cosell] role is anything since anything can happen in broadcasting.\" When ABC released and then rehired him in 1981, Drysdale explained it by saying \"If there is nothing to say, be quiet.\" Ultimately, Drysdale seemed to be slowly phased out of the ABC picture as fellow pitcher Jim Palmer was considered ABC's new poster child \"[of] superior looks and...popularity from underwear commercials.\" By 1989, Palmer would earn $350,000 from ABC for appearing on around ten regular season broadcasts and making a few postseason appearances.\nFor a national television audience, the 1978 American League East tie-breaker game (New York Yankees/Boston Red Sox) aired on ABC with Keith Jackson and Don Drysdale on the call. Meanwhile, the game aired locally in New York City on WPIX and WSBK-TV in Boston with local announcers. Also in 1978, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC and then, flew to New York, arriving just in time to call Game 4 of the ALCS that same night (October 7).\nIn 1979, the start of ABC's \"Monday Night Baseball\" coverage was moved back to June, due to poor ratings during the May sweeps period. In place of April and May prime time games, ABC began airing \"Sunday Afternoon Baseball\" games in September. The network also aired one Friday night game (the Yankees at the Angels) on July 13 of that year. On August 6, 1979, the entire Yankee team attended team captain/catcher Thurman Munson's funeral in Canton, Ohio. Teammates Lou Piniella and Bobby Murcer, who were Munson's best friends, gave eulogies. That night (before a national viewing audience on ABC's \"Monday Night Baseball\") the Yankees beat the Baltimore Orioles 5–4 in New York, with Murcer driving in all five runs with a three-run home run in the seventh inning and a two-run single in the bottom of the ninth.\nFor the 1979 World Series, ABC used play-by-play announcers Keith Jackson (in Baltimore) and Al Michaels (in Pittsburgh), and color commentators Howard Cosell and Don Drysdale. ABC's broadcast was also simulcast over the Orioles' and Pirates' respective local television outlets, CBS affiliates WMAR-TV in Baltimore and KDKA-TV in Pittsburgh, in addition to ABC's own affiliates WJZ-TV and WTAE-TV. After the sixth game, Howard Cosell in his limo was surrounded and attacked by angry Oriole fans with shaving cream, which prompted Baltimore police to complement his private security for Game 7.\n1980s.\nABC hardly showed many baseball games during the regular season in the 1980s. And when they did, it was only on either Monday or Thursday nights from the end of Sweeps Week in late May until when the NFL Preseason started in the first week of August. After that, they typically would not broadcast baseball again until the playoffs. ABC also had a clause where they could air a game the last day of the regular season if it had playoff implications, such as in 1987 in regards to the Detroit Tigers' American League East pennant chase against the Toronto Blue Jays. The team of Al Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver called that game nationally. However, in 1986, ABC did do a number of early season Sunday afternoon games before they went into \"Monday Night Baseball\".\n1980–1982.\nABC's contract was further modified prior to the 1980 season, with the network airing just five \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecasts in June of that year, followed by \"Sunday Afternoon Baseball\" in August and September. ABC did Sunday afternoon games late in the season to fulfill the number of games in the contract and to not interfere with \"Monday Night Football\". Also in 1980, ABC (with Al Michaels and Bob Uecker on the call) broadcast the National League West tie-breaker game between the Houston Astros and Los Angeles Dodgers. On October 11, 1980, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC in the afternoon, then flew to Houston to call Game 4 of the NLCS). In the meantime, Don Drysdale did the play-by-play for the early innings (up until the middle of the fourth inning). Meanwhile, ABC used Steve Zabriskie as a field reporter during the 1980 NLCS.\nIn 1981, ABC planned to increase coverage to 10 Monday night games and eight Sunday afternoon games, but the players' strike that year ended up reducing the network's schedule to three Monday night and seven Sunday afternoon telecasts. Also in 1981, as means to recoup revenue lost during a players' strike, Major League Baseball set up a special additional playoff round (as a prelude to the League Championship Series). ABC televised the American League Division Series while NBC televised the National League Division Series. The Division Series round wasn't officially instituted until 14 years later. Games 3 of the Brewers/Yankees series and Royals/Athletics series were aired regionally. On October 10, Keith Jackson called an Oklahoma-Texas college football game for ABC and missed Game 4 of the Milwaukee-New York series. In Jackson's absence, Don Drysdale filled-in for him on play-by-play alongside Howard Cosell. On a trivial note the ABC's affiliates, WTEN in Albany, New York and its satellite WCDC-TV in Adams, Massachusetts, as well as WIXT (now WSYR-TV) in Syracuse, New York, did not carry any of ABC's games at that time because of the New York Yankees games that were simulcast from New York City's WPIX, movies, and syndicated series and specials among others to provide advertising for those extra money.\nIn 1982, ABC aired 11 Monday night games and one Sunday afternoon game. Following his retirement, Steve Stone was hired by ABC to serve as a color commentator for their \"Monday Night Baseball\" telecasts. Stone was normally paired with Al Michaels and Bob Uecker in the booth.\nAlso in 1982, Baltimore Orioles manager Earl Weaver announced he would retire at the end of the season, one which saw the Orioles wallow at the back of the pack for the first half of the year before climbing in the standings to just three games behind going into a season-ending four-game series against the division-leading Milwaukee Brewers at Baltimore's Memorial Stadium. The Orioles beat them handily in the first three games to pull into a first-place tie. The final game of the series, and the season, on October 3, would decide the AL East title. Televised nationally on a Sunday afternoon on ABC (with Keith Jackson and Howard Cosell on the call), the Orioles suffered a crushing 10–2 loss. After the game, the crowd called for Weaver to come out. This tribute to the retiring Weaver provided intense emotion against the backdrop of the season-ending defeat, as Weaver, in tears, stood on the field and applauded back to the fans, and shared words and an embrace with Brewers manager Harvey Kuenn.\nGame 1 of the 1982 NLCS had to be played twice. In the first attempt (on October 6), the Atlanta Braves led against the St. Louis Cardinals 1–0 behind Phil Niekro. The game was three outs away becoming official when the umpire stopped it. When the rain did not subside, the game was canceled. Game 1 began from the start the following night in a pitching match-up of Pascual Pérez for the Braves and longtime Cardinal starter Bob Forsch. Howard Cosell did not broadcast Game 2 of the 1982 NLCS (alongside Al Michaels and Tommy Lasorda) because of his commitment of hosting the Pittsburgh Steelers' 50th Anniversary dinner in Pittsburgh on October 9, 1982, which was broadcast live on Pittsburgh's ABC affiliate, WTAE-TV and Pittsburgh's NBC affiliate, WPXI-TV. ABC's Jim Lampley interviewed the winners in the Cardinals' clubhouse after clinching the National League pennant in Game 3.\nThe ABC's coverage of 1982 American League Championship Series between the Milwaukee Brewers and California Angels, featured the broadcast team of Keith Jackson, Jim Palmer, and Earl Weaver. In his final assignment as a member of ABC's baseball broadcasting team, Bob Uecker interviewed the victorious members of the Brewers from their clubhouse following Game 5. Meanwhile, Ted Dawson interviewed 1982 ALCS Most Valuable Player Fred Lynn (the first player from the losing side to be awarded the MVP Award for a League Championship Series), Bobby Grich, and manager Gene Mauch from the Angels' clubhouse after Game 5. Following the 1982 ALCS, Keith Jackson wouldn't be assigned to broadcast further Major League Baseball games for ABC until the 1986 season.\n1983–1989 television package.\nOn April 7, 1983, Major League Baseball, ABC, and NBC agreed to terms of a six-year television package worth $1.2 billion. The two networks continued to alternate coverage of the playoffs (ABC in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years), World Series (ABC televised the World Series in odd numbered years and NBC in even numbered years), and All-Star Game (ABC televised the All-Star Game in even numbered years and NBC in odd numbered years) through the 1989 season, with each of the 26 clubs receiving $7 million per year in return. The last package gave each club $1.9 million per year. ABC contributed $575 million for regular season prime time and Sunday afternoons and NBC paid $550 million for thirty Saturday afternoon games. ABC was contracted to televise 20 prime time regular season games a year in addition to other games (the aforementioned Sunday afternoon games). But ABC didn't come close to using that many, which meant they actually paid for games they weren't showing. To give you some perspective, ABC televised six prime time games in 1984 and eight 1985. They planned to again televise eight prime time games in 1986.\nUSA Network's coverage became a casualty of the new $1.2 billion TV contract between Major League Baseball, ABC and NBC. One of the provisions to the new deal was that local telecasts opposite network games had to be eliminated.\n1983 marked the last time that local telecasts of League Championship Series games were allowed. In 1982, Major League Baseball recognized a problem with this due to the emergence of cable superstations such as WTBS in Atlanta and WGN-TV in Chicago. When TBS tried to petition for the right to do a \"local\" Braves broadcast of the 1982 NLCS, Major League Baseball got a Philadelphia federal court to ban them on the grounds that as a cable superstation, TBS couldn't have a nationwide telecast competing with ABC's.\nOn June 6, 1983, Al Michaels officially succeeded Keith Jackson as the lead play-by-play announcer for \"Monday Night Baseball\". Michaels, who spent seven seasons working backup games, was apparently very miffed over ABC Sports' delay in announcing him as their top baseball announcer. Unlike Jackson, whose forte was college football, Michaels had gigs with the Cincinnati Reds and San Francisco Giants before joining ABC in 1976. \"TV Guide\" huffed about Jackson by saying \"A football guy, on baseball!\" Jackson was unavailable for several World Series games in and because of conflicts with his otherwise normal college football broadcasting schedule. Thus, Michaels did play-by-play for games on weekends.\nEarl Weaver was the lead ABC color commentator in 1983, but was also employed by the Baltimore Orioles as a consultant. At the time, ABC had a policy preventing an announcer who was employed by a team from working games involving that team. So whenever the Orioles were on the primary ABC game, Weaver worked the backup game. This policy forced Weaver to resign from the Orioles' consulting position in October so that he could work the World Series for ABC.\nThe 1984 NLCS schedule (which had an off day after Game 3 rather than Game 2) allowed ABC to have a prime time game each weeknight even though Chicago's Wrigley Field did not have lights at the time (which remained the case until four years later). ABC used Tim McCarver as a field reporter during the 1984 NLCS. During the regular season, McCarver teamed with Don Drysdale (who teamed with Earl Weaver and Reggie Jackson for the 1984 NLCS) on backup games while Al Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Earl Weaver/Howard Cosell formed ABC's lead broadcast team. For ABC's coverage of the 1984 All-Star Game, Jim Palmer only served as a between innings analyst.\nHad the 1984 ALCS between the Detroit Tigers and Kansas City Royals gone the full five games (the last year that the League Championship Series was a best-of-five series), Game 5 on Sunday October 7, would have been a 1 p.m. ET time start instead of being in prime time. This would have happened because one of the presidential debates between Ronald Reagan and Walter Mondale was scheduled for that night. In return, ABC was going to broadcast the debates instead of a baseball game in prime time. Al Trautwig interviewed the Detroit Tigers from their clubhouse following their pennant clinching victory in Game 3.\nBetween his stints with the California Angels and Oakland Athletics in 1985, Tommy John served as color commentator alongside Tim McCarver for a game between the Chicago White Sox and the Athletics in Oakland on \"Monday Night Baseball\" on June 24. McCarver's normal broadcast partner in 1985, Don Drysdale couldn't partake in the June 24 broadcast out of fear of it appearing as a \"conflict of interest\". Drysdale in addition to his ABC duties, was an announcer for the White Sox at the time. This situation was similar to the one with Earl Weaver being prohibited from taking part in ABC's broadcasts of Baltimore Orioles games in 1983.\nIn 1985, ABC announced that every game of the World Series would be played under the lights for the biggest baseball audience possible. Just prior to the start of the 1985 World Series, ABC removed Howard Cosell from scheduled announcing duties as punishment for his controversial book \"I Never Played the Game\". In Cosell's place came Tim McCarver (joining play-by-play man Michaels and fellow color commentator Jim Palmer), who was beginning his trek of being a part of numerous World Series telecasts. Reportedly, by 1985, Cosell was considered to be difficult to work with on baseball telecasts. Apparently, Cosell and Michaels got into a fairly heated argument following the conclusion of their coverage of the 1984 American League Championship Series due to Cosell's supposed drunkenness among other problems. Rumor has it that Michaels went as far as to urged ABC executives to remove Cosell from the booth. Ultimately, Michaels went public with his problems with Cosell. Michaels claimed that \"Howard had become a cruel, evil, vicious person.\"\nIn the end, the very last baseball game that Howard Cosell would help broadcast for ABC and his very last assignment for ABC Sports in general, was a game between the between the Kansas City Royals and Minnesota Twins in Minneapolis on Sunday, September 29, 1985.\nPerhaps Al Michaels's first historic call with ABC Sports while covering Major League Baseball occurred in what is now known by many as the Don Denkinger game on October 26, 1985. The Kansas City Royals trailed the St. Louis Cardinals 3–1 in a World Series that was panned for being low-scoring and dull. After a Royals win in St. Louis forced the action back to Kansas City, the sixth game was also low scoring. However, this contest grew into a tense pitcher's duel.\nIn the bottom of the 9th, pinch-hitter Jorge Orta led off for the Royals against Cardinals pitcher Todd Worrell with Kansas City trailing 1–0 and hit a ground ball to first baseman Jack Clark. Clark threw over to pitcher Worrell, who was running over to cover first base in time to beat the speedy Orta and did. Yet first base umpire Don Denkinger still called Orta safe at first. Steve Balboni then hit a pop-up to first which Jack Clark missed for an error, keeping Balboni's at-bat alive, and he promptly singled to put men on first and second.\nThe infamous and controversial leadoff single by Orta and the Jack Clark error eventually led to the Royals loading the bases and putting the tying run on third base and the winning run on second with one out for Dane Iorg. Iorg hit a 2-run single and the Royals came back to win 2–1. The Royals went on to win Game 7 11–0 and complete the comeback after being down 3 games to 1. However, it was Denkinger's dubious 'safe' call, and not Iorg's hit, Clark's error, Jim Sundberg's heroics (for his difficult slide past catcher Darrell Porter for the winning run) or the Game 7 blowout that were most remembered in years to come.\n1986–1988.\nBy 1986, ABC only televised 13 \"Monday Night Baseball\" games. This was a fairly sharp contrast to the 18 games to that were scheduled in 1978. \"The Sporting News\" believed that ABC paid Major League Baseball to not make them televise the regular season. No late season games in September were scheduled in 1986. \"TSN\" added that the network only wanted the sport for October anyway. Going into 1987, ABC had reportedly purchased 20 Monday night games but only used eight of those slots. More to the point, CBS Sports president Neal Pilson said \"Three years ago, we believed ABC's package was overpriced by $175 million. We still believe it's overpriced by $175 million.\"\nDuring the 1986 season, Don Drysdale did play-by-play ABC's Sunday afternoon games, which aired until July, when \"Monday Night Baseball\" began. ABC's Monday night schedule in 1986, then started on July 7 and ran through August 25. Al Michaels did the main Sunday game usually with Jim Palmer, while Drysdale and Johnny Bench did the backup contests. Keith Jackson, working with Tim McCarver, did the secondary Monday night games. Bench took a week off in June (with Steve Busby filling in) and also worked one game with Michaels as the networks switched the announcer pairings. While Drysdale worked the All-Star Game in Houston as an interviewer, he did not resurface until the playoffs. Bench simply disappeared, ultimately going to CBS Radio.\nOn October 12, 1986, at Anaheim Stadium, Al Michaels along with Jim Palmer called Game 5 of the American League Championship Series. The California Angels held a 3 games to 1 lead of a best-of-seven against the Boston Red Sox. In the game, the Angels held a 5–2 lead going into the ninth inning. Boston scored two runs on a home run by Don Baylor, closing the gap to 5–4.\nWhen Donnie Moore came in to shut down the rally, there were two outs, and a runner on first base, Rich Gedman, who had been hit by a pitch. The Angels were one out from their first-ever trip to the World Series. But Dave Henderson hit a 2–2 pitch off Moore for a home run, giving the Red Sox a 6–5 lead. The Angels were able to score a run in the bottom of the ninth, pushing the game into extra innings. Moore continued to pitch for the Angels. He was able to stifle a 10th inning Red Sox rally by getting Jim Rice to ground into a double play. Nevertheless, the Red Sox were able to score off Moore in the 11th-inning via a sacrifice fly by Henderson. The Angels could not score in the bottom of the 11th and lost the game 7–6.\nThe defeat still left the Angels in a 3–2 advantage, with two more games to play at Fenway Park. The Angels were not able to recover, losing both games by wide margins, 10–4 and 8–1. Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS ended with Calvin Schiraldi striking out Jerry Narron.\nOn October 15, 1986, Game 6 of the NLCS ran so long (lasting for 16 innings, 5 hours and 29 minutes), it bumped up against the start time of Game 7 of the ALCS (also on ABC). That same game, color commentator Tim McCarver left the booth during the bottom of the 16th, to cover the expected celebration in the New York Mets' clubhouse. As a result, play-by-play man Keith Jackson was on the air alone for a short time. Eventually, McCarver rejoined the broadcast just before the end of the game, watching the action on a monitor in the Mets' clubhouse, then doing the postgame interviews with the Mets. Meanwhile, Corey McPherrin, a sports anchor with WABC (ABC's flagship station out of New York City) interviewed Mike Scott when he was presented with the 1986 NLCS MVP award after Game 6. During the late 1980s, McPherrin delivered in-game updates during ABC's \"Monday Night Baseball\" and \"Thursday Night Baseball\" broadcasts.\nGame 6 of the 1986 NLCS turned out to be the final Major League Baseball game that Keith Jackson would broadcast. Meanwhile, in his last ever ABC assignment, Don Drysdale interviewed the winners in the Boston clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1986 ALCS.\nFor the 1987 World Series between the Minnesota Twins and St. Louis Cardinals, ABC used 12 cameras and nine tape machines. This includes cameras positioned down the left field line, on the roof of the Metrodome, and high above third base. There have been a few occasions when two \"Monday Night Football\" games were played simultaneously. In 1987, a scheduling conflict arose when Major League Baseball's Minnesota Twins went to Game 7 of the World Series, making the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome unavailable for the Minnesota Vikings' scheduled game (against the Denver Broncos) that Sunday. Game 6 of the 1987 World Series (played on Saturday, October 24) was the last World Series game to not be played in prime time. The game started at 4 p.m. Eastern Time. Another weekend afternoon sixth game was planned for , however, since the World Series ended in five games, it was unnecessary.\nThe 1987 World Series was the final one that ABC aired that went the full seven games. The next time that ABC broadcast a World Series in 1989, the Oakland Athletics swept the San Francisco Giants in four games. For the final World Series that ABC broadcast to date, 1995, they split the coverage with NBC. ABC only covered Games 1, 4–5 and a seventh game had it been necessary. ABC overall, drew a 24.0 rating for their coverage of the 1987 World Series.\nIn a February 2015 interview, Al Michaels alleged the Twins pumped artificial crowd noise into the Metrodome during the 1987 World Series. Responding to Michaels' theory, Twins President Dave St. Peter said that he did not think the Twins needed \"conspiracy theories\" in order to win the World Series. Instead, he argued that \"appreciation and respect\" should be paid to players like Frank Viola, Gary Gaetti, Kent Hrbek, and Kirby Puckett, who, he said, \"came out of nowhere to win a championship.\"\nDuring the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, networks benefited from sports programming, including NBC, which relied on the Summer Olympics in September and the World Series in October, and ABC, which in addition to its postseason baseball coverage, moved up the start time for the early weeks of \"Monday Night Football\" (when Al Michaels was unavailable to do play-by-play on \"Monday Night Football\", which he had done for ABC beginning in 1986 due to his postseason baseball duties, Frank Gifford covered for him) from 9 p.m. ET to 8 p.m. ET (\"MacGyver\", which normally aired at 8 pm, was not yet ready with new episodes).\nCome the 1988 League Championship Series, ABC under the guidance of new executive producer Geoffrey Mason, debuted fatter and wider graphics that gave off a cleaner, sharper look complete with a black border. ABC also debuted a new energetic, symphonic-pop styled musical theme, composed by Kurt Bestor, which would become an all-compassing theme of sorts for ABC Sports during this time period. ABC also begun employing the services of Pinnacle Productions Inc., a video-production company based out of Spokane, Washington, to create the opening title sequences for their sports telecasts.\nABC's coverage of Game 2 of the 1988 NLCS didn't start until 10 pm. ET due to a presidential debate. This is the latest ever scheduled start for an LCS game.\nGary Bender did play-by-play for the 1988 American League Championship Series between the Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox. Bender spent two years (1987–1988) as the No. 2 baseball play-by-play man for ABC behind Al Michaels. Bender worked the backup \"Monday Night Baseball\" broadcasts (with Tim McCarver in 1987 and Joe Morgan in 1988) as well as serving as a field reporter for ABC's 1987 World Series coverage. After Bender spent an entire summer developing a team with Joe Morgan, ABC brought in Reggie Jackson to work with the duo for the 1988 ALCS. According to Bender's autobiography \"Call of the Game\" (pages 118–120), ABC's decision to bring in Jackson to work with Bender and Morgan caused problems: \nDuring the spare time of his active career, Reggie Jackson worked as a field reporter and color commentator for ABC Sports. During the 1980s (1983, 1985, and 1987 respectively), Jackson was given the task of presiding over the World Series Trophy presentations.\nAfter wrapping up his play-by-play duties for ABC's coverage of the 1988 ALCS, in which Oakland swept Boston in four games, Gary Bender covered the postgame interviews in the victorious Los Angeles Dodgers' clubhouse following Game 7 of the 1988 NLCS against the New York Mets. Three days earlier, Mike Barry interviewed Boston manager Joe Morgan following their defeat to Oakland in Game 4 of the ALCS.\n1989.\nOn December 14, 1988, CBS (under the guidance of Commissioner Peter Ueberroth, Major League Baseball's broadcast director Bryan Burns, CBS Inc. CEO Laurence Tisch as well as CBS Sports executives Neal Pilson and Eddie Einhorn) paid approximately US$1.8 billion (equivalent to billion in ) for exclusive over-the-air television rights for over four years (beginning in 1990). CBS paid about $265 million each year for the World Series, League Championship Series, All-Star Game, and the Saturday \"Game of the Week\". It was one of the largest agreements (to date) between the sport of baseball and the business of broadcasting. The cost of the deal between CBS and Major League Baseball was about 25% more than in the previous television contract with ABC and NBC.\nAccording to industry insiders, neither NBC nor ABC wanted the entire baseball package—that is, regular-season games, both League Championship Series and the World Series—because such a commitment would have required them to preempt too many highly rated prime time shows. Thus, ABC and NBC bid thinking that two of the networks might share postseason play again or that one of the championship series might wind up on cable. Peter Ueberroth had encouraged the cable idea, but after the bids were opened, NBC and ABC found to their chagrin that he preferred network exposure for all postseason games. Only CBS, with its weak prime time programming, dared go for that.\nIn 1989 (the final year of ABC's contract with Major League Baseball), ABC moved the baseball telecasts to Thursday nights in hopes of getting leg up against NBC's \"Cosby Show\". Scott Muni, a disc jockey, who worked at the heyday of the AM Top 40 format and then was a pioneer of FM progressive rock radio, voiced promos for ABC's \"Thursday Night Baseball\" broadcasts. ABC was also still in-line to air a special Sunday afternoon telecast on October 1 in the event that the American League East race between the Toronto Blue Jays and Baltimore Orioles still hadn't been decided. But since the Blue Jays managed to clinch the divisional title the day prior, it wasn't necessary.\nAfter braving the traumatic Loma Prieta earthquake and an all-time low 16.4 rating for the 1989 World Series, Al Michaels took ABC's loss of baseball to CBS as \"tough to accept.\" Michaels added that \"baseball was such an early stepchild at ABC and had come such a long way.\" Gary Thorne, who served as ABC's backup play-by-play announcer in 1989 and was an on-field reporter for the World Series that year (and covered the trophy presentation in the process), simply laughed while saying \"Great reviews, just as ABC baseball ends.\" Meanwhile, Dennis Swanson, president of ABC Sports, noted in a statement that baseball had been \"a blue-chip franchise\" since 1976 for the network, which was \"disappointed\" to lose it. After ABC lost the Major League Baseball package to CBS, they aggressively counterprogrammed CBS' postseason baseball coverage (like NBC) with made-for-TV movies and miniseries geared towards female viewers.\nAccording to ABC broadcast engineer Dan Rapak in the book \"Brought to You by . . .\", ABC's coverage of the 1989 World Series was about to become a case study in financial stupidity. By this point in time, ABC Sports was well into cost-cutting mode and trying to avoid unnecessarily expenditure. ABC decided that to save money, there would be no satellite uplink trunk present at San Francisco's Candlestick Park. Instead, the feed from San Francisco back to ABC's headquarters in New York City would take a complex, circuitous route. For starters, the signal would go from the truck to a telephone company room (dubbed a \"clamper room\") at the third level of the stadium. From there, the signal would be transmitted over a fiber optic cable onto the local phone company switching office. From there, the signal would be sent to KGO, ABC's owned-and-operated station in the San Francisco Bay Area. The signal would then pass through KGO's Master Control Room and soon uplinked to a satellite which relayed the signal to a downlink in Connecticut. Finally, the signal would be sent to the ABC Television Complex in New York.\nRapak added that to save further costs, ABC decided that an on-site telephone company technician wasn't really necessary. As such, ABC wouldn't pay to have him on site just in case any problems might have arise with the phone company's equipment. Not only that, but ABC merely rented a small standby generator to protect them in the event of a power failure. ABC's management decided that it would be too costly to have a large \"transfer switch\" shipped in from ABC Sports' field shop in Lodi, New Jersey. This particular switch would be able to shift the entire load of all the mobile units from local utility power to the generator with a single pull of a large lever. But since ABC's engineers who were working at Candlestick Park during the 1989 World Series had no means of quickly putting the generator into service should the need arise, they would have to instead, kill the utility power sources for safety. They would then have to disconnect more than a dozen huge power cables from the power boxes inside of the stadium. Next, they would have to physically drag the power cables outside of the stadium and reconnect all of them to turn the generator on. This in effect, meant that the changeover would've taken approximately 10 minutes, when it could've simply taken less than a minute.\nPrior to the start of the 1990 season, speculation arose that Al Michaels would move over to CBS in the event that he won an arbitration case against ABC. Tim McCarver had already been hired by CBS to serve as their lead color commentator and they were in need of a play-by-play man following the abrupt dismissal of Brent Musburger on April Fools' Day 1990. Michaels had been feuding with the network over an alleged violation of company policy. Michaels' contract with ABC was originally set to expire in late 1992. Ultimately however, ABC announced a contract extension that sources said would keep Michaels at ABC through at least the end of 1995 and would pay him at least $2.2 million annually with the potential to earn more. That would make Michaels the highest-paid sports announcer in television. Meanwhile, CBS eventually settled on using the services of Jack Buck for their top play-by-play man.\nLoma Prieta earthquake.\nGame 3 of the 1989 World Series (initially scheduled for October 17) was delayed by ten days due to the Loma Prieta earthquake. The earthquake struck at approximately 5:04 p.m. Pacific Time. At the moment the quake struck, ABC's color commentator Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of the previous Series game. Viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver's colleague Al Michaels exclaim, \"I'll tell you what, we're having an earth—.\" At that moment, the feed from Candlestick Park was lost. The network put up a green ABC Sports telop graphic as the audio was switched to a telephone link. Michaels had to pick up a POTS phone in the press booth (phones work off a separate power supply) and call ABC headquarters in New York, at which point they put him back on the air. Michaels cracked, \"Well folks, that's the greatest open in the history of television, bar none!\" accompanied by the excited screams of fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere.\nAfter about a 15-minute delay (ABC aired a rerun of \"Roseanne\" and subsequently, \"The Wonder Years\" in the meantime), ABC was able to regain power via a backup generator. ABC's play-by-play man, Al Michaels (who was familiar with the San Francisco Bay Area dating back to his days working for the San Francisco Giants from 1974–1976) then proceeded to relay reports to Ted Koppel at ABC News' headquarters in Washington, D.C. Al Michaels was ultimately nominated for an Emmy for his on-site reporting at the World Series.\nThe Goodyear Blimp was aloft above the ballpark to provide aerial coverage of the World Series. Blimp pilot John Crayton reported that he felt four bumps during the quake. ABC was able to use the blimp to capture some of the first images of the damage to the Bay Bridge.\n1990s.\nAfter a four-year-long hiatus (when CBS exclusively carried the over-the-air Major League Baseball television rights, as previously mentioned), ABC returned to baseball in (again, alongside NBC) 1994.\nUnder a six-year plan, Major League Baseball was intended to receive 85% of the first $140 million in advertising in advertising revenue (or 87.5% of advertising revenues and corporate sponsorship from the games until sales top a specified level), 50% of the next $30 million, and 80% of any additional money. Prior to this, Major League Baseball was projected to take a projected 55% cut in rights fees and receive a typical rights fee from the networks.\nAfter NBC's coverage of 1994 All-Star Game was completed, ABC would air regular season games on Saturdays or Mondays for the next six-weeks. Joining the lead broadcast team of Al Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver was \"Lesley Visser\", who served as the lead field reporter for the CBS' baseball coverage from 1990 to 1993. Visser was reuniting with McCarver, for whom she had worked with on CBS. The regular season games fell under the \"Baseball Night in America\" umbrella which premiered on July 16, 1994. On the subject of play-by-play man Al Michaels returning to baseball for the first time since the 1989 World Series, Jim Palmer said \"Here Al is, having done five games since and steps right in. It's hard to comprehend how one guy could so amaze.\" Meanwhile, Brent Musburger, CBS alumnus Jim Kaat, and reporter Jack Arute became the secondary team for ABC. Musburger and Kaat called the rest of the 1995 American League Division Series between the Seattle Mariners and New York Yankees and the first two games of that year's American League Championship Series between Seattle and the Cleveland Indians.\nIn even-numbered years, NBC had the rights to the All-Star Game and both League Championship Series while ABC had the World Series and newly created Division Series. In odd-numbered years, both League Championship Series and All-Star Game television rights were supposed to alternate. As such, ABC would ultimately broadcast the 1995 All-Star Game from The Ballpark in Arlington in Arlington, Texas. It was ABC's first broadcast of the All-Star Game since the 1988 contest in Cincinnati. On Sunday, July 2, ABC aired a one-hour special hosted by Al Michaels that announced the names of the players who were selected to play in the 1995 All-Star Game.\nABC won the rights to the first dibs at the World Series in August 1993 after ABC Sports president Dennis Swanson won a coin toss by calling \"heads.\" Ken Schanzer, who was the CEO of The Baseball Network, handled the coin toss. Schanzer agreed to the coin toss by ABC and NBC at the outset as the means of determining the order in which they'd divvy up the playoffs.\nWhile ABC and NBC would provide some production personnel and their own announcers for the games, all of would be coordinated from the office of Ken Schanzer, the chief executive officer of The Baseball Network and former executive vice president for NBC Sports. The graphics, camera placements, and audio quality were intended on looking and sounding about the same on both networks.\nThe long-term plans for The Baseball Network crumbled when the players went on strike on August 12, 1994 (thus forcing the cancellation of the World Series). In July 1995, ABC and NBC, who wound up having to share the duties of televising the 1995 World Series as a way to recoup (with ABC broadcasting Games 1, 4, and 5 and NBC broadcasting Games 2, 3, and 6), announced that they were opting out of their agreement with Major League Baseball. Both networks figured that as the delayed 1995 baseball season opened without a labor agreement, there was no guarantee against another strike. Both networks soon publicly vowed to cut all ties with Major League Baseball for the rest of the 20th century.\nAl Michaels would later write in his 2014 autobiography \"You Can't Make This Up: Miracles, Memories, and the Perfect Marriage of Sports and Television\" that the competition between the two networks could be so juvenile that neither ABC nor NBC wanted to promote each other's telecasts during the 1995 World Series. In the middle of Game 1, Michaels was handed a promo that read \"Join us here on ABC for Game 4 in Cleveland on Wednesday night and for Game 5 if necessary, Thursday.\" Michaels however would soon add \"By the way, if you're wondering about Games 2 and 3, I can't tell you exactly where you can see them, but here's a hint: Last night, Bob Costas, Joe Morgan, and Bob Uecker ([NBC's broadcast crew] were spotted in Underground Atlanta.\" Naturally, Bob Costas soon made a similar reference to ABC's crew (Michaels, Jim Palmer, and Tim McCarver) on NBC.\nABC Sports president Dennis Swanson, in announcing the dissolution of \nThe Baseball Network, said: \nCalling the final out of Game 5 of the 1995 World Series, Al Michaels yelled, \"Back to Georgia!\" as the Cleveland Indians took it; NBC carried the series-clinching sixth game two days later. As previously mentioned, had that particular World Series gone to a seventh game, then it would've been broadcast by ABC.\nIt was rumored that ABC would only offer Major League Baseball about $10 to $15 million less per year than what CBS was reportedly willing to offer for the 1996 season. At the time, it was reported that Major League Baseball was expecting a combined total of over $900 million in rights fees from two networks.\nUltimately, despite of the failure of The Baseball Network, NBC decided to retain its relationship with Major League Baseball, but on a far more restricted basis. Under the five-year deal signed on November 7, 1995 (running from the 1996 to 2000 seasons) for a total of approximately $400 million, NBC did not televise any regular season games. Instead, NBC only handled the All-Star Game, three Division Series games (on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday nights), and the American League Championship Series in even-numbered years and the World Series, three Division Series games (also on Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday nights) and the National League Championship Series in odd-numbered years. Fox, which assumed ABC's portion of the league broadcast television rights, gained the rights to the Saturday \"Game of the Week\" during the regular season, in addition to alternating rights to the All-Star Game, League Championship Series (the ALCS in odd-numbered years and the NLCS in even-numbered years), Division Series, and the World Series.\nAftermath.\nAfter losing its Major League Baseball broadcast rights again, this time to Fox, ABC counterprogrammed against Fox's postseason coverage by airing a mix of miniseries and TV-movies aimed at female viewers. One of the movies aired on ABC, \"Unforgiven\", aired opposite Andy Pettitte's shutout in Game 5 of the 1996 World Series (Fox's first World Series, and the final game in Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium history).\nWith ABC being sold to The Walt Disney Company in 1996, ESPN picked up daytime and late-evening Division Series games with a provision similar to its National Football League games, in which the games would only air on network affiliates in the local markets of the two participating teams. ESPN's Major League Baseball contract was not affected then, but would take a hit in 1998 with the new National Football League contract.\nIn September 2000, a baseball official, speaking on the condition he not be identified, confirmed ESPN passed on keeping its playoffs rights (thus, giving Fox Sports exclusivity), saying the decision was partly based on price and partly because ABC wasn't interested in the network package.\nABC Family's (now Freeform) coverage of the 2002 Division Series was produced by ESPN. The reason that games were on ABC Family instead of ESPN was because The Walt Disney Company bought Fox Family from News Corporation. The ABC Family/ESPN inherited Division Series package was included in Fox's then exclusive television contract with Major League Baseball (initiated in 2001). ABC Family had no other choice but to fulfill the contract handed to them. The only usage of the ABC Family \"bug\" was for a ten-second period when returning from a commercial break (in the lower right corner of the screen).\n2020s.\nABC would return to airing postseason baseball in 2020. They were scheduled to air at least four of the 24 possible daytime games in the season's first ever expanded eight-series wild card round, that the networks of ESPN will air. Not only did this mean that ABC aired Major League Baseball games of any kind since Game 5 of the 1995 World Series, but it also marked the first time since NBC's final game in 2000, that a Major League Baseball game had aired on any broadcast network other than Fox. It had also been at least 9,105 days since ABC last broadcast a Major League Baseball game.\nOn May 13, 2021, Major League Baseball and The Walt Disney Company announced an extension to ESPN's contract, which included exclusive rights to the Wild Card series, if the league were to expand it. This includes games being broadcast on ABC under a similar structure to the 2020 Wild Card series.\nOn July 7, 2021, ESPN announced that a \"Sunday Night Baseball\" game between the Chicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox, scheduled for August 8 from Wrigley Field would air exclusively on ABC. This was the first regular season Major League Baseball game to be aired on ABC since August 19, 1995, when ABC was part of the short-lived Baseball Network and also the first ESPN-produced regular season telecast that ABC would air.\nOn Saturday, September 24, 2022, and again on Saturday, October 1, 2022, during regularly scheduled college football telecasts, ABC aired live look-ins of the YES Network's telecast of the New York Yankees. This was due to Aaron Judge potentially hitting his 61st and 62nd home run of the season. This was a controversial move, many fans complained about the interruptions. Aaron Judge did not hit his record setting home run during the look-ins.\nIn October 2022, ABC was scheduled to air at least one game from the 2022 Wild Card Series. ABC was also in-line to broadcast a potential third game of the American League Wild Card Series between the Seattle Mariners and Toronto Blue Jays. Ultimately however, Seattle wound up winning the series in two games, thus it wasn't necessary."

        "text": "Edward Joseph Bennett (14 October 1883 – 9 May 1965) was a New Zealand rugby league footballer. Bennett played in the second row position. He represented the New Zealand rugby league team in two test matches against England in 1920. In the process he became the 144th player to represent New Zealand. He also played for the Waiuku rugby club, and the Newton Rangers, and Grafton Athletic rugby league clubs. Bennett also represented the Auckland and North Island rugby league teams.\nEarly life.\nEdward Joseph (Joe) Bennett was born on 14 October 1883, in Waiuku. His parents were George (1840–1914) and Lydia Bennett (née Starke) (1843–1894). He had 7 brothers and 3 sisters: George (1866-1910), Charles James (b. 1867), Charles John (b. 1869), Fanny (1872-1932), Annie (b. 1874), Henry (b. 1876), Frederick (b. 1877), Benjamin (1878-1902), Arthur (b. 1881), and Ellen (b. 1882).\nBoer War.\nBennett enlisted in the Boer War on 5 January 1902, aged 18. He embarked on the Surrey with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, 8th contingent, North Island regiment – C Squadron on 1 February 1902, from Lyttelton. There had been 4,000 applications for the war but only 1,000 were accepted. It was recorded at the time that he weighed 11 st 12lb, and was 5 foot 10. Bennett was a Wesleyan and in the war his rank was of a Private. The war finished on 31 May of the same year and the returning soldiers set sail for New Zealand in July. His occupation at the time as a painter and this was his occupation throughout his life. After returning from the war he was awarded the King's South Africa Medal (South Africa 1902 clasp). In November 1902 Bennett was on board the \"Elingamite\" passenger ship which sank on its way from Sydney to Auckland.\nPlaying career.\nRugby union in Waiuku.\nIn 1903 Bennett was chosen in the Waiuku rugby senior squad at the start of the season. The team only played 6 matches in the season with other competing sides being Pukekohe, Bombay, Wairoa, and Tuakau. Waiuku finished runners up to Pukekohe, with the competition receiving very little coverage in the newspapers.\nThe 1904 season received more coverage. Waiuku held their annual meeting on 23 April. Bennett was awarded the D. Wilson cap for being the best forward in the 1903 season and it was also stated that he was the captain of the side. Bennett played in at least 7 matches, and scored 3 tries, kicked a conversion, and a drop goal for 13 total points. In a preseason match against Suburbs District Club on 30 April, they lost 7–0. Bennett was said to have been one of the \"most conspicuous\" players for Waiuku. The Auckland Star reported that Bennett played wing-forward and \"did good work\". In a match against Wairoa on Mr. Barriball's paddock on 18 June, Bennett scored a second half try in a 12–0 win. Then on 27 July against the same opponent on Mr. McNicol's ground at Clevedon, Bennett scored both of Waiuku's tries in a 6–6 draw. They both came in the first half.\nIt was reported in the \"New Zealand Herald\" on 3 August that as a result of conduct in the match against Pukekohe on 9 July (3 weeks earlier), \"the Waiuku Football Club was disqualified until the end of 1905, and one member of the team for ten years, for misconduct towards the referee in the match, Pukekohe v. Waiuku\". It had been arranged at halftime that the second half should be 35 minutes long but only 25 minutes was played. Waiuku had led at halftime 9–3 but Pukekohe had taken the lead 12–9 when the whistle was blown for full time. \"Remonstration was made, but the whistle had been blown, and the game was over\". It is highly likely that the disqualified player was in fact Bennett as he was captain and it was mentioned at the start of the 1905 season that he was indeed disqualified from the game. He did however play in a friendly match late in the 1904 season against Onehunga in Onehunga. He kicked a drop goal in a 10–6 win. He also played in an end of season match between Married Men and club players. At the start of the 1905 season in a preview of various competitions it was said that \"Bennett, the Waiuku 13st. three-quarter, whose disqualification, the club anticipate, will be removed\". It seems that the disqualification of the Waiuku club was enforced and they did not play a single match in 1905.\nIn 1906 Bennett was again captaining Waiuku as they reinterred the competition. On 19 May they opened their season with a match against Bombay on Mr. Barriball's Paddock. The match ended in a 0–0 draw. He played in further matches against Drury, Pukekohe, Wairoa, Pukekohe, and Tuakau through May and June. Then in another match with Tuakau on 21 July he scored a try in a 6–3 win. He was then chosen in a Franklin Rugby Union trial match for 28 July for the Blue and White team to play the Maroon team. On 25 August Bennett was due to play for Franklin sub union side against an Auckland Secondary Schools Old Boys XV at Pukekohe. However the game was cancelled as the Auckland side was not affiliated to the Auckland Rugby Union and they refused to give permission for the match to take place. Franklin then cancelled their match against the Wednesday Rugby Union later that week. On 8 September Bennett did get to play for Franklin against a combined Ōtāhuhu-Wairoa district team with Bennett in the three-quarters. Franklin was supposed to play another match against the Wednesday Rep side on 12 September, but there was no reporting of the match.\nAt the start of the 1907 season on 6 April Bennett was elected on to the management committee of the Waiuku Football Club. The club also agreed to affiliate with the Auckland Rugby Union. He was also chosen as vice-captain with J. Hone as captain. The Waiuku effectively divided into 3 clubs and formed a tiny sub-union for the 1907 season. Waiuku East became Otaua, Waiuku West became Waipipi, and Central became City. Bennett was part of the City side, and they opened the season with a 0–0 draw against Waipipi. He then played in matches against Ōtāhuhu on 8 June, and then Otaua on 22 June at Waiuku where City were based. He kicked a conversion in a 9–5 loss. Bennett played in two more matches against Waipipi, kicking another conversion in the second of these which City won, 19–3. Otaua won the competition, undefeated through 6 matches. Bennett refereed the final match of the season which secured Otaua the title. Following the match Bennett was selected to play for Waiuku against Ōtāhuhu on 3 August. Waiuku travelled to the match which was played at Onehunga by the launch, Edie. Bennett \"potted a goal, after being thrown to the ground\" and this ultimately turned out to be the winning of the game as Waiuku held on for a 4–3 win. At this time a potted goal was worth 4 points. On 10 August Waiuku played Auckland Juniors with the junior side winning 8–6. Bennett scored a try for Waiuku but missed the conversion, and then near full time Waiuku scored again but Bennett missed the conversion which would have drawn the match. Waiuku played another match against North Shore before a return game against Auckland Juniors at Alexandra Park on 7 September. The Auckland side won 26–0 though it was said that Bennett along with 5 teammates \"were most prominent for the visitors, playing good football\". In late September a concert was held by the Waiuku Rugby Union in the Town Hall where he was presented with \"the champion gold medal, won at the football race\".\nAt the start of the 1908 season Waiuku Rugby Football Union held their first ever annual meeting as they were forming a small sub-union at the Kentish Hotel. In City's first match of the season against on 17 May against Waipipi, Bennett scored 2 tries, converted one, and kicked a goal from a mark in a 14–3 win at the Waiuku Domain. Two weeks later he scored a try in a 6–3 win over Otaua at the Domain ground. They maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a 5–0 win over Waipipi with Bennett converting their only try \"from a difficult kick\". Although the Auckland Star mentioned that it was from between the posts. The Auckland Star in a report of the match named the City side as \"Central\" which was the name they had changed to at some point early in the season. Bennet was said to have played a \"sterling game\" in the backs along with V. Barriball. Central then beat Otaua on 21 June with Bennett converting one of their 4 tries. Central suffered their first defeat of the season when they lost 6–5 to Waipipi. Bennett scored all Central's points when he scored a try which he converted \"from the touch line\".\nA week later Bennett played for the Waiuku side in a friendly match with the North Shore club on the Waiuku Domain. Waiuku won the match 15–0 with Bennett scoring a try which he converted, along with 2 penalties. Central then played their final match of the season and with a 3–0 win over Otaua on 12 July they secured the \"Molloy, Herrold, and Potter Silver cup and the caps\". Waiuku then played a match against Northern Wairoa at Dargaville on 25 July which was drawn 3–3. Their next match was against Auckland Juniors on 1 August (lost 6–3), and then Northern Wairoa again on 15 August. The last match was a return match on Waiuku Domain and saw Waiuku run out 14–9 winners with Bennett scoring one of their 4 tries. He was then selected in their side to play their final match of the season against Auckland Juniors on 29 August. Auckland Juniors won a \"very poor and lifeless\" game 6 points to 3.\nThe 1909 season saw very little coverage of the Waiuku competition and the only mention of Bennett came in a 4 September match against Auckland Juniors. City/Central won the Waiuku competition again after 2 rounds and there was no need for a third round. In the 4 September match, played at Alexandra Park, The Auckland Juniors beat Waiuku 25–6 with Bennett kicking both of Waiuku's penalties near the end of the match. \"The New Zealand Herald\" reported that he \"stood out on his own in the Waiuku team\"\nMove to the City rugby club in Auckland.\nIn 1920 Bennett moved to Auckland and joined the City Rugby Club. He made his debut for them in a match against Parnell on 28 May at Alexandra Park on the No. 1 field. City won 6–3 but it was said in the Observer newspaper that \"Bennett, a recruit from Waiuku, did not shape very satisfactorily. He may have been suffering from \"grandstand fright\", but still he does not appear to be any great gun\". The Herald also commented that \"Bennett at threequarters may have been nervous but his failure to take high kicks caused his side a lot of anxiety. He may overcome this fault in a couple of games\". He was not to get another chance to redeem himself as he was not selected for City's matches with Ponsonby or University on 4 and 18 June respectively. And then he made the switch to the rugby league code.\nRugby league.\nJoins Newton Rangers rugby league club.\nOn 25 June Bennett appeared for Newton Rangers in the Auckland Rugby League first grade competition. He scored 3 tries in their 16–5 win on Victoria Park. His first try came when he took a pass from Bonner and scored under the posts. The second was after Bradburn punted over the North Shore backs and \"Bennett followed on very quickly, and snapping up the oval, raced across the line\". He scored again a few minutes later but failed to convert his try, and he had missed 2 shots at goal earlier in the match. Surprisingly following their next match against Ponsonby United on 2 July he was selected in the Auckland trial match to help the selectors choose the team to play the touring England team. He was picked in the B Team in the second row. The match was played on Victoria Park on 16 July before a crowd of 2,000. Bennett scored 2 tries in a 20–18 loss. He played well enough to be named after the match in the reserves for Auckland. His weight was listed in the \"Auckland Star\" as 13st, 10lbs. He ultimately did not take the field in the match as substitutions were only allowed for first half injuries. Bennett was also chosen in the New Zealand extended 17 man squad to play England but was not required to play in the 30 July test. On 27 August he played for a Combined club side against City Rovers who had won the championship before 300 spectators. He scored a try in an 8–6 win to the combined team.\nAuckland selection.\nBennett was then chosen for Auckland's seven match Southern Tour. Prior to departing the touring Auckland side played an Auckland selection made up from the best players not going on the tour. Auckland won the match easily 49–6 at the Auckland Domain with Bennett scoring 1 of their 16 tries. Bennett played in the first tour match against Wanganui at Cooks Gardens in Whanganui on 22 September. Auckland won the match 15–14 with Bennett scoring a first half try. The Wanganui Herald reported that \"the best of the Aucklanders on the play were Bennett, Dunning, and Fricker (forwards)…\" He then played 5 days later on 27 September against Bluff at Queens Park, Invercargill. He set up Auckland's first try in a 42–12 win after he received the ball at the Bluff 25 and \"running strongly, fed Seagar, as his nearest attendant, enabling the latter to score near the posts\", he failed to convert the try however. In total he missed 5 conversions but was successful with 2. Auckland played Southland the very next day and won 17–12, once again on Queens Park in Invercargill. Before a crowd of 2,000 Bennett scored twice. His first try came after Auckland drove Southland back to their line and from loose play Bennett and Charles Dunning combined for Bennett to score to make it 6–3 to Auckland. His second saw him win a race to the ball after it was kicked ahead into the Southland in goal area to make it 11–3 in Auckland's favour. Although Auckland played 4 more matches on the tour Bennett only played in the first of those against a combined Otago/Southland team on 1 October at the Caledonian Ground in Dunedin. Before 1,500 spectators Auckland won 30–18 with Bennett crossing the line for another try. He was involved in a passing movement with Lionel Nolan and Sid Kean which saw the later score, and then \"a moment later Bennett got away, fooled the full-back with a feint to pass, and scored under the posts\" to give Auckland a 17–13 lead. Auckland played matches against Nelson, Hawke's Bay, and Dannevirke before returning to Auckland.\nNewton Rangers management committee.\nIn 1911 Bennett was selected on the Newton Rangers management committee at their annual meeting on 31 March at the Caledonian Hotel. He then played in practice matches against North Shore and Ponsonby on 6 and 13 May respectively before beginning the Myers Cup 1st Grade championship on 20 May with another match against Ponsonby which they lost 19–3. They then lost to City Rovers 16–3 in round 2 and had a bye in round 3. Bennett was chosen for the Auckland side to play New Zealand on 10 June. The New Zealand side was preparing to depart for their tour of Australia. Bennett scored 2 tries in a 16–14 loss for Auckland in the match which was played at the Takapuna Racecourse. It appears that he played in the hooker position due to his listing second in the forwards alongside props Jim Griffin and Harry Fricker. \"The New Zealand Herald\" said \"Bennett, who was playing a fine game, took the ball on at his feet, and well supported by other Auckland forwards, play was carried to within a few yards of New Zealand's line\". A short time later Bennett failed to convert Fricker's try. Early in the second half with Auckland on attack \"Bennett wedged his way through the last line of defence and scored\". Soon after he led the forwards in a forward rush that took play to midfield and after a back line passing rush they scored. His second try came with the score 13–11 in New Zealand's favour, with Auckland making a forward attack that \"culminated in Bennett scoring\" to make it 14–13 to Auckland. New Zealand scored with a few minutes to go to claim victory.\nBennett then resumed his club season with Newton and kicked 2 conversions in a 13–8 win over Eden Ramblers, and a penalty in a 17–2 loss to North Shore. Against Ponsonby in round 6 he had the distinction of scoring all of his sides 13 points through 3 tries and 2 conversions, however Newton were still well beaten by 32 points to 13. He kicked 2 penalties in another loss a week later against City by 32 points to 12. Bennett was captaining the side and the Auckland Star commented that \"the skipper of the side, Bennett, is one of the strongest forward players in the league, and his determined dashes, while gaining ground for his side, add energy to the despairing hopes of players about to cave in. Bennett evidently is a firm believer in the maxim, \"while there's life there's hope\" and never showed it more than on Saturday... Bennett led his team in a dashing manner to the assault on the City line, and kept flagging spirits up to the last. His goal-kicking was particularly bright, but in this respect he is a man who shows best with difficult kicks\".\nFollowing a match against Eden on 22 July which Newton won 8–0 Bennett was selected for Auckland's match against the returning New Zealand team. This time Auckland won the match 11–3 before a crowd of 700 at the Takapuna Racecourse. Bennett missed a conversion but was involved in several prominent pieces of play, at one point nearly scoring in the corner.\nAuckland selection and season point record.\nBennett was then chosen for 6 of Auckland's 7 matches in their representative programme and finished the season with 27 points for them. More than any other player. His first match against a domestic side was with Wellington on 5 August at Victoria Park before 5,000 spectators. He scored a try in a 16–8 win. His try came in the second half when, after some forward play near the Wellington line he \"fell across with the ball and scored in a good position\" to give Auckland an 11–8 lead. A week later in a 36–22 win over Lower Waikato at Frankton near Hamilton, Bennett scored 4 tries. The first came after Frank Morse kicked ahead and Bennett won the race to the ball. The second came from Jim Rukutai taking a pass from Robinson, which he sent back, and then on to Bennett who scored. He scored his third after a series of scrums near the corner, while he added a fourth late in the match. He played in Auckland's next match against Hawke's Bay despite not being initially selected. Auckland won 17-13 at Victoria Park on August 19 and he then played again for Auckland against Nelson at Victoria Park on 26 August before 5,000 spectators. Auckland won easily 36–12 though Bennett did not score. After the match he was chosen for Auckland's match with Taranaki. Auckland won 26–15, once again at Victoria Park with a record crowd of 6,000 in attendance. A week later on 9 September Bennett scored 2 tries in a 22–10 win over the touring Hawke's Bay Māori side at the Takapuna Racecourse. Bennett opened Auckland's scoring with a long range try. He made a break from \"his own 25, and having a clear run out-paced all his opponents, placing the ball between the visitors' posts, 20 minutes after play started\". Charles Dunning converted the try to make the score 5–0. In the second half he broke away and scored again but his conversion attempt hit the post. Immediately after the kick off he made another break but a forward pass cost a try. Auckland played one further match against a Country side however Bennett was not selected. He finished the representative season having played 7 matches and scored 9 tries, 3 more than the famous Albert Asher with 6.\nBroken leg.\nThe 1912 season was a short one for Bennett, ended in round 2 when he sustained a broken leg. Newton held their annual meeting in early April and he was once again elected for their management committee and was chosen as a delegate to the Auckland Rugby League. At the meeting it was also decided that Bennett, along with Arthur Francis, and George Gillett (both dual New Zealand rugby union and rugby league internationals) would be the senior team selectors for the year. In a brief write up of Newton's prospects for the season the New Zealand Herald wrote that Bennett was \"last season's crack forward\". Bennett's first match was against Eden Ramblers in round 1 on 8 May and he scored a try in a 28–9 win. The Auckland Star said that \"in the forwards Bennett gave a fine exhibition. He keeps with the ball and proved dangerous in the loose\".\nThe following week against North Shore Bennett scored once more in a 24–8 win at the Devonport Domain. The Herald reported that \"Bennett, one of the Newton threequarters, had a small bone in one of his ankles displaced, and this will keep him out of the game for a month or so. Until he was hurt Bennett did much useful work\". The injury was however more serious than thought and he missed the remainder of the season which saw Newton win their first ever first grade championship with an 8 win, 2 loss record. Bennett also missed the entire Auckland representative program.\nAt the start of the 1913 the Auckland Star noted that \"Bennett, who spent the greater part of last season on the touchline owing to having had his leg broken in his second match led Newton as captain\". He had again been elected to the management committee for Newton. Prior to the season commencing Mr. J.C. Gleeson had offered to present gold medals to the members of the Auckland team which had successfully retained the Northern Union Challenge Cup through the 1911 season of which Bennett was a part of.\nBennett was also in the news for another reason. He was a painter by trade and while working on a house on the corner of Ruatangata Road (Rautangi Road) and Mt. Eden Road he had an amount of paint stolen. The thief, Richard Sheppard Rowe had left a trail of paint from the house to his house across the road where a detective the following day found a shed finished in the same red colour as Bennett's missing paint. Rowe was fined £5 and costs.\nReturn to play in 1913.\nIn Newton's first game of the season on 3 May he kicked a conversion and a penalty in a 13–10 loss to North Shore. Bennett then scored a try and kicked a conversion in a 46–0 win over Eden at the Auckland Domain. Following a 22–5 win over Manukau, Newton lost 5–0 to City Rovers. Bennett and Brockliss were reported to have been \"the pick of the Newton forwards\". He scored a try in Newton's 17–12 win over City in round 6, and following a win over Ponsonby in round 7 the first grade competition was ceased with Newton runners up to North Shore. A knockout competition was then played with Bennett kicking a conversion in their 17–0 win over North Shore. The \"Herald\" said that he \"worked like a trojan in the forwards, and led his men in good style\". Though Newton finished runner up in this competition too after losing 25–5 to City in the final. Bennett was said to have \"worked hard\" in the forwards along with Bradburn. Auckland played 10 representative matches during the season however Bennett was not selected for any of them.\nThe 1914 season was a busy one for Bennett. He played all of Newton's matches and in all four of Auckland's matches along with a game for Auckland Colts against a Veteran side. Although by this point Bennett was 30 years old himself. In round 1 against Grafton Athletic Bennett scored a try in a 12–9 win. Thought the New Zealand Herald said Newton were disappointing and \"the forwards, following the example of captain, Bennett, spent a great deal of time loafing off side. Bennett, however made up to some extent for his laziness by securing a good try after a determined charge through the ranks of the black and whites\". Newton then lost to City 16–0 before a 10–10 draw with Otahuhu at Ōtāhuhu. The Herald this time said that \"of the red and whites' weighty vanguard Bennett played much the best game\". A loss to North Shore followed before another loss to Ponsonby, though Bennett set up Newton's only try in the 17–3 result. Bennett then scored a try in a 15–4 win over Grafton at Victoria Park, before kicking a penalty goal in a 21–8 loss to City. He was taking all of Newton's goal attempts at this time. Newton then handed Otahuhu their first victory when they were defeated by the team from South Auckland 10 points to 5. The Auckland Star reported that \"Bennett was undoubtedly the star of the Newton pack. He was in the forefront of the attack, and worked untiringly the whole game\". The week after the loss Newton only managed to field 8 players in a 43–2 thrashing by North Shore with two spectators joining in to help Newton. It is unknown if Bennett was one of the eight players, though given he was captaining the side this season it is likely he played.\nDespite Newton's predicament Bennett's individual form had been good enough to be selected for an Auckland trial match to help choose the side before the England teams tour. Ponsonby and North Shore's players were unavailable due to them playing in the championship final. The players were therefore made up from Newton, City, Otahuhu and Grafton. Bennett was then selected by McDonald, Blakey, and Rowe for the Auckland side to take on England. Though the New Zealand Herald had a brutal assessment of his selection stating \"with one exception, the forwards all deserve their places in the team, though why Bennett was selected one finds hard to understand. The Newton man has passed his best long since, and these are a dozen better forwards now in Auckland who should have had consideration before him.\nThe match with England was played at the Auckland Domain and saw England win easily by 34 points to 12 before a crowd estimated at around 13,000. Footage of the match still exists and is available online at the NGĀ TAONGA Sound and Vision website. England scored two early converted tries before \"Bennett charged down a kick by an English forward\", it ultimately led to nothing however. With England leading 15–2, Edward Fox \"engineered a promising opening for Bennett, who sprinted try wards with the defence beaten. A better turn of speed would have crowned the effort but with a defender close upon his heels Bennett desperately swung the ball out to a wing man hustling to the rescue. And Englishman however secured possession, only to be promptly floored, and in the ensuing melee the visitors were penalised for offside and Karl Ifwersen taking the kick, the scoreboard again changed\". The Herald described his run as \"magnificent\". In the second half Bennett dribbled the ball \"at the head of the pack\" and with play carried to the line Jim Clark scored to make the score 21–10. After the match the Herald remarked that \"Bennett, who had the ball put in his hands and made a sensational dash for the line, is a light of other days\". The Observer however said that Charles Savory, Jim Clark, and Bennett were \"conspicuous amongst the Auckland vanguard\".\nBennett was not selected for the New Zealand team to play in the test match the following week at the same venue. He was however chosen in an Auckland XIII to play the North Shore side as a curtain-raiser. The Auckland side won 18–9. Bennett was then picked for the Auckland team to play Waikato at the Auckland Domain on 8 August. Auckland won by 29 points to 8. Bennett scored their first try after a \"pretty piece of passing\" led to him crossing wide out. He was then involved in another passing movement with J McDonald and Edward Fox led to Jim Clark scoring. He was then selected to play against Taranaki at Victoria Park on 15 August. Before a crowd of 4,000 Auckland had an easy 35–4 win. Bennett once again crossed the line first in response to a penalty goal to Taranaki before Auckland poured on the points. Then a week later he was chosen for Auckland's final representative match of the season against Wellington. Auckland won a much closer match by 10 points to 6, once again at Victoria Park before 4,000 spectators meaning that they had retained the Northern Union Challenge Cup. With Auckland leading 5–0 \"Bennett ran through the Wellington team, but was collared by the fullback, and in the melee Stan Walters and Harold Denize were put out of action with cuts in the head\". The Observer said that \"Bennett, Walters, and Savory were the pick of the forwards\". To finish the season a match was played between a Veterans side and an Auckland Colts side as part of the Patriotic Fund carnival at Victoria Park on 29 August. Bennett was selected in the Colts side as he was obviously viewed as young enough, due to the makeup of the Veteran forward pack which include Alex Stanaway, Jack Stanaway, Jim Rukutai, Jim Griffen, Tom Avery, Charles Brockliss, W Baskeville, Charles Dunning, and William Tyler. The Veteran side won the match 23 points to 13 before 1,500 spectators.\nThe 1915 season saw Bennett in his sixth season for Newton. Following an 8 May, round 1 loss to City the \"Observer\" said that the \"Newton forwards worked with a will, and perhaps Bennett calls for special mention\". In round 2 Newton lost 24–3 to North Shore with Bennett scoring their lone try. Then the following week he scored their only points from a penalty in a 14–2 loss to Ponsonby United at the Auckland Domain. They lost again to Grafton in round 4, 15 to 11 though Bennett was mentioned along with Dick Tobin, Alan Blakey, Potae, and R. Clark as being \"the most prominent of the Newton players\".\nAt this point in the season a patriotic match was planned for 3 July to make up part of the \"Patriotic Carnival\" at the Auckland Domain. The Grafton Athletic club asked permission for Bennett to play for them. On 12 June a special seven-a-side tournament was played in aid of the Auckland Hospital Ship and Wounded Relief Fund at Victoria Park. Bennett was named in the Newton side. They beat Grafton B 10–0 in the first round, City B in the second round with Bennett scoring a try in the 15–10 win, before losing to North Shore 3 points to 2 in the semi-final.\nOn 19 June Newton registered their first, first grade win of the season with a 18–6 win over Otahuhu Rovers. Bennett scored a try and kicked 2 conversions. Against City a week later in a 16–13 loss Bennett was singled out by the Observer. They stated \"Bennett was good when he liked, but seemed very tired. It is a pity that such a good player should mar his play by continually talking and appealing. The referee sees most things, and, to say the least, it is rather amusing to see a long red and white arm held up in the air when the owner should be in the pack 'doing his bit'\". Newton then beat North Shore and Ponsonby with Bennett scoring a try in the later match. He then scored another try in their loss to Grafton. The New Zealand Herald said that he \"was the pick of the forwards, but only one good opening came his way during the match, and a try resulted\". The \"Observer\" also said he was the pick of the forwards and \"the burly skipped led his men in fine style, and seized every opportunity that offered\".\nNewton ultimately finished second to last in the championship and then found themselves up against the last placed team, Otahuhu in the first round of the Roope Rooster. Newton won at Otahuhu by 24 points to 9. In round 2 they drew 2–2 with Grafton in windy, rainy conditions. The \"Auckland Star\" said that Bennett along with Rope \"were outstanding for bustling, energetic play. The former was always as sturdy in defence as he was vigorous in the forward attack\".\nBennett's form was good enough to gain selection for the Auckland team to play Thames on 28 August. Auckland won by 27 points to 16 in front of 4,000 at Victoria Park. Bennett was involved in an early attacking move and then a while later after a break, passed the ball to Cross who scored between the posts. He later missed a conversion attempt but then some time afterwards he \"broke away with the leather, and kicked over the line, and Walters, who followed up fast, fell on it\" to score. The Herald stated later that \"Bennett, Rodgers, and Walters were the most conspicuous\" of the Auckland forwards, and that Bennett \"put in a great afternoon's work and undoubtedly was the best of the pack\". A week later he played in the return match with Thames at Dodd's Paddock, Parawai in Thames. Thames won this time by 25 points to 13. Bennett was involved in one attacking movement but overall had a more quiet match.\nBennett's final match of the year was in the Roope Rooster final against North Shore. Newton lost narrowly by 10 points to 7 with Bennett scoring a try and kicking a penalty. On 18 September some patriotic matches were played in aid of the Waistcoat Fund which had been inaugurated by the Mayoress of Devonport. The matches were played at the Devonport Domain with a City Juniors v Rest of Auckland game, followed by a Referee's Association side playing the Junior Advisory Board, amongst other lower grade matches. Bennett was put in charge of the referees match as the referee.\nIn 1916 Bennett was once again named the captain of Newton. At the annual meeting of Newton Rangers, Mr. R. Spinley who was representing the Auckland Rugby League said that \"the good work of Joe Bennett (Newton's captain), and Alan Blakey and H. Rowe (ex-players) would be remembered for many a day\". In the opening round Newton lost heavily to Grafton Athletic 33 to 7. Bennett scored a try and kicked a penalty, with the Auckland Star saying that he \"was the mainstay of the red and white pack, and at times he made some really good openings. Most of these however, went begging owing to the failure of the backs to give support in anything like a decent manner\". The Newton side was struggling with a relatively weak forward pack with Bennett at the helm. They recorded their 4th consecutive loss on 10 June to Ponsonby 38–5 with only 11 players arriving for kick off. The Star reported that \"the most useful man of the Newton teams was Bennett, its efficient skipper, to whom is probably due the credit for the only try secured by his side\". Newton ultimately finished last with a 2 win, 8 loss record. In round 1 of the Roope Rooster Bennett scored a try in a 22–8 win over Otahuhu Rovers at Victoria Park with Bennett involved in his fair share of the work along with George and Arthur Iles, Thomas, Potier, and Castles.\nAs a signal of the respect that Bennett was held in, in rugby league circles, he was one of 5 players nominated for a gold medal competition for the most popular player in Auckland rugby league. The other players were Thomas (Scotty) McClymont (Ponsonby), Albert Asher (City), Karl Ifwersen (Grafton), and B Farrelly (Otahuhu). The results of the competition, which was put to the vote by spectators and announced at halftime in the Roope Rooster semi-final between City and Newton at Victoria Park saw Bennett come in 4th spot. There were 2,500 spectators there and the winner was McClymont, who played for New Zealand and would later go on to become a long time New Zealand coach, with 714 votes. Asher was second with 547, and Ifwersen third with 230. Bennett finished fourth and Farrelly fifth. Newton also lost the match 16–3 though Bennett \"headed the forwards\" who \"worked manfully\". The Observer reported later that Bennett had \"ricked his knee\" and could not give the hooking in the scrum too much attention, the consequence being the City hooker, Duggan, beat Joe badly\". Before his injury they said that he \"was the pick of the red and white pack. Once he showed a bit of pace when he challenged Opai (Albert Asher) and incidentally got the better of him to the delight of the stand\".\nAt the end of season Newton reunion their president, Mr. C. Gray said that \"the success in placing teams regularly in the field was due to the energies of several of the old members, notably Messrs. Bennett, Blakey, Farrant and Fellowes\". Mr. R.A. Spinley of the Auckland Rugby League mentioned at the end of year function that \"the good work of Joe Bennett (Newton's captain), and Allan Blakey and H. Rowe (ex-players) would be remembered for many a day\". Newton finished the season with their annual club match at Otahuhu. Two teams were picked from club players, vice-presidents, and committee and were captained by Bennett and Farrant. Bennett's team won by 15 points to 12.\nRetirement.\nThe 1917 season was to be a short one for Bennett and saw his retirement from the sport. In mid April he was elected on to the Newton Rangers committee at their annual meeting in Alexandra Hall. It is unclear if he played in Newton's first match of the season against Ponsonby on 19 May, but the Observer noted later in the week that \"Opai Asher, Joe Bennett, L. [Len] Farrant, [Jim] Griffen, and Stanaway have been seen training\". He missed their next three matches but returned for their 20–13 win over North Shore at the Devonport Domain on 16 June. The Observer said that it was \"hard to individualise the red and white forwards, as they all played well, Bennett perhaps showing out to the most advantage. We notice by the way that he has not yet got rid of his habit of appealing to the referee for some breach, his arm in the air being very conspicuous at times\". Then in their next match against Ponsonby on 30 June he came in for some criticism from the same newspaper who said \"everybody seemed to play their best with the exception perhaps, of Bennett (Newton), who was undoubtedly short of a run and at times was a long way behind the play. He played well for the first quarter but after that tired very badly\". He was to play no further matches in the season. He did not play again in 1918 nor in 1919.\nNZRL Life Membership.\nOn 4 November 1919, the New Zealand Rugby Football League held a meeting of their executive. A large contingent of applicants for life membership were put forward by the Auckland Rugby League, including Bennett and he, along with 28 others were elected life members. Some of the others elected included Arthur Myers, James Carlaw, Arthur Carlaw, Charles Dunning, Ronald McDonald, Ted Phelan, Albert Asher, Ernie Asher, and Jack Stanaway.\nOut of retirement and move to Grafton Athletic.\nSomewhat surprisingly Bennett came out of retirement aged 36 and joined the Grafton Athletic club which was led on the field by Karl Ifwersen. Perhaps motivated by his being made a life member of New Zealand rugby league at the end of 1919 along with the pending tour of the England team. He played in their opening game against his old Newton side who won 30–15. The only mention of Bennett was when he kicked the game off in front of a small crowd. Ernie Herring, a Grafton forward had been granted a transfer at the start of the season to the Maritime club which would also have weakened the Grafton forwards. He played again in Grafton's 25–0 loss to Maritime the following week before his third appearance against Marist on 22 May. They lost 15–3 with Bennett crossing the line but \"the ball slipping from his hand … spoilt Grafton's chance of a score\", though Horace Neal following through forced the ball for their only try. He then played in a match against City before being unavailable for the match with Devonport due to illness. Grafton was forced to default the match as Karl Ifwersen was also sick, Horace Neal injured, and Owen, Moir, and Norton were out of town.\nAuckland selection.\nIn mid June Bennett made a return to the Auckland representative side when he was selected to play at prop against the Rest of New Zealand side. The match was originally scheduled to be played mid week on 22 June but was delayed a day due to bad weather. The Auckland side won easily by 54 points to 0 at the Auckland Domain. The match was played in steady rain and become muddy as the game progressed. Bennett was involved in a passing movement which led to Auckland's second try to Bill Davidson. He threw the last pass to Bill Cloke enabling him to score their fourth try midway through the first half.\nBennett then returned to the Grafton side which registered another loss, 26–0 to Ponsonby. The Auckland Star said that \"Bennett, in particular, shone off prominently\". Then in their next match against Newton, another defeat by 24 points to 15, he was said to have been \"conspicuous\" along with Charles Woolley by the Herald. While the Star said that in a \"lively\" second half \"Woolley the back, and Bennett and Collins, the forwards doing best work among the Grafton men\". Bennett scored his first points for Grafton in their only win of the season which ironically was against the Maritime side which would go on to win the championship. The scores were tied 5–5 when McSweeney scored for Grafton and Bennett \"converted with a fine kick\" from the side line. Grafton held on to win 10–5.\nBennett's next match was in an Auckland trial between a A and B team. Bennett scored a try for the A side in the first half which lost 19 to 12. Following the match Bennett missed selection for the Auckland team to play the touring England side. He was not even named amongst the emergency players. The Auckland Star commented that he had \"flagged a little\".\nNew Zealand selection.\nTwo weeks after missing Auckland selection to play the tourists Bennett was named as an emergency player along with Ernie Herring for the first test between New Zealand team to play England. Bennett did play in an Auckland XIII against the North Shore side as a curtain raiser to the test. England won the first test easily by 31 points to 7. Herring ultimately did play in the first test but was replaced by Bennett for the second test. Bennett was also named to play in the North Island side to take on England in Napier midweek. England proved far too good winning the match before a crowd of 4,500 by 46 to 5. The home side did little to speak of but Bennett kicked forward on attack when the North Island trailed 28–2 but it was saved by England fullback, Cyril Stacey.\nThe second test was played on 7 August at Lancaster Park in Christchurch. Bennett was named in the second row alongside Bert Avery, with Nelson Bass at lock. He was replacing the 22 year old Herring who was moving into the reserves. New Zealand was beaten again 19–3 before a crowd of 5,000. There was no mention of Bennett in the match reports though it was noted that the New Zealand \"forwards played with some determination, but their scrum work was not up to their opponents\" and they \"played relatively better than the New Zealand backs\". He was then named in an unchanged forward pack for the third test at the Basin Reserve in Wellington. New Zealand were far more competitive and only lost by 1 point, 11–10 in cold, wet conditions before 4,000 spectators. New Zealand started well and scored two tries to take a 10–3 half time lead. Bennett had a penalty attempt at goal early in the second half but missed. England secured victory at the very end of the match with a converted try on full time.\nFollowing the test Bennett returned to Auckland along with his forward teammates who were all from Auckland. He was to finish his competitive playing career with a final round match against Devonport at the Auckland Domain. Grafton lost 13–5. The Auckland Star reporting after the match that \"Bennett and Brady played good games for Grafton in the forward line\". He did not play in Grafton's final match of the season which was a 14–3 loss to City in the Roope Rooster first round and he retired from the game.\nOld timers game.\nIn 1931 as part of a charity day planned by Auckland Rugby League for Carlaw Park and old timers match was played. Bennett was chosen for Albert Asher's team to take on Mortinsen's team. Bennett's side featured players such as Ernie Asher, Albert Asher, Jim Rukutai, Bob Mitchell, William Mincham, George Davidson, and Bill Davidson.\nPersonal life.\nJoe Bennett was a Wesleyan at the time of his enlistment in the Boer War. In 1905 Bennett married Sarah McInnes Hudson. They had three daughters, Margaret Edna (Joyce), Zoe Aroha (Jones), and Norma Bernice (b. 1914). He was a painter by trade, and in 1916 was living on Grange Road in Mt Eden. He was a reservist during World War 1 due to having 3 children. His wife, Sarah died on 24 October 1919. A death notice was published in the \"Auckland Star\" on 25 October stating \"BENNETT – On Friday, October 24, at Wiri, Sarah, the loving wife of E.J. (Joe) Bennett, aged 35 years. The funeral will leave her late residence, Wiri, at 2 p.m., Sunday, October 26\". ).\nBennett remarried in 1922 to Lilian Edith Heley. They spent the majority of their lives living in South Auckland, with most of it in the suburb of Papatoetoe. In 1922 according to electoral records they were living on Great South Road in Papatoetoe. In 1925 they had moved to Paton Avenue in the same suburb. . In 1928 Bennett's daughter, Zoe was married at St, John's Presbyterian Church in Papatoetoe. She married Stanley Jones, originally from Waiuku. The reception was held at Joe and Lilian's residence on Cornwall Road.\nA month after the wedding, on 23 July 1928, their house caught on fire when their fireplace over heated in the evening and a floor joist ignited. Fortunately the fire was discovered quickly and the volunteer fire brigade arrived \"within five minutes\" and extinguished it before \"much damage was done\". They remained at Cornwall Road until the late 1930s. Bennett advertised for painters in 1939 to assist him with a job painting a school in Te Awamutu. By 1963 Bennett was listed as retired and living at 276 Shirley Road, Papatoetoe and still living with Lilian.\nBennett died on 9 May 1965, aged 81. He was cremated at Purewa Cemetery and his ashes were scattered.\nHis wife Lilian died in April 1973. She was living at 25 Shelly Beach Road in Howick and had her ashes scattered."

        "text": "A golf society, or golfing society, is a social club, whose members are dedicated to playing the sport of golf. Unlike a golf club, a golf society does not own a golf course, instead playing on the golf courses owned by one or more golf clubs. Golf societies may form for a number of reasons, including to provide opportunities for members to play more than one course, or to avoid the associated overheads of managing a golf course.\nHistory.\nGolf societies arguably pre-date the course owning golf clubs, for in the early days of golf in Scotland it was played on common land such as at Bruntsfield, Leith and Musselburgh Links, where the societies that played golf upon the land had no prescriptive right to do so. Such prescriptive rights would not be introduced until the 17th century.\nThe Royal Burgess Golfing Society of Edinburgh makes claim to be the oldest golf society in the world. They originally met at \"various hostelries\", before settling on the Golfers Tavern on the Bruntsfield links in Edinburgh. As time went by they found themselves playing more frequently at Musselburgh Links. By 1895 they had become a more traditional golf club, purchasing a course of their own at Barton where they continue to play to this day.\nOther golf societies have since cropped up in Scotland, and across the rest of the world."

        "text": "Donovan James Mitchell (born 12 March 1997) is an American professional basketball player for the Ipswich Force of the NBL1 North. Born in Australia, he grew up in the United States and holds an Irish passport. He played college basketball for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons and Santa Clara Broncos before playing professionally in the Netherlands, Australia and Poland.\nEarly life.\nMitchell was born in Melbourne, Victoria, to American parents. His parents met in Australia during the 1990s. His father, Mike, was playing for the North Melbourne Giants in the Australian NBL in 1997.\nMitchell grew up in Fresno, California, and attended Buchanan High School in nearby Clovis, where he was a three-time first-team all-conference honouree with the basketball team. He was an all-state volleyball player at Buchanan.\nCollege career.\nMitchell played his first two college basketball seasons for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons. After playing in just four games as a freshman in 2016–17, he appeared in 30 games as a sophomore in 2017–18, averaging 2.9 points and 2.2 rebounds per game.\nOn 30 April 2018, Mitchell transferred to Santa Clara. He subsequently sat out the 2018–19 season due to NCAA transfer regulations.\nAs a redshirt junior in 2019–20, Mitchell played in all 33 games for the Broncos with 15 starts. He ranked third on the team in scoring (10.7 ppg) on 49.4 percent field goal shooting and was second on the team in both 3-point shooting (38.3 percent) and rebounding (5.2 pg). On 29 February 2020, he scored a career-high 25 points against Portland.\nAs a senior in 2020–21, Mitchell played in 18 games for the Broncos, starting five and averaging 6.4 points and 4.1 rebounds per game. On 16 February 2021, he scored a season-high 16 points against Loyola Marymount.\nProfessional career.\nComing out of college, Mitchell turned down an opportunity to play in Uruguay to instead begin his professional career in Ireland playing for Templeogue in the Super League while undertaking a master's degree at Griffith College. However, he left the team prior to making his debut after being lured to the Netherlands.\nOn 15 October 2021, Mitchell signed with Dutch team BAL of the BNXT League. In 22 games during the 2021–22 season, he averaged 16.0 points, 8.2 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game.\nIn June 2022, Mitchell moved to Australia and joined the Gold Coast Rollers of the NBL1 North. He helped the Rollers win the 2022 NBL1 North championship. In 14 games, he averaged 18.4 points, 8.6 rebounds, 2.7 assists and 1.8 blocks per game.\nFollowing the NBL1 North season, Mitchell joined the Brisbane Bullets of the Australian NBL for the 2022–23 season. Following the Bullets' 0–4 start to the season, Mitchell was suspended for one game after being asked to leave training after having a difference of opinion with coach James Duncan over his role in the Bullets' offence. On 19 November 2022, he scored 21 points in a 90–82 loss to the Cairns Taipans. For the season, he averaged 9.56 points, 4.56 rebounds and 1.3 assists per game.\nFollowing the NBL season, Mitchell joined Polish team Śląsk Wrocław for the rest of the 2022–23 PLK season. He helped the team reach the championship series, where they lost 3–2. He averaged 5.8 points in 22 games.\nMitchell re-joined the Bullets for the 2023–24 NBL season. On 20 December 2023, he was ruled out for the rest of the season with a hip injury. He averaged five points in 15 games.\nIn April 2024, Mitchell joined the Ipswich Force for the 2024 NBL1 North season.\nPersonal life.\nMitchell is the son of Americans Mike Mitchell and Michelle Maher. His father played professional basketball in Australia and Europe while his mother played professional beach volleyball. His mother has Irish heritage through her grandparents. Through marriage, his father gained an Irish passport and played for the Irish national team. His parents later separated.\nAs a result of his Irish heritage, Mitchell also holds an Irish passport. He too is eligible to play for Ireland, which was touted as a possibility in 2021.\nMitchell has two siblings, Jaiden and Myca. Myca played volleyball at Wake Forest and Howard.\nIn 2022, Mitchell played for two of the same teams his father also played for in the NBL, the Gold Coast Rollers and Brisbane Bullets."

        "text": "The equestrian statue of Pedro I is located in Tiradentes Square, in the city center of Rio de Janeiro, in the homonymous state, Brazil. It is a national historical heritage, listed by the National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN), since 4 March 1999. It is also a Rio de Janeiro state cultural heritage, registered by the \"Instituto Estadual do Patrimônio Cultural\" (INEPAC), since 26 September 1978.\nHistory.\nA monument in honor of emperor Pedro I of Brazil was idealized by the Senate since 1824, but due to the emperor's abdication in 1831 the project was abandoned.\nIn 1854, on the occasion of the thirtieth anniversary of Brazil's Independence, the Municipal Chamber of Rio de Janeiro, by proposal of , decided to erect the statue. The proposal was also approved by emperor Pedro II.\nA contest was then held in 1855 by the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts to choose the project. The winning project was that of artist , at the time director of the Academy. , winner of the third place, was chosen to execute and cast the bronze sculptures in Paris.\nThe place chosen for the monument was the Constituição Square (today Tiradentes Square), the same place where Pedro I swore the 1824 Constitution (in the São João Theatre) and also where Tiradentes was hanged on 21 April 1792. \nThe inauguration, first set to take place on 25 March 1862, the day in which emperor Pedro I issued the 1824 Brazilian Constitution, was postponed to 30 March due to heavy rains.\nDescription.\nAs a whole, it presents emperor Pedro I on a horse, waving the 1824 Constitutional Charter in his right hand, the Brazilian provinces at the time, as well as the four great rivers of Brazil — Amazon, Madeira, São Francisco and Paraná. The allegories feature indigenous people and various species of animals — tapirs, armadillos, anteaters, capybaras — as well as golden wyverns and various other decorative motifs. \nOn the main side, below the statue, it has the inscription \"to D. Pedro I, gratitude of the Brazilian people\". The base, 3.30 meters high, is made of Carioca granite; the pedestal, 6.40 meters high, is made of bronze and the statue, also made of bronze, is 6.00 meters high."

        "title": "Henry Davies (rugby league)",
        "text": "Henry Davies is a professional rugby league footballer who plays as a forward for the Salford Red Devils in the Betfred Super League.\nIn September 2022, Davies made his Salford debut in the Super League against the Warrington Wolves.\nBackground.\nDavies was born and grew up in Cheltenham, England and started playing Rugby League late on in school.\nPlaying career.\nUniversity of Manchester.\nDavies was a prominent member of the University of Manchester 1st Team during his 4-year degree in Turning-lights-on-and-off. While best known for overrunning lines and dropping balls at crucial moments, Davies was an ever-present in the UMRLFC pack. A dominant force in the university game, Davies amassed an impressive total of three tries in just 40 appearances. He enjoyed a fierce rivalry with Adam Heal in the popular game 'Who Can Avoid Playing Prop'.\nDavies played a key role during some of UMRLFC's most successful years, winning the Two Cities' Challenge twice in 2018 and 2019 as well as the BUCS Northern Conference Cup in 2018. Davies was also pivotal in the 2017 and 2018 Christie Cup triumphs as well as the runners up finishes in 2017-18 BUCS Northern 2A and the 2017 BUCS Northern Conference Cup. Davies infamously turned up late for the 2018 BUCS National 9's Finals, making his first appearance of the tournament in the final vs Northumbria where he dropped the ball to end the game 12–8 in favour of Northumbria.\nProfessional career.\nDavies has played for Leigh Miners Rangers, Halifax Panthers and Salford Red Devils, I think.\nIn September 2022, Davies made his Salford debut in the Super League against the Warrington Wolves in a losing effort. The entire team and alumni of UMRLFC were very proud of him, until he caught the ball with his chest and carried the ball in on last tackle.\nAustralia.\nDavies made the switch to Australia for the 2023 season, playing for Coffs Harbour Comets. His season was plagued with injuries but he still enjoyed a number of appearances for the comets. Upon the completion of the season, he returned back to the UK and rejoined University of Manchester Rugby League team, realising he couldn't hack it in the big leagues he proceeded to use his stature as a fully grown man against underdeveloped 18 year olds. He also returned from Australia sporting the 'worst hair cut ever' as voted for in the 2023 Q4 edition of gentleman's quarterly magazine.\nCoaching career.\nAlongside playing for Salford, Davies coached the University of Manchester Rugby League Team, taking over from the highly lauded coach, Matt Valentine, in the 2020–21 season. His first season as coach was mired by the COVID-19 pandemic, with only a handful of friendlies permitted to be played.\nIn his second season, Davies recorded resounding success, leading the team to glory in the BUCS Northern Conference Cup 2022 and thus ending their 4-year hiatus from silverware. Under Davies' impressive guidance, UMRLFC only registered one defeat for the entire season. Unfortunately, this defeat came against league rivals UCLan resulting in the team missing out on promotion to BUCS Northern 1A for the 6th consecutive year. Despite this disappointment, Davies was still celebrated for restoring the club to the upper echelons of BUCS Northern 2A.\nAhead of the 2022–23 season, Davies made the bold call to tear up the play book and redesign both the attacking and defensive structure. Davies has received many plaudits for these changes after they saw the club romp to the elusive Northern 2A title.\nFailure.\nDespite holding records for his destructive play on the pitch, Davies is also remembered for his record-breaking tenure as Club Kit Secretary for the 2018–19 season. To this day, Davies remains the only Kit Secretary to have forgotten the kit, for an away fixture at Huddersfield. This resulted in the team playing in the Huddersfield Giants academy kit, to much derision.\nIn 2023, Davies attempted to grow a mullet, having been inspired by his 5 minutes living in Australia. Unfortunately, it isn't an easy task for a folically challenged male to grow a mullet and as such it was described as a 'lollipop that had been dropped on a carpet' by an unnamed former UMRLFC committee member."

        "title": "2021 Rugby League World Cup",
        "text": "The 2021 Rugby League World Cup (RLWC2021) was a collection of world cups in the sport of rugby league, held in England from 15 October to 19 November 2022.\nEngland won hosting rights for the competition on 27 October 2016. The bid received £25 million UK government support, partnered with the UK Cabinet Office as part of a commitment to the Northern Powerhouse, with 87 percent of all matches to be held in northern towns and cities. Organisers initially planned for the tournaments to go ahead between 23 October and 27 November 2021 despite the COVID-19 pandemic but withdrawals from Australia and New Zealand over \"player welfare and safety concerns\" caused the tournaments to be postponed – with the event's chief executive admitting that a World Cup without those teams would have lacked credibility.\nFor the first time, the men's, women's, and wheelchair tournaments were held concurrently as centrepiece events with all participants being paid the same. 32 teams (16 men, 8 women, and 8 wheelchair) from 20 nations competed across 61 matches. Australia men beat Samoa 30–10 to win a record-extending 12th title, Australia women beat New Zealand 54–4 to win a record-equalling third title, and England wheelchair team beat France 28–24 to win a record-equalling second title. Additional competitions under the Festival of World Cups banner were also planned to take place but were cancelled due to fundraising and squad selection issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its cancellation, an inaugural Physical Disability Rugby League World Cup (PDRL) and a Masters Rugby League event were rescheduled to take place alongside the main competitions. England beat New Zealand 42–10 in the final to become the inaugural PDRL World Cup champions.\nAll 61 matches in the men's, women's, and wheelchair competitions were broadcast live, with the opening and closing matchdays of the physical disability competition also receiving UK coverage via BBC Sport. Along with official sponsors and partners, organisers announced numerous projects to focus on the long-term impact of the Rugby League World Cup. Named \"InspirationALL\", this included a £10 million fund from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport to enable sports clubs to develop their facilities.\nHost selection.\nThere were initially three bids for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup, but the United Arab Emirates' bid was cancelled due to the arrest of Sol Mokdad at the behest of UAE rugby union officials.\nEngland, and the United States and Canada were the two remaining bidders of the event. The English RFL received UK government support – £15 million to enhance the tournament and up to a further £10 million into the game's infrastructure – for the event to be staged in the country. The RFL mentioned they wanted the event to be the most attended in history with over 1,000,000 people attending the grounds over the tournament's days. They were also planning to use 12 venues for the event which included non-purpose and rugby league-purpose stadiums.\nThe United States and Canada bid was initially a sole United States bid from an Australian sports–marketing agency, Moore Sports International (MSI). Eight to ten cities, featuring a mix of National Football League and soccer-specific stadiums, were planned for the event, offering the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) the opportunity to stage the tournament outside of Europe and Australasia for the first time. Canada Rugby League later announced they wanted to be a part of the United States bid stating that the cities of Vancouver and Toronto could also potentially host matches.\nOn 27 October 2016, the RLIF announced that England had won hosting rights for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.\nNations.\nA total of 20 Nations are involved across the three major tournaments:\nNote: M=Men's tournament, W=Women's tournament, WC=Wheelchair tournament\nVenues.\nThe full list of 21 venues to be used for the three tournaments (men's, women's and wheelchair) was announced on 29 January 2019. Seventeen venues were used for the men's tournament and in addition Preston and York were announced as a training venue for the tournaments. Four of those same venues (DW Stadium, Headingley Stadium, MKM Stadium, and Old Trafford) as well as the York Community Stadium were used for the women's tournament. Three further venues (Copper Box Arena, English Institute of Sport, and Manchester Central) will host the Wheelchair tournament. Base camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 10 June 2020, these locations were released. All three tournaments held their final in Manchester, with the Wheelchair tournament concluding on 18 November, and the women's and the men's finals taking place in a double-header the day after at Old Trafford.\nOrganisers partnered with the UK Cabinet Office as part of a commitment to the Northern Powerhouse. The UK's Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government and the Northern Powerhouse minister welcomed the news that 87 percent of matches (including all three finals) would be held in the North, exceeding a previous 80 percent commitment from organisers in receipt of £25 million government funding. This attracted some criticism from Rugby League expansionists unhappy about the lack of games throughout the country outside of the traditional M62 Corridor.\nThe use of the as-yet unbuilt Workington Community Stadium was initially a venue for three group matches in the men's tournament but was later cancelled. The venue was first thrown into doubt after the 2019 Allerdale Borough Council election when control of the council changed and the new council showed less enthusiasm for the new stadium project. In early July 2019, Allerdale Council confirmed that they would be unable to host any matches in the tournament. On 28 August 2019, it was announced that Kingston Park in Newcastle upon Tyne would host the three games originally allocated to Workington. Anfield in Liverpool were also due to host matches in both the men's and women's tournaments but became unavailable when the competition was moved from 2021 to 2022. It was replaced by the DW Stadium in Wigan.\nThe BBC's official trailer for the tournaments depicted landmarks from some of the host towns and cities. In chronological order these were; the Tyne Bridge (Newcastle), Sports Village (Leigh), Tower Bridge and its surroundings (London), the Corn Exchange (Leeds), the M62 motorway (in reference to the M62 Corridor), and Beetham Tower and its surroundings (Manchester).\nStadium locations.\nStadiums are referred to by their official name rather than sponsored name, as is International Rugby League policy.\nTeam base camp locations.\n14 base camps were used by the 32 national teams to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament, as follows:\nPostponement due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.\nThe World Cups were originally due to be held between 23 October 2021 and 27 November 2021, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent withdrawals of Australia and New Zealand caused the tournament to be postponed.\nDespite the initial date for World Cup being over a year and a half away when Covid-19 was declared a pandemic, from very early on organisers developed contingency plans to defer the events to 2022 should it become necessary to postpone in 2021. Having originally given themselves a cut off date of May 2021, organisers finally announced in July their decision to go ahead with the planned scheduling for 2021. This was despite reports that the Australian Rugby League Commission had yet to sign the participation agreement and the South Sydney Rabbitohs CEO Blake Solly claiming the preferred option from NRL clubs remained to postpone it to 2022. On a BBC rugby league poscast, RLWC2021 chief executive Jon Dutton that the option to postpone was discussed but was \"\"significantly unpalatable\" with the potential of clashing with the men's football World Cup, the women's football European Championships and the Commonwealth Games in 2022. Dutton also suggested that there would be \"a number of nations who would step up if any nation didn't take part for any reason across all three tournaments\". Just one week later, Australia and New Zealand officially declared their withdrawal from the competitions citing \"player welfare and safety concerns\".\nIn the one week between tournament organisers announcing the tournament would go ahead in 2021 and the announcement that Australia and New Zealand would withdraw, the United Kingdom had repealed its last remaining social contact restrictions on so called \"Freedom Day\" despite skyrocketing Covid-19 cases. In contrast, during that same period, half of Australia's population were placed back under lockdown and 14 NRL clubs were relocated to Queensland in order for the remainder of 2021 NRL season to be completed.\nAustralia and New Zealand faced backlash following their announcement to withdraw with RFL chairman Simon Johnson calling the decision \"selfish, parochial and cowardly\". \"The Guardian\" had previously claimed that NRL clubs were not keen on the World Cup's current scheduling because players may not return until two weeks before the start of trial games for the 2022 NRL season (and border rules dictated anyone returning to the country must spend 14 days in government-managed quarantine). Johnson also suggested that the decision had been made at boardroom-level and without the consultation of players whilst \"The Guardian\" further claimed that a survey showed 75% of players consulted by Australia's players union remained happy to travel to England. Johnson had also pointed out the difference compared to other Australian sporting bodies that were still planning to send athletes to the Tokyo Olympics from July 2021. However, former Downing Street Press Secretary and British journalist Alastair Campbell noted the differences between the lower cases and tougher restrictions in Japan compared to the higher cases and no restrictions that existed in the UK – instead blaming Simon Johnson's namesake and then-British PM Boris Johnson for wrecking the World Cup.\nOn 5 August 2021 tournament organisers announced they would postpone the World Cups to 2022 with just little more than a month away from its start with Dutton admitting that a World Cup without Australia and New Zealand would have lacked credibility.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony for all three tournaments took place at St James' Park in Newcastle on 15 October 2022 before the men's Group A match between England and Samoa. On 5 October 2022, the Kaiser Chiefs were announced as the headline act for the opening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony suffered major disruption as the PA system at St. James's Park failed resulting in most of it being curtailed. Kaiser Chiefs only managed to play one song and only the flag bearers of participating nations were called to the field before the failure. The trophies of the three tournaments were brought out without announcement from the PA. It was planned that local school children would also perform a display, however this was cut due to the curtailment. Kaiser Chiefs's lead singer Ricky Wilson entertained the crowd during the technical difficulties.\nThe PA failure also resulted in a ten minute delay to kick-off as the system was needed in order to play \"The Banner of Freedom\" and \"God Save The King\" before the match.\nCompetitions.\nFor the first time, the men's, women's, and wheelchair tournaments were held concurrently as centrepiece events with all players receiving equal pay. The draw for all the World Cup tournaments were originally scheduled to be finalised on 27 November 2019, exactly two years before the original date of the tournament final, but it was postponed until 16 January 2020. The draw was made at Buckingham Palace on 16 January 2020. For each competition teams from pool 1 were drawn by Prince Harry, Duke of Sussex, pool 2 was drawn by Katherine Grainger and pool 3 by Jason Robinson. Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage.\nMen’s tournament.\nThe 2021 Men's Rugby League World Cup was the sixteenth staging of Men's Rugby League World Cup. 16 teams competed in the tournament, an increase of two from the previous two tournaments and the first to feature 16 teams since the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. Australia are defending champions having won a record eleventh title last time out. Competing countries were divided into four groups of four teams (groups A to D).\nReigning champions Australia took on first-time finalists Samoa in the men's final. Australia beat New Zealand by two points in the semi-final to progress and went into the match having been crowned champion in 10 of the last 11 tournaments. Samoa beat the highly-ranked host nation, England, with a golden point drop goal to become the first nation outside Australia, New Zealand or Great Britain/England to reach the final since 1968. Australia, who had reached every final since 1957, were considered overwhelming favourites against a Samoa team they had beaten in the 2017 quarter-finals, 46–0.\nAustralia won their 12th title in a 30–10 victory at Old Trafford. Samoa started the match well with early pressure but Australia's strong defensive performance laid the foundations and more than lived up to their billing as overwhelming favourites. Samoa were unlucky not to have been awarded a 40/20 kick, and despite a competitive start to the match, were hit by two tries in four minutes; Latrell Mitchell breaking the deadlock on 13 minutes before Josh Addo-Carr and Liam Martin extended Australia's lead to 14–0 at half-time. After the break, Angus Crichton was sin-binned for an elbow that ruled out Chanel Harris-Tavita for the remainder of the match with a head injury, but even with a man down Australia added a fourth try through Cameron Murray. Brian To’o scored a consolation for Samoa to make it 20–6, before Tedesco and Stephen Crichton exchanged tries prior to Mitchell rounding up the scoring with his second try in the final minute.\nWomen’s tournament.\nThe 2021 tournament was the sixth staging of the Women's Rugby League World Cup and featured eight teams, an increase of two from the 2017 event. Australia were the defending champions having won their second title last time out. The teams were drawn into two groups of four. The two seeded teams were (Group A) as hosts and as holders (Group B).\nAustralia and New Zealand squared off in the women's final for the fourth consecutive time. New Zealand had previously won the tournament a record three times and had appeared in every final since the innagural event in 2000. Australia went into the match with only two previous titles but had claimed both their wins in the two most recent tournaments in 2013 and 2017. Australia had been the most dominant side throughout the tournament, amassing 258 points in their five matches prior to the final – including a 82–0 victory against Papua New Guinea in the semi-final. In contrast, New Zealand beat hosts England in the semi-final 20–6 and had already lost to Australia in the group stages, 10–8. Australia won a record-equalling third title in a dominant 54–4 thrashing. Jessica Sergis opened the scoring within six minutes into the final, before two tries from Isabelle Kelly and another from Julia Robinson gave Australia a 20–0 lead at half-time. New Zealand could not muster a response in the second-half with Emma Tonegato, Tarryn Aiken, and Sergis all extending the lead for Australia, but a Madison Bartlett try did give the Kiwis a consolation. Kennedy Cherrington and Evania Pelite concluded the scoring for Australia as they ran out as 54–4 winners, the second-highest margin of victory recorded in a final.\nWheelchair tournament.\nEight teams competed, an increase of one from 2017. They were drawn into two groups of four. France were defending champions, having won their second title in 2017. The two seeded teams were England (Group A) as hosts and as holders (Group B).\nFrance and England were considered to have \"been the best at the tournament by a distance, going through the pool stages unbeaten and then both recording comprehensive semi-final wins\" to ultimately face off against each other for a third consecutive world cup final. England overturned their \"heartbreaking defeats\" by four points in 2017 and two points in 2013 to claim their first world cup title since 2008. With the sides evenly matched, the game was not the free-scoring spectacle that earlier rounds had been and both teams produced strong defensive displays. The final did not see either team stretch a lead beyond eight points at any point during the match, with France taking an 8–0 lead early on and a narrow 14–12 scoreline into half-time. England went ahead for the first time three minutes into the second half through a try by Lewis King before Jack Brown extended their lead by eight points. 59-year-old Gilles Clausells hit back with a try whilst his nephew, Nicolas Clausells, added two goals to make it 22–22. England briefly went ahead through a penalty before Nico Clausells responded again to ensure a grandstand finish at 24–24 but later missed a further penalty to go ahead in the 75th minute. With the scores level, England captain Tom Halliwell dummied through for his second score of the match to win the game 28–24 in front of a world-record crowd of 4,526.\nFestival of World Cups.\nAdditional competitions under the Festival of World Cups banner were planned to be held in Greater Manchester in the summer prior to the three centrepiece men's, women's and wheelchair tournaments.\nThe world cup organisers asked for expressions of interest for different tournaments in the summer of 2019 and received over 90 responses. Anticipated World Cup events were:\nOn 27 August 2020 the organising body announced the postponement of the festival due to fund raising and squad selection issues for the participating nations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, though World Cup events for the physical disability and masters variants were rescheduled.\nPhysical Disability.\nThe inaugural Physical Disability Rugby League World Cup went ahead between 23 and 30 October in Warrington. Australia, England, New Zealand, and Wales competed in a single round-robin tournament with the top two teams facing off in a final at the Halliwell Jones Stadium. The draw was made for the match schedule on 29 July 2022 during an episode of Channel 4's \"The Last Leg\"; presenter Adam Hills announced his intention to be part of the Australian squad. England beat New Zealand 42–10 in the final to become world champions, whilst Wales claimed third place after a technical infringement saw the result of their opening group stage match overturned.\nInternational masters.\nThe International Masters festival went ahead on 13 November at York St John University. Australia, Canada, England, France, Ireland, and Wales took part.\nBroadcasting.\nThe Rugby League World Cup announced a partnership with the International Rugby League (IRL) in July 2020. The organisations worked together on match broadcast production and the sale of global broadcast rights.\nIn April 2019, it was reported that the digital strategy for the tournament would be led by Deloitte. In May 2019, the world cup organisers announced they were looking for an esport partner to engage new audiences with the sport.\nLegacy.\nThe legacy of the RLWC2021 is the long-term impact of the combined World Cup tournaments. Named InspirationALL in October 2018, the chairman of the world cup organising committee, Jon Dutton, said \"economic benefit is about 10% of what we’re focusing on, and 90% is the social benefit.\"\nCreated by RLWC 2021.\nThe first project launched is a £10 million fund to develop facilities under the banner of \"Created by RLWC 2021\" was launched concurrently with the legacy announcement in October 2018 and enables sports clubs to apply for funds to develop facilities The funding comes from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and £9 million is allocated for major grants (over £15,000) and £1 million for smaller applications. The fund is administered by the Rugby Football League (RFL) in conjunction with Sport England.\nThe first major grants were announced in June 2019 and saw monies allocated for the construction of new clubhouses and changing facilities at locations in Salford and Shevington. £90,000 of minor grant funding was announced in July with 20 projects across England receiving funding.\nIn May 2021 it was announced that the National Lottery (United Kingdom) partner with the tournament to strengthen the CreatedBy program and allow RLWC2021 to deliver more projects to the community clubs especially those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The investment accompanied National Lottery sponsorship on RLWC2021 matchdays.\nWheelchair teams were created by Hull KR and Salford Red Devils in response to the massive increase in popularity of wheelchair rugby league following the world cup.\nInspired by RLWC 2021.\nThe second project is \"Inspired by RLWC 2021\" which aims to get more people involved with rugby league. The first product, a resource pack on introducing and teaching rugby league in primary schools was released in July 2019.\nEmpowered by RLWC 2021.\nThe third project and yet to be launched is \"Empowered by RLWC 2021\" which has the aim of involving people in the communities where the tournaments take place both in assisting at the tournaments but also continuing that involvement with rugby league afterwards by becoming involved with community rugby league clubs.\nClimate Action.\nRLWC 2021 pledged their commitment to the United Nations Sports for Climate Action Framework in 2018. One of just four UK based sporting bodies to do so.\nTree for a Try.\nIn partnership with the tournament's Logistics Partner, Kuehne + Nagel, it was announced that for every try scored across the Men's, Women's and Wheelchair tournaments, a tree would be planted. The trees will predominantly be planted in Brazil, one of the nations competing in the Women's tournament\nCeremonial Trees.\n21 ceremonial trees will be planted across host towns and cities in England.\nAttendance and viewing.\nThe 2021 Rugby League World Cup became the most viewed edition of the World Cup with television viewing surpassing 30 million in England alone.\nBefore the start of the semi-finals, the opening match of the men's tournament saw the largest television viewing figures with 1.8 million. England vs Canada and England v Australia saw the largest viewing figures for a women's and wheelchair match respectively, both attracting a peak of 700,000.\nThe England v Papua New Guinea men's quarter final broke the record for the largest stadium audience for a Rugby League World Cup quarter final of 23,179.\nEngland v Spain broke the attendance record for a wheelchair rugby league match with 3,268 in attendance. The record previous broke by the opening match of England v Australia.\nEngland v Canada was also the highest attendance women's game in the northern hemisphere with 8,621.\nSource:\nAt the men's semi-finals stage, the 2021 semi finals were the sixth and second best attended semi-finals in world cup history attracting 28,113 and 40,489 fans respectively.\nThe men's final, attracting 67,502, was the fourth best attended rugby league world cup match in history."

Palou's qualifying speed of set a new record for fastest pole speed for the Indianapolis 500, besting the speed that his teammate Scott Dixon had set the previous year. The run also replaced Dixon's as the second-fastest qualification run at Indianapolis ever.\nJosef Newgarden passed Marcus Ericsson on a frantic restart with half a lap to go following multiple late race incidents to win his first Indianapolis 500. It was the third Indy 500 in history with a last lap pass for the win (the others being 2006 and 2011), and the first with a one-lap shootout to the finish since 1997. It was also the first Indianapolis 500 since 1973 to have the red flag put out three times and first time race was red-flagged three times in history of \"IndyCar Series\" under this title. Roger Penske (owner of Team Penske) collected his record-extending 19th Indianapolis 500 victory as an owner, and first Indy victory since purchasing the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in late 2019.\nRace background.\nSponsorship.\nOn May 25, 2022, it was announced that online financial services company Gainbridge reached a multiyear agreement to extend their presenting sponsorship of the Indianapolis 500. The extension was for an undisclosed length. This will be the first year under the current deal. Gainbridge originally signed a four-year deal which was in place from 2019 to 2022.\n2023 IndyCar Series.\nThe 2023 Indianapolis 500 was the sixth race of the 2023 NTT IndyCar Series season. Five different drivers won the first five races of the season. Marcus Ericsson won the season opener at St. Petersburg, and Josef Newgarden won the first oval race of the season at Texas. Kyle Kirkwood then won at Long Beach, his first career IndyCar victory, followed by Scott McLaughlin at Alabama. Álex Palou won the GMR Grand Prix on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway road course, and held the championship points lead going into the Indy 500.\nRace schedules.\nThe 2023 IndyCar Series schedule was announced on September 27, 2022, with the Indianapolis 500 scheduled for Sunday, May 28. Practice, time trials, and other ancillary events are scheduled for the two weeks leading up to the race. The Open Test was held on April 20–21, which included rookie orientation and refresher tests.\nThe GMR Grand Prix, including the Road to Indy races, again served as the opening weekend of track activity, on May 12–13. The Freedom 100 was left off the schedule for the fourth year in a row. The 2023 Indy NXT series (formerly known as Indy Lights) included a race on the road course during GMR Grand Prix weekend.\nEntry list.\nAll entries utilized a spec Dallara IR18 chassis with and Firestone tires. 34 entries were confirmed, including nine former winners and four race rookies. 2013 winner and 2004 champion Tony Kanaan announced that he would retire after the race.

Katherine Legge made her first appearance since 2013, the first female participant since 2021; no female drivers entered in 2022. On April 15, \"Racer\" confirmed that both Chevrolet and Honda will supply 17 entries each. With 34 confirmed entries, bumping will return for the first time since 2021. The official entry list was released on May 15.\nTesting and rookie orientation.\nA full-field open test was scheduled on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway oval for April 20–21, 2023. Katherine Legge, who has not competed in the race since 2013, took part in an oval re-acclimation test with Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing at Texas Motor Speedway on April 3. Linus Lundqvist, the 2022 Indy Lights champion, also participated in the private oval test at Texas, but did not secure a ride for the Indy 500.\nThe rookie orientation test was conducted in three phases. For phase 1, each driver was required to complete ten laps between , while demonstrating satisfactory car control, proper racing line, and safe interaction with other cars on the circuit. The laps do not have to be consecutive. Phase 2 was fifteen laps between , and phase 3 was fifteen laps over . Veteran drivers that have not competed in an IndyCar oval race since the previous year's Indy 500 are required to take a refresher test. The refresher test consists of phase 2 and phase 3 of the aforementioned rookie test.\nOpen test—Friday April 21.\nThe scheduled second day of the open test was canceled due to rain.\nPost-qualifying practice.\nSpecial test—Thursday, May 25.\nIndyCar officials announced on Wednesday, May 24 that Graham Rahal and Katherine Legge would be given a 15-minute session on Thursday to do installation laps for their cars following the accident the entries had been involved in on Monday. As a shakedown only session, IndyCar ruled that the drivers could not complete full laps around the track and were required return to the pit lane immediately after leaving.\nPit Stop Challenge.\nThe annual pit stop competition was scheduled for Friday, May 26 after the completion of Carb Day practice. 16 competing crews were announced for the event the day before. Chip Ganassi Racing won the pit stop competition with Scott Dixon's car, defeating Team Penske with Will Power's car in the best-of-three final. It was the fourth win in the pit stop challenge for Chip Ganassi Racing as well as the fourth for Dixon in the competition.\nStarting grid.\nFailed to qualify/Withdrawn\n Stefan Wilson qualified car #24, but was injured in post-qualifying practice and forced to withdraw. On May 23, Graham Rahal was named as his replacement. By IndyCar rules, the entry was moved to the back of the starting grid after the driver change\nRace report.\nFirst half.\nPrior to the race start, Graham Rahal suffered problems with the battery of his car. His crew was able to get the battery changed, but not before two laps of the race had already been completed.\nAt the start, Álex Palou took the lead of the race ahead of Rinus VeeKay and Felix Rosenqvist, while Scott Dixon moved into fourth. As the first run progressed, Palou and VeeKay swapped the lead with each other several times. Behind, Dixon began to suffer a vibration in one of his tires after 20 laps, which caused him to drop down to 16th position before finally making a pit stop to change the tires at lap 27. Shortly after, the first round of scheduled pit stops occurred, with the top two runners emerging in the same order, while Santino Ferrucci moved into third. During the pit sequence, Katherine Legge lost control of her car leaving her pit stall, spun, and hit the inside pit wall. Legge attempted to continue in the race for a few more laps, but was ultimately forced to retire after the incident. The second sequence of pit stops came beginning at lap 60, during which Arrow McLaren teammates Rosenqvist and Pato O'Ward moved into the lead of the race as the result of better fuel mileage than the cars ahead of them. O'Ward and Rosenqvist then swapped the lead with each other during the duration of the stint.\nThe first caution period of the day came at lap 91, when Sting Ray Robb slid wide and crashed into the outside wall of turn 1 after being passed by Graham Rahal. Robb was uninjured in the accident. During the caution, most drivers elected to make pit stops. During the stops, Rinus VeeKay lost control of his car exiting his pit stall and spun, collecting Álex Palou in the process. While both of the early leaders were able to continue in the race, Palou dropped deep in the field after being forced to change the front wing on his car from the damage, while VeeKay received a drive-through penalty for causing the incident. Neither driver led for the remainder of the race. Rosenqvist, O'Ward, and Ferrucci led drivers off of pit lane, while Callum Ilott took the lead of the race by being the only driver not to pit under the caution.\nSecond half.\nRacing resumed on lap 100, with Rosenqvist and O'Ward passing Ilott immediately to take the lead of the race again. Further behind, Marcus Ericsson and Josef Newgarden had excellent restarts, moving forward several spots to take fifth and sixth respectively. After a few laps, action calmed again and Rosenqvist and O'Ward resumed their swapping of the lead. With the previous pit stop coming with awkward timing for strategy, the pace of the race slowed greatly as teams tried to reach their target fuel window, with laps being turned at only for several laps. Pits stops came again starting at lap 132. Rosenqvist emerged as the leader, but O'Ward suffered a slow stop that dropped him back. Newgarden and Ericsson emerged from the pits second and third, but both passed Rosenqvist shortly after, and Ericsson then passed Newgarden for the lead. Alexander Rossi moved to fourth place, while Santino Ferrucci ran fifth. During the pit stops, an incident occurred in the pit lane when Colton Herta left his stall while Romain Grosjean was entering his, causing the two to collide. Both continued in the race, though losing significant time. \nThe second caution period of the race came on lap 149, when Romain Grosjean lost control of his car in turn 2 and impacted the outside wall. During the caution, some cars chose to pit, most notably Pato O'Ward, who had problems refueling his car on the previous pit stop and so required an extra stop compared to the cars around him. Racing resumed at lap 156, with Newgarden taking the lead from Ericsson before both were passed by Ferrucci one lap later. Rosenqvist and Rossi ran fifth and sixth, while Kyle Kirkwood moved himself to sixth and Álex Palou moved to seventh after recovering from his earlier incident. The running order remained roughly the same until the start of the final round of pit stops starting at lap 169. Ferrucci lost time after a tire rolled out from his pit box during his stop; he avoided any time penalty for the infraction. Ericsson emerged the leader of the group that pitted, with Rosenqvist and Newgarden behind. Leading the race were the drivers who had pitted during the caution, with O'Ward leading until lap 180, when he pitted. O'Ward emerged from the pits in third place, and quickly moved past both Rosenqvist and Ericsson to be first of the cars not needing any more pit stops. \nFirst red flag.\nOn lap 184, Josef Newgarden passed Felix Rosenqvist entering turn 1. Rosenqvist slid wide in the wake of Newgarden's car and impacted the outside wall. Rosenqvist attempted to retain control of the car, but lost control entering turn two and spun. As he spun backwards onto the racing surface, Rosenqvist collected Kyle Kirkwood, which completely dislodged the left-rear tire on Kirkwood's car. Kirkwood impacted the outside wall in turn 2 heavily, with the impact causing the car to flip over and slide to a halt upside down. Neither Rosenqvist nor Kirkwood were injured in the accident. During the incident, the dislodged tire from Kirkwood's car was launched above the catch-fencing outside of turn 2 and out of the race track. The tire went over a grandstand and landed on the left front end of a Chevrolet Cruze that was parked in a lot between two sections of seating outside turn two. Robin Matthews, the owner of the damaged car, received a tour of the speedway as compensation. On June 1, four days after the race, Indianapolis Motor Speedway management announced that they would be presenting Matthews with a new car.\nWith the circuit needing significant cleanup from the accident, IndyCar officials halted the race with the red flag with 14 laps to go. This was done to provide an opportunity to finish the race under green, and to not waste too many laps circulating under the yellow flag. Ryan Hunter-Reay held the lead at the time of the red flag, but he along with Callum Ilott and Agustín Canapino would need to pit as soon as the race resumed.\nSecond red flag.\nThe race resumed under caution on lap 187. The three cars at the front needing a pit stop did so immediately, handing the lead to Pato O'Ward. The field was preparing to go back to green with 9 laps to go. However, the officials deemed that O'Ward was taking the field down too slowly, and waved off the restart by an extra lap.\nGreen flag racing resumed on lap 193 (8 laps to go), with Newgarden and Ericsson passing O'Ward heading into turn one. O'Ward attempted to pass Ericsson back at turn three, but lost control of his car, spun several times and impacted the outside wall. O'Ward's accident caused a chain of accidents behind. Scott McLaughlin collided with Simon Pagenaud as the field slowed to avoid O'Ward, which sent Pagenaud into the outside wall while McLaughlin suffered damage to the nose of his car. Agustín Canapino was forced into the grass trying to avoid McLaughlin, causing him to lose control of his car and also hit the wall. After the initial impact, Canapino's car was damaged to the point where he could no longer steer or slow it. As a result, Canapino hit the already stricken car of O'Ward, causing Canapino to briefly become airborne. None of the drivers involved were injured in the accident.\nThe leaders crossed the start/finish line, accepting the yellow with 7 laps to go. With another major cleanup needed, IndyCar officials again decided to put the red flag out again. The next time by, the field was parked in the pits under red. At the time of the second red, Newgarden led Ericsson with Santino Ferrucci third.\nThird red flag and finish.\nThe cars rolled from the pit with six laps to go. After two laps under yellow, the green came out with four laps to go. Ericsson immediately passed Newgarden, but another accident occurred just as Ericsson moved ahead. As cars exited turn four coming to the green flag, a five- car accident involving Christian Lundgaard, Ed Carpenter, Benjamin Pedersen, Graham Rahal, and Marco Andretti occurred, bringing out another caution period. IndyCar officials made the decision to red flag the race for a third time - the first time in Indianapolis 500 history that three late-race red flags occurred. As the red flag came with only two laps remaining in the race, officials decided that the race would restart as soon as cars reached the start finish line again for the final lap.\nThe cars rolled from the pits one last time with two laps remaining. This provided them with just one lap to warm up their car and warm up their tires. The first time around racing resumed with the green flag and white flag flying together. It was the final lap with Ericsson getting an initial jump on Newgarden going into turn one. Newgarden was able to catch up to Ericsson and made a slingshot pass for the lead down the backstraight. He stayed in front for the remainder of the lap to win, securing his first Indianapolis 500 victory in his 12th start in the event. Newgarden's victory was the first for an American driver since 2016, while it was the 19th Indianapolis 500 victory for Team Penske. After winning, Newgarden stopped on the front straight, climbed from his car, then climbed through a gap in the catch fencing to celebrate with fans before returning for the official celebration ceremony in the winners circle. In winning, Newgarden became the first driver from Tennessee to take victory in the 500. Newgarden earned $3.666 million for winning from a record purse of $17,021,500. As well, his win made Caitlyn Brown, his left-front tire changer, the first known woman to be part of an over-the-wall tire-changing pit crew for a driver while that driver won the Indy 500. Second-place finisher Marcus Ericsson became the first defending winner to finish second since Hélio Castroneves in 2003. Santino Ferrucci in third place achieved his career best finish in the race and achieved the best finish for A. J. Foyt Racing since 2000. Despite being involved in the final accident, Benjamin Pedersen was the highest finishing rookie in the race in 21st and was named Rookie of the Year for 2023.\nThe decision to red flag the race for a one-lap run to the finish was met with criticism from runner-up finisher Marcus Ericsson, who called the ruling \"unfair and dangerous\" and cited that IndyCar had never done a restart in that way any time prior. Other competitors, such as 3rd place finisher Santino Ferrucci and 16th place finisher Tony Kanaan felt that IndyCar's decision was the correct one, citing complaints from previous editions of the race about ending under caution periods.\nBox score.\n Former Indianapolis 500 winner\n Indianapolis 500 Rookie\nAll entrants utilized Firestone tires.\n Points include qualification points from time trials, 1 point for leading a lap, and 2 points for most laps led.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nThe race was televised on NBC and Peacock Premium in the United States. Mike Tirico and Danica Patrick returned for pre-race and post-race coverage, as they had together since 2019. Leigh Diffey, Townsend Bell, and James Hinchcliffe were the booth announcers for the race. Two additional hours of pre-race coverage on race day morning was carried exclusively on Peacock.\nOn May 8, 2023, it was confirmed that, in line with longstanding policy that had been suspended during the COVID-19 pandemic, the live broadcast would be blacked-out in the Indianapolis area on both local television and Peacock, marking the first Indy 500 local blackout since the 2019 Indianapolis 500.\nIn the United Kingdom, the race was simulcast on Sky Sports Arena, and later on Sky Sports F1 following the conclusion of the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix. Both Sky Sports broadcasts ran uninterrupted from commercials, switching to a local presenting team during US commercial breaks, while keeping the same video feed. Leading the local presenting team was freelance commentator and broadcaster Tom Gaymor, alongside Mark Blundell and former Indianapolis 500 driver Simona de Silvestro as analysts. \nRadio.\nThe race was broadcast on radio by the Indianapolis Motor Speedway Radio Network. The chief announcer or \"Voice of the 500\" for the eighth consecutive year was Mark Jaynes with Davey Hamilton as driver analyst."

        "text": "The 1999 UST Growling Tigers men's basketball team represented University of Santo Tomas in the 62nd season of the University Athletic Association of the Philippines. The men's basketball tournament for the school year 1999–2000 began on July 10, 1999, and the host school for the season was the University of the Philippines.\nThe Tigers made it back to the Finals for the first time since winning the championship in 1996 after finishing the double round-robin eliminations at joint first place with the De La Salle Green Archers with 11 wins against 3 losses. UST went undefeated in their first ten games for their best start since the 1994 season, when they compiled a 17–0 record that stretched back from their undefeated 1993 campaign. Their ten-game winning streak was snapped by the UE Red Warriors in the second round of eliminations after the Warriors converted a three-point basket to break their 71–all tie in the dying seconds of the game.\nTheir second-round game against the Ateneo Blue Eagles at the Cuneta Astrodome was marred by a melee after the referees failed to control the players' physicality, prompting game officials to reset the remaining last quarter a week later. The game was played behind closed doors at the Lyceum Gym, where the Tigers lost, 60–63.\nThe Tigers lost the playoff for the #1 seed, even as the Green Archers missed the services of Don Allado and Dino Aldeguer, who both got stranded in traffic on their way to the game venue. UST met the third-seeded Blue Eagles in the Final Four and won, 75–74.\nThe best-of-three Finals series was extended to a third and deciding game with the Tigers winning Game 1, after the Archers' Aldeguer missed his three-point shot to preserve UST's 62–60 lead; and with La Salle taking Game 2 as the Archers' Mac Cuan towed his team to an 81–74 win with his clutch free throws. Game 3 went into overtime with La Salle winning, 78–75.\nThird-year forward Marvin Ortiguerra was selected to the Mythical team at the tournament's presentation of awards.\nRoster.\nFollowing the amendment of 33 league rules by the UAAP board, 16 players are now allowed in the lineup per team from the previous limit of 14.\nRoster changes.\nFour players from the 1996 champion team have departed, as Dale Singson, Richard Yee, Gerard Francisco, and Lonlon Talaga have already graduated, leaving senior point guard Gelo Velasco the remaining Tiger with a championship experience.\nVelasco will be joined by former UST Tiger Cub Alwyn Espiritu and former Mapua Red Robin Derick Hubalde, both coming off as the 1998 Most Valuable Player awardees in their respective leagues, as well as the duo of two other former high school MVPs in Marvin Ortiguerra and Emmerson Oreta, and the high-flying tandem of Cyrus Baguio and Niño Gelig.\nSchedule and results.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format. All games were aired on PTV 4 by Silverstar Sports.\nSummary.\nThe best-of-three Finals series was extended to a third and deciding game, with both teams taking one game apiece. In the deciding third game, the Tigers began an 8-0 run before La Salle's Renren Ritualo scored a jumper, five minutes after tip-off. Three more successive baskets by the Archers tied the score, followed by a series of misses and turnovers by both teams. The Archers' Dino Aldeguer next scored a three-point play for a 9-4 La Salle count, with UST still leading, 17-15. La Salle's Willy Wilson then scored his own three-point play to pull his team ahead, 18-17.\nUST at this juncture went on a series of missed jump shots, which prompted head coach Aric del Rosario to point out to his team how they were more effective in scoring from under the basket. Statistics would back-up Del Rosario's claim, as they lead over the Archers in inside point production for the first half, 34-18.\nThe Tigers yielded their biggest deficit at the half when Niño Gelig missed a three-point attempt and a rebound by the Archers' Mac Cuan resulted to a Ritualo fast break, scoring on a two-handed bank shot as he eluded two UST defenders for a six-point La Salle lead. Two successive undergoal stabs by Marvin Ortiguerra pulled the Tigers to within two at 38-40. Ritualo then fired a three with 45 seconds remaining at the half, and was countered by Ortiguerra's basket, as he forced the goal from a near-botched play for a 40-43 count. Wilson next missed his shot which was rebounded by UST as the first half buzzer sounded.\nCyrus Baguio began the second half with a break away two-handed slam. UST tied the score after Baguio converted both free throws off a Francis Zamora foul. Two consecutive three-point shots by Derick Hubalde pulled UST to a ten-point lead at 63-53, with five minutes left in the game. The Archers went on an 9-1 run before a two-minute scoring drought between the two teams, UST still leading at 64-62. Gilbert Lao was fouled by Wilson while the two were trying to grab a missed La Salle shot, at the 1:42 mark. Lao split his free throws for a 65-62 Tigers lead. Aldeguer next converted on a jumper to trail UST by one point.\nGelig was then fouled by Ritualo while attempting a putback, with 44.6 seconds remauning. He missed the first and converted the second free throw for a 66-64 count. La Salle's Allado missed at the post and a jump ball was called at the rebound, with 29.2 seconds left. Baguio and La Salle's Mon Jose contested the tip-off, which was tapped to Ritualo, who missed a ten-foot jump shot from the left flank. Allado missed once again, this time on a putback attempt, with Lao collaring the rebound. He was fouled by Allado at the 19.5-second mark. He missed the first free throw and the second shot circled twice around the rim before falling in. Allado quickly inbouded the ball to Aldeguer, who in turn made a dash to the front court and passed to Ritualo who was being double-teamed by UST. He tried to dribble to the right corner of the three-point arc, but could not elude his two defenders. He kicked out to Allado, who drew another double-team from the Tigers' Gelig, who had run and left Aldeguer open. Aldeguer got the pass from Allado and immediately threw the shot from beyond the arc and converted while also getting fouled by Gelig, 2.7 seconds left in the clock. The score was tied at 67–all, as Aldeguer took his bonus shot but missed. He was able to rebound his own miss but threw an air ball as time expired.\nThe overtime tip-off was won by Zamora, who quickly passed to a sprinting Aldeguer for a two-point basket. A steal off Velasco set off another fast break by La Salle, with Ritualo passing to Aldeguer again for another basket. Velasco dribbled the ball slowly to UST's front court, but suddenly pulled up to release a three-point shot in front of Aldeguer for a 70–71 count. Allado was partially blocked by Ortiguerra and a Baseball pass to Gelig pulled UST ahead, 72–71. An errant pass by Jose to Allado was intercepted by Gelig, but Ortiguerra missed his looper which was contested by Allado. Aldeguer got the rebound and Ritualo was able to weave through UST's defense for a layup. A driving Hubalde drop-passed to an open Lao, but missed his shot, point-blank. The Archers committed two fouls in succession, one called on Allado during the rebound, and another on Wilson, who had tried to stop Ortiguerra in the ensuing post up play. Ortiguerra split his free throws to tie the score at 73–all. Lao then stole off Jose from under La Salle's basket and Ortiguerra was fouled again, with Aldeguer committing his last foul. Two converted free throws sent UST ahead momentarily, as Allado equalized on their next possession. Velasco missed a contested double-pump as Wilson collared the rebound. Ritualo drove and threw an awkward shot to send La Salle to a 77–75 lead, 29.5 seconds remaining.\nCoach Aric called for timeout as Dong Vergeire drew the play for their offense. Velasco, who received the inbound pass from the backcourt, dribbled all the way to the basket, but missed an off-balanced shot. Lao was called for his fifth foul as he tried to flag the dribbling Cuan to stop the clock at 11.6 seconds. Cuan split his charities, missing the first and then converting the second. Velasco missed his three-point shot attempt as the buzzer sounded, yielding a 75–78 loss and the championship to La Salle.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nGelo Velasco was picked 13th overall in the 2000 PBA draft by the Eric Altamirano-led Mobiline Phone Pals on January 9, 2000."

        "title": "2006–07 Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2006–07 Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey season was the 65th season of play for the program and 26th in the CCHA. They represented Michigan State University in the 2006–07 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. They were coached by Rick Comley, in his 5th season and played their home games at Munn Ice Arena. The team won the 2007 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, the 3rd title in program history.\nSeason.\nRegular season.\nEntering the season, Michigan State was ranked in the top 5, coming off of their best postseason performance in years. While the team had lost several players to graduation, they received great contributions from a cadre of sophomore players. While the line formed by Justin Abdelkader, Tim Crowder and Tim Kennedy proved to be a potent combination, it was in goal where Bryan Lerg proved to be just as, if not more, integral to the fortunes of the Spartans.\nMSU had a mediocre start to the season, sometimes living up to their ranking an other times not. Much of this was a result of Lerg's inconsistent play, however, with only freshman Bobby Jarosz as a backup, Rick Comley decided to let his starting goalie play through the struggles. By Thanksgiving, MSU had a decent record and had performed well against other ranked teams. The College Hockey Showcase put the Spartans on the road against two strong WCHA clubs. They lost the first game against #1 Minnesota and then fell in the second game to defending national champion, Wisconsin. Though their ranking wasn't harmed too badly by the sweep, the Spartans were now sitting at .500 and could ill-afford many more like performances if they wanted to keep their NCAA hopes alive.\nThe team finished out the next few weeks with a winning mark, though hardly looked like world-beaters against a pair of weak conference opponents. After returning from the winter break, however, The Spartans looked like a renewed team. They kicked off the second half of their season by capturing the Great Lakes Invitational, which included downing hated rival Michigan in the championship. After splitting with a top-ranked Miami squad, The Spartans didn't lose for over a month. That stretch of good hockey helped raise the team up to #6 in the polls and put them in a prime position for the tournament. Unfortunately, the team's offense faltered at the end of the regular season and MSU dropped four of their last five games.\nPostseason.\nMSU entered the CCHA tournament ranked #13 and could not afford a poor performance if they intended to be one of the 16 teams in the national tournament. Fortunately, the offense rediscovered their scoring touch and posted a pair of 4–2 wins over Nebraska–Omaha to reach the semifinal. While they lost the next game to Michigan, the sixth meeting of the two on the season, the Spartans retained their #10 ranking and received an at-large bid.\nThe selection committee gave Michigan State a #3 seed and sent them to Grand Rapids. They took on Boston University in the first game and had one of their best performances on the season, putting up 5 goals against one of the nations' best defensive teams. The second game would be an even bigger test, however, as MSU had to get through the second overall seed, Notre Dame. The Irish had the nation's best defense and had allowed less than 2 goals per game thanks to the NCAA's top goaltender, David Brown. Unsurprisingly, the game was a defensive struggle with both teams waiting for the other to make a mistake. Both squads had several opportunities on the power play but it was Michigan State who took advantage. The Spartans opened the scoring in the second on a goal from Chris Mueller. MSU remained dominant in the second even after taking a pair of minor penalties and limited the Irish to just 3 shots in the frame. Tim Kennedy added a man-advantage marker of his own in the third to give his team a 2-goal edge. Notre Dame fought back and finally beat Lerg with over 5 minutes to play but they could not find the equalizer and Michigan State held on for a narrow victory.\nBy the time they reached the national semifinal, Michigan State saw a far less daunting task in front of them. All four #1 seeds had already been eliminated. Despite the favorable conditions, MSU got off to a terrible start against Maine by surrendering 3 goals in the first three and a half minutes of the match. Jeff Lerg brushed off the two markers and refused to allow any more to the Black Bears. Over the final 56 minutes of the game, Michigan State outscored Maine 4–0 with goals coming from across their lineup. The victory sent Michigan State to their first title game in 20 years.\nWhen the Spartans opened against Boston College, it appeared like they were going to be run over by the Eagles. BC carried the play throughout the first period, outshooting MSU 13–6, but neither team managed to score. The second saw a reversal with Michigan State doubling up BC in shots, however, Brian Boyle was the only one to find the back of the net. To make matters worse, MSU squandered three successive BC penalties that game them nearly 6 consecutive minutes on the power play. With the team growing increasingly desperate for a goal, Michigan State finally converted on their 5th man-advantage of the game when Kennedy skated in on a partial break-away and fired the puck past Cory Schneider. Both goaltenders played well over the following 10 minutes to keep the score knotted at 1 and the game appeared to be heading for overtime. With about 30 seconds to play, Justin Abdelkader skated in on a 3-on-1 and fired a puck off of the crossbar. Rather than deflect out of play, the puck hit the wall and remained live. Several players fought to get control along the boards and the rubber ended up on the stick of Kennedy behind the net. He wheeled around to avoid a check and then found Abdelkader skating towards the goal mouth. Abdelkader slapped the puck far-side, beating Schneider for his only goal of the tournament. With just 19 seconds left on the clock, BC had little choice but to pull their goalie before the drop of the puck. All that served to do, however, was give Chris Mueller an empty net to shoot at and make the final score 3–1.\nMSU was one of the least likely champions in NCAA history. Illustrating that point is the lack of awards and honors received by the Spartans. Other than Jeff Lerg, who received the Perani Cup, not a single MSU player won an award, was an All-American or was even on an All-Conference player. Additionally, Michigan State had the fewest wins and lowest winning percentage of any champion since Minnesota in 1974.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "The 2022 Breeders' Cup Challenge series was a series of horse races that provided the respective winners with an automatic \"Win and You're In\" berth in the 2022 Breeders' Cup, held on November 4 and 5. Races were chosen by the Breeders' Cup organization and included key races in the various Breeders' Cup divisions from around the world. The Breeders' Cup organization paid the Breeders' Cup entry fee for the challenge race winners, provided they had been nominated as foals. They also provided travel allowances for out of state competitors\nSummary.\nThe 2022 Breeders' Cup Challenge series consisted of 82 races from across the United States and 10 other countries, compared to 84 races in the 2021 series. The Breeders' Cup committee restructured the series to ensure there were qualifying races in the east, midwest and west of the United States for most of the divisions, plus international qualifiers mainly for the turf races. The following races were added: Grande Prêmio Brasil (Turf - International region), Beverly D. (Filly &amp; Mare Turf - Midwest), Green Flash (Turf Sprint - West region), Miss Grillo (Juvenile Fillies - East region), Ack Ack (Dirt Mile - Midwest region) and Pilgrim (Juvenile Turf - East). The Fleur de Lis, Suburban, John Nerud, Personal Ensign, Iroquois, Pocohantas, Jockey Club Derby, Santa Anita Sprint Championship, Zenyatta and First Lady were removed from the series. The King's Stand Stakes replaced the Diamond Jubilee Stakes as an international qualifier for the Turf Sprint.\nNBC broadcast many of the North American challenge races, either on the main network or CNBC, with other races webcast on the Peacock.\nUp to 14 horses are eligible for each Breeders' Cup race (12 for the Juvenile Turf Sprint and Dirt Mile). If a race is over-subscribed, first preference is given to winners of the Challenge series races. On October 26, 205 horses were pre-entered for the Breeders' Cup, 46 of which qualified via the Challenge series. The following fields were over-subscribed: Juvenile Turf Sprint, Juvenile Fillies, Juvenile Fillies Turf, Juvenile Turf, Filly &amp; Mare Sprint, Turf Sprint, Dirt Mile, Filly &amp; Mare Turf, Sprint, Mile and Turf.\nSeven challenge race winners went on to win at the Breeders' Cup:\nChallenge Series races.\nThe following table shows the Breeders' Cup Challenge races for 2022 and respective winners. The \"status\" column shows whether the Challenge race winner was entered at the Breeders' Cup, and if so if they finished in the money."

        "text": "The 2004–05 Denver Pioneers men's ice hockey season was the 56th season of play for the program and 46th in the WCHA. The Pioneers represented the University of Denver in the 2004–05 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at Magness Arena and were coached by George Gwozdecky, in his 11th season. The team won the 2005 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, the 7th title in program history.\nSeason.\nDenver began the defense of its first national championship in 35 years ranked #7 in the pre-season polls. While it was a fairly high ranking, the loss of several key players left the Pioneers with some work to do. The first question was who would replace Adam Berkhoel as the starter in goal. Coach George Gwozdecky had called him the 'best goaltender in the country' the previous year and finding his successor would be critical for the program's chances. While Edmonton draft pick Glenn Fisher had the inside track as a sophomore, training camp ended with Denver alternating between Fisher and Peter Mannino in goal.\nEarly results were mixed and the Pioneers got off to a sluggish start. After 10 games they sat at .500 but had faced a murderer's row of opponents. Seven of those games had come against top-6 opponents, including three consecutive weeks where Denver earned splits. Though the there were excuses as to why the Pios weren't at their top form, defeating tough competition was exactly what the team would need to do if they hoped to retain their status as champions. The defense, now led by team captain Matt Laatsch, found its consistency in November and helped the team reel off several consecutive victories. As Denver climbed towards the top of the conference standings, they similarly rose in the polls, climbing back into the top-10.\nDuring the winter break, Denver's defense faltered a bit against Minnesota–Duluth. Fortunately, the offense had remained a strong suit for the team. The addition of Paul Stastny helped buoy the offense, led by Gabe Gauthier and Matt Carle.\nAfter capturing the Denver Cup, the Pioneers dropped a stunner to bottom-feeding Michigan Tech. The sizable upset appeared to help refocus the team and sent Denver on another long undefeated streak. The loss to the Huskies ended up being the only defeat the Pioneers suffered over a 20-game stretch. With the platooning of Fisher and Mannino paying dividends in the win column, Denver shot to the top of the standings and earned the #1 ranking by mid-February. The Pioneers saw their streak end against Duluth but then lost the next game to Minnesota State–Mankato and fell to #3. While their ranking wasn't too consequential by then, as they had all but guaranteed themselves a spot in the NCAA tournament, the losses put Denver into a tie with Colorado College for the conference lead. With the two meeting for the regular season finale, Denver had to win the weekend to capture the MacNaughton Cup. Unfortunately, they were shutout by the Tigers in the first game, leaving the team only able to tie for the league crown. A complementary blanking from Mannino helped them do just that and the two long-time rivals were forced to share the regular season title.\nConference Tournament.\nThough Denver and Colorado College were tied with identical records, the Pioneers held the tiebreaker and received the #1 seed for the WCHA tournament. The team utterly dominated Michigan Tech in the first game but they were pushed hard in the rematch. Despite firing 46 shots on goal, only one got past Cam Ellsworth. Fortunately, Mannino stopped everything that came his way and the team advanced to the conference semifinals.\nThey met long-time rival North Dakota at the Xcel Energy Center and the two battled through a defensive struggle. Both teams were only able to score a single goal in regulation thanks to their respective power plays. With 60 minutes not enough to settle the score, the two prepared for overtime. While the match was set up to go long into the night, Gauthier ended the match on the first shot of the extra session. In the championship, only Colorado College stood in the Pioneers' way Denver had another defensive struggle on its hands. Despite possessing the #2 offense in the country, the Pioneers could only muster a single goal, again on the power play. Mannino, however, posted his 5th shutout of the season and allowed Luke Fulghum's marker to stand as the game-winner.\nNCAA Tournament.\nDenver sat atop both polls at the end of the season. In spite of this, however, they received the #2 overall seed in the tournament. To make matters worse, Minnesota was the host for the West Regional and, since the Gophers were also a #1 seed, Denver was slotted to open in Amherst, Massachusetts.\nThe Pioneers' faced CHA tournament champion Bemidji State in the Beavers' first Division I tournament game. While Denver was expected to roll over the unranked BSU squad, the Pios found themselves trailing twice early in the game. Bemidji State fought hard and never let Denver put any distance between the two. Despite being outshout 45–22, the Beavers equaled the Pios with 3 goals in regulation and sent the game into overtime. Denver controlled the play for much of the later portion of the game and they continued into the extra frame. After three and a half minutes the Pios had 5 shots to Bemidji's 1, the last of which found its way into the goal and prevented a stunning upset. The second game for the Pioneers went a little bit smoother. After trading 1-goal leads with New Hampshire, a strong third period allowed the Pioneers to pull away from the Wildcats. The game was capped off by a hat-trick from Gauthier in the waning seconds.\nIn the Frozen Four, Denver found three of its conference rivals waiting for them. This marked the first time in history, in any sport, that all four teams reaching the National Semifinals all came from the same conference.\nAs a consequence of Fisher's struggles against Bemidji State and Peter Mannino stronger performance over the course of the entire season, Gwozdecky ended the goaltender rotation and went with his best option in goal. He needn't have worried, however, as Denver trounced Colorado College in the semifinal. The Pioneers outshout the Tigers 43–29 and, more importantly, outscored their in-state rivals 6–2. Most stunning was the fact that all 8 goals in the game were scored on the power play, setting an NCAA tournament record.\nFor the chance to repeat as national champions, Denver faced an old foe in North Dakota. The two had med three times prior for the national title with the most recent coming in 1968. Jeff Drummond opened the scoring early in the first but Denver's lead was erased just a few minutes later on a power play marker from Travis Zajac. The score remained even until just past the midway point of the game when Stastny added a goal on the man-advantage. It took another 18 minutes for the next goal but it was again Stastny on the power play. Despite a furious assault by North Dakota in the third, Denver's lead held and the game was salted away by Gabe Gauthier's 26 goal of the season into an empty net.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | \n!colspan=12 style=\"color:white; background:#862633; \" | "

The Yellow Jackets represented American International College and were coached by Eric Lang, in his 1st season.\nSeason.\nAIC began the season with a new coach for the first time in 32 years. Eric Lang, an alumnus, replaced Gary Wright behind the bench. The chance in leadership presaged a tone for the program and led to nice players leaving the team early. While all the roster spots were filled, the sizable roster turnover did no favors for the Yellow Jackets in terms of wins. In the first half of the season, American International won just 3 out of 18 games and were stuck in a familiar position; the bottom of the Atlantic Hockey standings.\nWhile the team failed to win many games, they did fight hard and pushed several opponents into overtime. By the end of November the Yellow Jackets had more ties than losses and a great deal of credit could be attributed to the surprising defensive effort from the squad. The goaltending tandem of Alex Murray and Zackarias Skog combined to keep AIC in many games where they were otherwise outplayed and gave some hope that the team might be able to climb out of the conference cellar.\nIn the second half of the year the Yellow Jackets saw a moderate increase to their win total but the defense slipped. Murray struggled mightily as the season wore on and won just 1 of his 7 decisions. Since the revamped offense was little help, the bulk of the team's victories came on the shoulders of Skog, who posted a winning record after new year's. AIC finished 10th in the conference and, though their first round opponent was hardly formidable, the Yellow Jackets were unable to overcome Mercyhurst and were swept out of the postseason.\nA disappointing finish was hardly a new state of affairs for the program, however, AIC had seen some signs of life during the season. Importantly, many of the new additions had played significant rolls in the team's limitded success. Not only had Skog established himself as the starting goaltender, but the top four scorers on the team were all freshmen.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The championship featured a mix of professional and amateur drivers, competing in Formula Regional cars that conform to the FIA Formula Regional regulations for the championship. This was the fifth season of the championship and the third after a merger with Formula Renault Eurocup which resulted to the change of the engine supplier to Alpine.\nAndrea Kimi Antonelli, driving for Prema Racing, won the Drivers' Championship with two races to spare. His team clinched the Teams' Championship at the final race by only two points. Martinius Stenshorne, driving for R-ace GP, won the Rookie Championship.\nThe season was marred by the death of Dutch driver Dilano van 't Hoff during the second race of the Spa-Francorchamps round.\nTeams and drivers.\nTwelve teams were pre-selected by the championship organizers on 2 December 2022.\nTeam changes.\nFA Racing by MP announced their departure from the championship in October 2022. The entry was taken over by French team Saintéloc Racing.\nDriver changes.\nReigning team champions Prema Racing renewed their line-up completely, as all their 2022 full-time drivers were promoted to Formula 3, with champion Dino Beganovic and Paul Aron staying with the Italian team and Sebastian Montoya joining Hitech Pulse-Eight. Replacing them were the 2022 Italian F4 and ADAC F4 champion Andrea Kimi Antonelli, Rafael Câmara and third-year FRECA driver Lorenzo Fluxá. All three raced for Prema's partner team Mumbai Falcons in the 2023 Formula Regional Middle East Championship, with Antonelli taking the title.\nVice-champion team R-ace GP recruited Tim Tramnitz, who departed Trident after coming 15th with the team in his debut season. He replaced Lorenzo Fluxá, who joined Prema Racing. The team signed another second-year driver in Matías Zagazeta, who failed to score points in his rookie year with G4 Racing, to replace Gabriel Bortoleto, who graduated to F3 with Trident. Their lineup was completed by Martinius Stenshorne, who made appearances in four different Formula 4 series in 2022, with a seventh in the Italian Championship as his best result.\n2022 Formula 4 UAE and 2023 Formula Regional Oceania champion Charlie Wurz joined ART Grand Prix, replacing Gabriele Minì, who graduated to FIA Formula 3 with Hitech Pulse-Eight. The team also signed Sauber Academy driver Marcus Amand, who graduated from Formula 4, to replace Esteban Masson.\nVan Amersfoort Racing replaced Arden-bound Levente Révész with Niels Koolen, who also competed with the team in the 2023 Formula Regional Middle East Championship.\nTrident recruited Owen Tangavelou, who raced with G4 Racing and Race Performance Motorsport in 2022, finishing 20th in the championship. He replaced Leonardo Fornaroli, who graduated to the Italian outfit's Formula 3 team after winning the rookie title in 2022. Nikhil Bohra replaced Tim Tramnitz to complete Trident's line-up after a successful Formula Regional debut in the 2023 Formula Regional Middle East Championship, where he finished 9th overall.\nMP Motorsport signed Victor Bernier, who started his second season in the championship after a 17th-place finish in the 2022 season driving for MP's former partner team FA Racing.\nLevente Révész made the switch from Van Amersfoort Racing to Arden for his second FRECA season, replacing Noel León, who moved across to the Euroformula Open championship. Arden's driver roster was completed by Tom Lebbon, 2020 Ginetta Junior champion and third in GB3 in 2022, who replaced Dudu Barrichello.\nRPM promoted Irish driver Adam Fitzgerald from the F4 British Championship to replace the Trident-bound Owen Tangavelou. Santiago Ramos, who joined the team for the final round in 2022, raced there on a full-time basis in 2023. The teams' lineup was completed by Macéo Capietto, who moved over from Monolite Racing after a 22nd place in his rookie season. He replaced fellow Frenchman Pierre-Louis Chovet, who moved over to GT3 racing after three years in Formula Regional.\nMonolite Racing fielded Giovanni Maschio, who graduated from the Italian F4 Championship, having also taken part in the 2023 Formula Regional Middle East Championship. Partnering him was Enzo Scionti, who last drove for Drivex in the 2021 Euroformula Open Championship where he came 14th.\n2022 French F4 champion Alessandro Giusti made his Formula Regional debut in 2023, joining G4 Racing to replace Zagazeta. Partnering him and returning to the team was Michael Belov, who finished 7th in 2022 despite only completing half the season with MP Motorsport.\nKIC Motorsport fielded an all-new, all-rookie line-up in 2023. Ferrari Academy driver Maya Weug jumped up to the Formula Regional level after two years in the Italian F4 Championship, replacing Santiago Ramos, who moved to RPM. Piotr Wiśnicki, who graduated to F3, was replaced by Ultimate Cup Series race winner Shannon Lugassy. The seat of Sebastian Ogaard, who moved to the newly created Eurocup-3 series, was originally to be filled by Formula Academy Finland race-winner Iker Oikarinen, before he was replaced by F4 racer Olexander Partyshev.\nNew entrant Saintéloc Racing signed Emerson Fittipaldi Jr., who made the step up to Formula Regional in 2023. Partnering him was Lucas Medina, a race winner in NACAM F4.\nMid-season changes.\nKirill Smal joined Monolite Racing after the first round for a part-time campaign that lasted until round six, after making his Formula Regional Debut in the final three rounds of the inaugural Middle Eastern championship.\nEsteban Masson joined Saintéloc Racing from round three onwards, except for the rounds at Mugello and Zandvoort. The French driver competed for FA Racing by MP and ART Grand Prix in 2022, scoring a single point. His main campaign in 2023 was the Eurocup-3 championship, where he drove for Campos Racing.\nART Grand Prix's Charlie Wurz was ruled out from competing in round four at Spa as he contracted laryngitis. At the same event, the team welcomed guest driver Hadrien David, who came fourth in 2022 with R-ace GP. Charlie Wurz returned to the championship from round five onwards.\nAfter Dilano van 't Hoff lost his life in a crash during the second race at Spa, his team MP Motorsport did not enter any of their cars for the following round at Mugello. RPM driver Adam Fitzgerald, who suffered multiple broken bones in the accident, was also absent from round 5 onwards. At KIC Motorsport, Oleksandr Partyshev missed the round and was replaced by Konsta Lappalainen, who last competed in the series in 2021 and has been driving GT cars since.\nFollowing KIC Motorsport's Oleksandr Partyshev's absence for the round at Mugello, he announced his retirement from racing, citing one of the main reasons to be due to Dilano van 't Hoff's death. His seat, filled by Lappalainen for round five, was filled by Ivan Klymenko, who therefore ended his TTE Formula Renault Cup campaign, for the remainder of the season.\nAhead of the round at Paul Ricard, G4 Racing announced that they would field a third car from that event on for French F4 driver Pierre-Alexandre Provost.\nCharlie Wurz and Joshua Dufek, driving for ART Grand Prix and Van Amersfoort Racing respectively, switched to the Euroformula Open prior to round seven at the Red Bull Ring, where both series coincided. Jesse Carrasquedo Jr., stepping up from Spanish F4, replaced Dufek at VAR. Kirill Smal was absent from Monolite Racing, with Hadrien David rejoining the series to replace him.

Saintéloc Racing meanwhile only fielded two cars as Lucas Medina was absent. Shortly before the race weekend, Enzo Scionti announced his withdrawal from the round as he was recovering from a road accident.\nPrior to the round at Monza, Saintéloc Racing announced that GB3 driver Tymek Kucharczyk would join the team for round eight. RPM also announced a new driver, with Spanish F4 driver Noah Strømsted joining the team for the round to make his debut.\nFive drivers were announced to be making their series debut at the penultimate round: Francisco Soldavini for G4 Racing (replacing Michael Belov), Ivan Domingues for Van Amersfoort Racing (replacing Jesse Carrasquedo Jr.), newly crowned French F4 champion Evan Giltaire for ART Grand Prix (occupying the car previously driven by Charlie Wurz), Eurocup-3 driver Javier Sagrera for MP Motorsport (using Bruno del Pino's car) and F3 driver Nikita Bedrin at Monolite Racing to replace Hadrien David. Saintéloc Racing was another team that changed its lineup as it brought in Lamborghini junior and experienced Formula Regional driver Pierre-Louis Chovet in place of Esteban Masson. Levente Révész and William Karlsson left Arden and KIC Motorsport, but were not replaced.\nAhead of the season finale, Monolite Racing announced that Formula 4 driver Valentin Kluss would make his series debut, driving the car previously piloted by Smal, David and Bedrin. The latter meanwhile moved to Van Amersfoort Racing to replace Niels Koolen. Strømsted returned to RPM ahead of his 2024 campaign with the team.\nRace calendar.\nThe calendar was revealed on 2 December 2022. Three pre-season tests were held at Barcelona, Paul Ricard and Monza in March and April. The championship visited Germany for the first time in its history, but did not support Formula One unlike in the years before.\nSeason report.\nFirst half.\nThe 2023 Formula Regional European Championship opened at Imola with R-ace GP's Martinius Stenshorne on pole position for the first race. He remained largely unbothered by three Prema cars running right on his tail, and managed the race through two safety car periods, up until a red flag for a crash between RPM's Adam Fitzgerald and Saintéloc's Lucas Medina ended the race early. The podium was completed by Prema pair Andrea Kimi Antonelli and Rafael Câmara. R-ace GP's Tim Tramnitz was on pole position for race two, while Fitzgerald had to withdraw after sustaining a back injury. VAR's Kas Haverkort overtook Tramnitz at the start, before two safety car periods interrupted the race. Stenshorne took second place on the restart afterwards, sending Tramnitz into the wall in the process and prompting another caution. One more incident brought the total number of retirements to nine and allowed Haverkort a comfortable win. Stenshorne in second claimed the championship lead, while Trident's Nikhil Bohra came third.\nAntonelli and Tramnitz shared pole positions for the two races at Barcelona. The German started second for the first race and moved into the lead at the start. Haverkort slotted into third, before a red flag was thrown for a crash between MP Motorsport teammates Sami Meguetounif and Dilano van 't Hoff. The top three remained stable through the restart. Antonelli began attacking Tramnitz on lap twelve, but Tramnitz defended, before another safety car interruption ended the race under caution. Race two saw much of the same, with Tramnitz keeping the lead at the start and again leading Antonelli all race. Like the day before, Antonelli tried pressuring Tramnitz into a mistake, but to no avail. The two gapped the field, while behind them Meguetounif claimed third to bounce back from his retirement the day before. Tramnitz' double win allowed him to claim the championship lead by four points over Antonelli, while Stenshorne had a difficult weekend and dropped to fourth.\nThe Hungaroring brought Stenshorne back to the front with a pole position for race one. Antonelli drew alongside him at the start to take the lead. He kept it through a safety car period, before making a mistake and running off the track to allow Stenshorne back in front and give up the podium to Haverkort and RPM's Santiago Ramos. The Norwegian gratefully accepted the opportunity and took the win. VAR's Joshua Dufek claimed pole position for the second race, but it was a short-lived first place. Stenshorne had taken the lead by turn two, and Prema's Lorenzo Fluxá also went past the Swiss driver. Stenshorne managed his lead through three safety car interruptions, not allowing Fluxá any opportunity to attack him. He took the win to sweep the weekend and claim back the championship lead, now 29 points ahead of Antonelli, while this time it was Tramnitz' turn to have an off weekend and drop down to fourth. RPM's Macéo Capietto completed the podium after passing Dufek in the final part of the race.\nCâmara and Tramnitz shared pole positions for the round at Spa. The latter attacked the former for the lead at the start of race one, but found no way past. This repeated itself at a safety car restart later on, but the outcome was no different. Stenshorne had a quiet race to finish third. The second race was held in wet conditions. Tramnitz held the lead at the start, while Antonelli moved into second past Ramos. The Italian took the lead on lap six and kept it through a safety car period. Tramnitz then spun around on the penultimate lap, but had his second place ahead of Arden's Joshua Dürksen reinstated when red flags flew shortly after and the race ended prematurely. Antonelli took his maiden win and shortened the points gap to five points, but it was not a day to celebrate: the multi-car crash that had caused the stoppage saw Fitzgerald collide with van 't Hoff's stricken car at the Kemmel Straight. This accident resulted in Fitzgerald breaking multiple bones and claimed the life of van 't Hoff.\nTeams and drivers had little time to process what happened, as the round at Mugello happened only a week later. MP Motorsport and multiple other drivers did not enter the weekend. Stenshorne took pole position for the first race. Antonelli attacked him at the start, but could not get past, allowing the Norwegian to control the race. A restart with eight minutes remaining after Dürksen and Monolite's Kirill Smal came together gave another opportunity to Antonelli, but Stenshorne prevailed to lead the Italian and Tramnitz home. The second race saw Antonelli lead from pole position, before he had to contend with a safety car restart early on. Stenshorne moved into third before the interruption, behind Câmara, who was unable to attack Antonelli. Two more caution periods saw the top three positions remain unchanged. Ramos attacked Stenshorne on the final lap, leading to the pair crashing hard into the pitwall while crossing the finish line. The championship closed up even more, with Stenshorne now only two points ahead of Antonelli.\nSecond half.\nThe second half of the championship began at Paul Ricard with a surprise home pole position for G4's Alessandro Giusti. Meguetounif moved into second past Stenshorne at the start, before the safety car was called. Tramnitz attacked Stenshorne heavily on the restart, but found no way past him onto the podium. Giusti in front was free to control his gap to the field as he took his maiden win unchallenged from behind. Antonelli could only manage fifth, but bounced back the next day to claim pole position for race two. He had a clean start, while Haverkort next to him bogged down to allow Saintéloc's part-timer Esteban Masson and Tramnitz through. Battles raged all through the field, but the situation at the top was stable. Antonelli managed the gap while Masson managed his tyres. Tramnitz closed up to Masson on the final lap and the pair battled through multiple corners, but Masson prevailed to keep second place. Antonelli's win handed him the championship lead by six points going into the summer break.\nTeams and drivers then headed to Spielberg, where Câmara took pole position for the first race. He kept the lead at the start and was able to control the race from then onwards. Behind him, Tramnitz and Giusti fought over second place, with the Frenchman eventually coming out in front. He then closed up to Câmara and gapped the German, who came under pressure from Antonelli. But neither Antonelli nor Giusti could make a move, so the positions were unchanged at the finish line. Giusti then continued his run of form by taking pole position for race two. He resisted Antonelli at the start, before the latter was overtaken by Meguetounif. Giusti held on to win the race on his birthday. Antonelli dropped further down behind Stenshorne and finished fourth, before the Norwegian earned himself a post-race penalty for a starting procedure infringement. That lifted Antonelli back up to the podium and completed a pointless weekend to forget for Stenshorne who was now 33 points behind championship leader Antonelli.\nRound eight of the season took place at Monza, and Câmara once again opened up the weekend with a pole position. ART's Marcus Amand took the lead at the start of the first race, while Antonelli battled past Câmara to second place and two laps later claimed the race lead. The pair held the top spots through three restarts, while Giusti took third. After the race, both Antonelli and Amand were penalized, handing the win to Giusti and allowing Stenshorne and MP's Victor Bernier onto the podium. Antonelli bounced back by taking pole position for the second race. He kept the lead at the start, while Câmara worked his way up from starting fourth to eventually end up second. He attacked Antonelli for two laps before a red flag was thrown for an incident between G4's Pierre-Alexandre Provost and Arden's Tom Lebbon. The race was not restarted, allowing Antonelli to hold on to the win, with Tramnitz third. Stenshorne had to retire from the race, losing further ground to Antonelli in the championship, with the Italian's lead now 43 points.\nHaverkort began the penultimate race weekend at Zandvoort with a home pole position. He had a comfortable start as ART's Laurens van Hoepen lost second to Antonelli. The Italian then shadowed Haverkort for the rest of the race, but did not make a move as Haverkort converted his pole position into a home win for him and his team. Stenshorne started fourth and pressured van Hoepen all race, but could not find a way onto the podium. Rain hit the Dutch seaside for Sunday, and Marcus Amand took pole position as he judged the changing weather conditions best. Antonelli needed to outscore Stenshorne by two points to win the championship, and he did so in style: starting in eighth, he utterly dominated the race, claiming the lead after three laps and building a twelve-second gap over Amand despite a red flag mid-race for dangerously wet conditions. Van Hoepen made it two podiums out of two, while Stenshorne finished sixth. He was unable to do anything about Antonelli taking the title, 64 points in the lead.\nThe championship concluded at the Hockenheimring, and Haverkort and Tramnitz shared pole positions. Haverkort lost his lead in race one to Câmara, before both were overtaken by Tramnitz. Stenshorne was also on the move, slotting into third after a safety car. Câmara tried taking the lead in the final part of the race, but Tramnitz' stark defense saw the Brazilian lose ground and concede the podium to Stenshorne and Monolite's guest driver Nikita Bedrin. Tramnitz and Stenshorne were both in contention for second place going into the final race, but Stenshorne made his intentions clear at the start, moving past Tramnitz into the lead. Câmara also moved past Tramnitz, but once again completely lost his momentum when trying to go for the lead. This time it was Haverkort benefitting and getting onto the podium. Antonelli, who ran seventh, overtook Bohra on the final lap to help his Prema team win the Teams' Championship by two points over R-ace GP and end the season 39 points in the lead of the championship.\nAntonelli came into the championship with huge expectations on his shoulders, and he delivered. While Stenshorne in second had the same amount of victories, once again consistency was key: Apart from a mechanical retirement and a penalty, Antonelli always finished in the top six. The Italian dedicated his fourth championship in two years to Dilano van 't Hoff, explaining that the weekend at Spa where the Dutch driver lost his life was a key point for his championship challenge, as he took his first win there and was able to build on that through the rest of the season.\nChampionship standings.\nPoints were awarded to the top 10 classified finishers.\nTeams' standings.\nFor teams entering more than two cars, only the two best-finishing cars were eligible to score points in the teams' championship."

The sport was introduced to Russia even before the 1917 Revolution, but the game was not popular at that time. The country's first tournament took place only in 1923, and it quickly gained popularity among young people. \nSoviet Era.\nDuring the Soviet era, basketball became an important part of the country's sporting culture. The Soviet Union's national basketball team was one of the strongest in the world, and it won several Olympic medals, including gold in 1972, 1988, as well as three FIBA Basketball World Cup in 1967, 1974 and 1982.\nthe Soviet Union dissolution and Present Russia.\nAfter the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, basketball in Russia experienced some ups and downs. The country's economy went through a difficult period, which affected the funding and development of sports programs. However, Russian basketball has rebounded in recent years, with several teams achieving success in European and international competitions.\nToday, Russia has a strong professional basketball league, the VTB United League, which includes teams from Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and other countries. The league has produced several talented players, including Andrei Kirilenko, Sergey Karasev, and Timofey Mozgov, who have gone on to play in the NBA.\n2022 Russia Banned.\nAfter the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIBA banned Russian teams and officials from participating in FIBA basketball and FIBA 3x3 Basketball competitions.

        "title": "Ice hockey in Minnesota",
        "text": "Minnesota, more so than any other state, is the focal point for ice hockey in the United States. Since the late-19th century, the cold, winter weather enabled the land of 10,000 lakes to be a natural home for ice hockey and the residents of the state have invested more time, effort and energy into the game than most other regions in the world.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\n1883 saw the first ice rink built in Saint Paul to host game of ice polo (an early derivation of shinny). The local tournaments were so popular that within a decade, an artificial indoor rink was built to support the series. In 1895, piggybacking on the popularity of ice polo, a championship ice hockey team from Winnipeg travelled south to take on a team made up of students from the University of Minnesota. This is the earliest recorded official game of ice hockey in the state. The following winter, several new teams appeared and a tournament was held in Saint Paul. Former polo player Ed Murphy was a key contributor in driving the transition from polo to hockey. Over the next several years, many amateur teams appeared all over the state as did several indoor rinks. The early adoption of ice hockey in Minnesota didn't appear to catch the attention of outsiders, as most professional leagues ignored Minnesota, but that didn't deter the locals.\nAfter the end of World War I, colleges around the state began to formally support ice hockey programs. The flagship school, Minnesota was the centerpiece for this expansion and the Gophers swiftly became one of the top college teams in the country. The other programs were scattered all over the state from Eveleth to Duluth to St. Cloud and helped to ensure that every region in the state had a local team they could call their own. The college programs were fed by a series of high schools that increased as additional rinks were built in the state. High school hockey had its origins dating back to 1905 but began to see rapid expansion in the 1920s.\nCoinciding with the proliferation of junior and college teams, amateur and professional hockey also took off during the interwar period. The St. Paul Saints, who played their first game before the war, became one of the top amateur clubs in the country and provided four players for the inaugural US national team at the 1920 Olympics. Cyril Weidenborner, Edward Fitzgerald, Moose Goheen and Anthony Conroy were all Minnesota natives and earned silver medals in Antwerp.\nThe Saints would later become a professional team and join the American Hockey Association, the nation's first minor ice hockey league. They were able to form a natural rivalry with the cross-town Minneapolis Millers but professional hockey in Minnesota experienced a few bumps in the road. The great depression forced several teams to cease operations and made many others switch back to amateur hockey, as they could not afford to pay the players. Both Saint Paul and Minneapolis, along with the Eveleth Rangers, left the AHA to found the Central Hockey League during the darkest days of the depression and kept senior hockey alive in the early 1930s. Fortunately, the economic situation improved by the middle of the decade and the CHL was absorbed back into the AHA in 1935.\nPostwar years.\nWhen the United States entered World War II, many leagues and teams across Minnesota suspended operations for the duration. The University of Minnesota was one of the few programs in the country to continue playing during the war. After the end of the war, the proliferation of ice hockey resumed and the first state high school tournament was held. Since the mid-40s, Minnesota high schools have been one of the biggest producers of American ice hockey players and have become a point of pride for the state. While USA Hockey has assumed control of most junior organizations throughout the country, the state's secondary schools have remained staunchly independent and been ranked among the best junior programs in the nation. In 2023, a poll was released, ranking the more than 2,000 high school ice hockey programs in the nation. The top 13 high schools were all from Minnesota, demonstrating just how important Minnesota's high school system is to American ice hockey.\nWith the grassroots of ice hockey well established after the war, Minnesota was producing a great deal of local talent. Unfortunately, at this time there were only 6 NHL teams and there was a de facto ban on American players. From 1945 through 1967 the rosters of NHL teams were made up almost entirely by Canadians. Even the four American clubs, who were run by Canadian managers and coaches, followed this pattern. This effect was also felt in the minor leagues, who largely employed Canadians regardless of their location. With little chance of playing at the highest levels of the sport, Minnesota players had few options to choose from during this time. Many choose to leverage their high school exploits into college scholarships but, there too was a problem. While American colleges had used mostly American players prior to World War II, an arms race of sorts began after the war. Many western colleges began to recruit more of their players from Canada, taking advantage of lax NCAA rules that permitted overage junior players to attend college. Spearheaded by Vic Heyliger at Michigan, college rosters became increasingly Canadian throughout the 1950s with a few glaring exceptions.\n Elwin Romnes, a Minnesota native and former NHL player, took over as head coach at Minnesota in 1947. He rejected the new trend of importing Canadian players and continued to rely upon home-grown talent. After his departure 5 years later, that policy was reinforced by John Mariucci, another former NHLer who had won an intercollegiate title with Minnesota in 1940. Mariucci was a vocal critic of using Canadian players and achieved more notability for his commitment when Minnesota's American roster was able to match and even surpass other schools. In 1953 and 1954, the Gophers finished as the national runners-up thanks in large part to John Mayasich, the best college player at the time. Mayasich had been a star high school player and went on to set numerous records at the college level. He was so well regarded that in 2011, Mayasich was ranked as the best high school player in the history of Minnesota hockey. Despite his exploits, Mayasich didn't receive a single offer from an NHL team. While that was not wholly unexpected, Mayasich would later express regret in an interview with Sports Illustrated.\n\"It wasn't a source of bitterness, since no college players were being given a chance...but there's still regret, even to this day, not knowing if I could have done it.\"\nWhile Mayasich, as well as many other players, couldn't pursue a professional career at the time, they were able to continue playing in other avenues. Mayasich joined the US national team and, because the IOC only permitted amateurs at the time, the lack of professional opportunities helped the national program. With a roster made up of the best players in the country, the United States won a silver medal in ice hockey in 1956 and followed that up with their first gold medal in 1960. Of the 17 players on the roster, 7 were from Minnesota (including Mayasich).\nAfter the AHA failed to return after the war, the teams that had survived the hibernation formed a new circuit called the United States Hockey League. That minor league lasted just 6 years and the revivals of both the Saints and Millers didn't extend beyond the league's end. After several failed attempts with pro hockey, Minnesota turned to senior amateur leagues and saw a good deal of success. The most storied senior team is probably the Warroad Lakers who won many championships in its 50-year history, including three when it was invited to participate in Canada's national senior tournament.\nProfessional opportunities.\nAfter 1960, the NHL began to soften its uncharitable view of US colleges but only towards Canadian players. It wasn't until the league expanded to 12 teams in 1967 that American players had a chance to play at the professional level once more. Despite one of the NHL's expansion teams being the Minnesota North Stars, not a single player from the state made the roster in the first season. However, the doubling of the NHL also required a complimentary increase in the minor leagues and many American players were finally able to get into the pro ranks in either the AHL, IHL, or CPHL. As the NHL continued to expand throughout the 60s and 70s, the addition of the World Hockey Association in 1972 raised the number of major professional teams in North American teams to 28. With nearly 5 times as many positions to fill as there had been just 5 years prior, American players could no longer be frozen out of any level of the sport.\nCoinciding with the rapid professional expansion was the arrival of Herb Brooks as coach at Minnesota. While Brooks continued the established policy of native Minnesotans only, he was the first coach to lead the Gophers to a national championship. That summer, eight players were selected in the NHL Draft, a stark increase from the two who had been taken in the previous five drafts combined. Brooks kept Minnesota as one of the top teams in the nation for the rest of the decade, winning two more championships, before taking over as head coach for the US national team. He would become legendary at the 1980 Olympics, leading a team made entire out of college players to a win over the juggernaut Soviet Union team in the Miracle on Ice. It is widely regarded as the most stunning upset of the 20th century. Similar to the gold medal team in 1960, the Miracle squad had 12 of its 20 players hail from Minnesota.\n1980 was a turning point in the history of Minnesota hockey. While the success at the Olympics was national news and spawned the professional careers of Brooks as well as players like Rob McClanahan, Mike Ramsey and Mark Pavelich, other events were also occurring. A second USHL had been started in 1961 and served as a senior league until 1979. That summer, the league changed to become the nation's first major junior circuit and develop American junior players for the professional level. While the league was a competitor to the CHL, the USHL structured itself so that its players would still be eligible to play collegiately, something that the CHL players had been barred from accomplishing since 1973. The league was initially centered in and around Minnesota, however, by 2000 not a single USHL team was left in Minnesota. Direct competition from Minnesota high schools was largely responsible for the change, however, the USHL continues to be populated my many players from Minnesota seeking a larger national profile.\nOver the succeeding years, ice hockey has continued its place as the most popular sport in Minnesota. In 2009, Governor Tim Pawlenty signed a bill officially making ice hockey the state sport. Despite the unquestioned support, Minnesota has seen some surprising turn of events. The most obvious counterpoint being the departure of the North Stars. In 1992, the North Stars were suffering from low attendance, having finished with a losing record in each of their previous six seasons. Even a surprise run to the 1991 Stanley Cup Finals was able to turn the team around. At the time, many pointed out that the team's poor on-ice performance wasn't the only issue, with team owner Norman Green's much-publicized fight with the Target Center being top of mind. Regardless of the reasons, the North Stars were in financial trouble and Green sought to move the team. After his first choice of Los Angeles was blocked by the impending arrival of the Anaheim Mighty Ducks, Green moved the team to Dallas in 1993. The NHL swiftly returned to the twin cities with the Minnesota Wild debuting in 2000. However, that did little to mollify the local fans who were forced to watch the Dallas Stars win the Stanley Cup in 1999.\nWomen's hockey.\nWhile Minnesota was one of the first states to begin playing ice hockey, they were a little slower with the addition of the women's game. Some high schools added girls programs in the 1970s but there weren't sufficient teams to start a state tournament until 1995. That same year, the first varsity women's program was begun at Augsburg. Again, however, that came nearly 30 years after the start of the first collegiate women's program. \nWhen women's hockey debuted at the 1998 Winter Olympics, just two players on Team USA's gold-medal-winning squad hailed from Minnesota. Fourteen separate college programs were started over a three-year period and helped to close the gap in women's hockey. Adding to that was the success of the women's team at Minnesota, who won seven national championships over a 16-year span. The vast increase in investment and opportunity for women's hockey in Minnesota produced tangible results; when the US won its second Olympic gold in 2018, seven of team's players came from the North Star state while a further three played collegiately in the state.\nTeams.\nProfessional.\nActive\nInactive\nSenior.\nInactive\nCollegiate.\nActive\nInactive\nJunior.\nActive\nInactive\nTimeline.\n \nPlayers.\nMinnesota has by far the largest number of hockey players in the United States. With more the 58,000 people associated with USA Hockey in 2023, Minnesota is home to more the 10% of the nation's registered ice hockey players. That number is nearly 13,000 more than the next closest state (Massachusetts) but does not include the approximately 6,500 high school players who are not directly affiliated with the national program. While a few other states have comparable percentages in terms of engagement, Minnesota still heads the list with about 1.14% of residents being active hockey players, or about 1 out of every 90 people.\nUnsurprisingly, as the largest population area in the state, the Minneapolis-Saint Paul region is home to a majority of the players from Minnesota. Outside its confines, several regions have and continue to produce notable ice hockey players. The Iron Range, between Grand Rapids and Hoyt Lakes, has long been a font of ice hockey talent. Many others have come from along the northern border and the Mississippi River. However. not every portion of the state has seen success in this respect. The southwest corner of the state, between the borders with Iowa, South Dakota and the Minnesota River has yet to produce any notable players.\nThis high and prolonged interest in the game has resulted in many native Minnesotans achieving notoriety in the sport with some being known nationally or even internationally.\nNotable players by city.\nAda\nAlbert Lea\nAlexandria\nAndover\nAnoka\nApple Valley\nAppleton\nAurora\nAustin\nBabbitt\nBaudette\nBaxter\nBemidji\nBlaine\nBloomington\nBovey\nBrainerd\nBrooklyn Park\nBuffalo\nBurnsville\nCalumet\nCambridge\nCenterville\nChanhassen\nChaska\nChisago City\nChisholm\nCloquet\nColeraine\nCoon Rapids\nCottage Grove\nCrookston\nCrystal\nDelano\nDetroit Lakes\nDuluth\nEagan\nEast Grand Forks\nEden Prairie\nEdina\nElk River\nEly\nEsko\nEveleth\nExcelsior\nFaribault\nFarmington\nForest Lake\nFridley\nGilbert\nGolden Valley\nGrand Rapids\nHam Lake\nHastings\nHermantown\nHibbing\nHinckley\nHopkins\nHoyt Lakes\nInternational Falls\nLa Crescent\nLake City\nLakeville\nLeonidas\nLittle Falls\nMahtomedi\nMankato\nMaple Grove\nMaplewood\nMedina\nMendota Heights\nMinneapolis\nMinnetonka\nMinnetrista\nMoorhead\nMoose Lake\nMound\nMounds View\nNew Brighton\nNew Hope\nNew Ulm\nNisswa\nNorth Oaks\nNorth St. Paul\nNorthfield\nOakdale\nOrono\nOsseo\nPark Rapids\nPengilly\nPlymouth\nPrior Lake\nRed Lake\nRed Wing\nRichfield\nRobbinsdale\nRochester\nRogers\nRoseau\nRosemount\nRoseville\nSaint Paul\nSauk Rapids\nSavage\nShoreview\nShorewood\nSilver Bay\nSouth St. Paul\nSt. Cloud\nSt. Louis Park\nSt. Michael\nStacy\nStillwater\nSturgeon Lake\nThief River Falls\nTonka Bay\nTwo Harbors\nVadnais Heights\nVirginia\nWayzata\nWarroad\nWest St. Paul\nWhite Bear Lake\nWilliams\nWoodbury\nRaised Elsewhere"

        "title": "Cricket and Football Club of Madrid",
        "text": "The Cricket and Foot-Ball Club of Madrid was a Spanish society founded in Madrid at the end of 1879, which was registered at the time of its creation, thus becoming the first legalized sports club in the country. It was founded in the capital in October 1879 under the protection of King Alfonso XII, who was named its Honorary President.\nIt had a section dedicated to football due to the rapid growth of the said sport in England. It was thus the first club formed by native Spaniards (although their presence was somewhat insignificant) for football. Recent studies place it as one of the proto-clubs that pioneered and expanded football in Spain, together with Exiles Football Club (1876) and the Rio Tinto English Club (1878). It is not known with certainty what the fate of this team was, although it seems that it disappeared a few years later.\nOrigins.\nIn the late 1870s, various English workers scattered throughout the peninsula began to establish informal groups that were dedicated to different recreational practices, especially cricket and football, particularly in Spanish ports, such as the ones in Vigo, Andalusia, (Huelva and Seville) and Bilbao, who were the regions that most felt this movement, and then Madrid to a lesser extent. Because of the huge influence and presence of the English in the first steps of football in Spain, it was England who echoed the relevant news that came from Spain about the legalizations or establishment of football clubs, since the news about these British football pioneers in Spain had to be told and broadcast as a new \"conquest\", even if it was a simple project. Thus, on 10 May 1879, the London Standard published, in the middle of a brief paragraph among others concerning the Spanish capital, a curious note referring to the possible constitution of a cricket and football society in Madrid that said the following:\nUnsurprisingly, the news went completely unnoticed in Madrid and by extension, in all of Spain, due to the lack of interest from the readers in football. Alfonso XII was appointed as the entity's honorary president through the mediation of General Rafael de Echagüe, a well-known military man and politician who held several important positions in his different facets in life and with whom the King had a great relationship and who volunteered to gain institutional guardianship and, taking advantage of the situation, get the King to give them the old Hippodrome of the Royal seat of the Casa de Campo, a sports venue used between 1845 and 1867 by the Spanish Horse Breeding Promotion Society, which at that time was in disuse as Madrid had a new, more modern Hippodrome, the Hipódromo de la Castellana, which would later also be a football field. It was at the Casa de Campo where the people of Madrid took their first steps in football.\nMembers.\nAt the time of its establishment, it had a solid structure that made it possible to foresee a long life for the company, as was reflected in its first meeting to decide the directive and the approval of its regulations and statutes:\nThe members of \"Cricket and Foot-ball Club of Madrid\" was made up of a large number of noblemen of those times, as well as distinguished gentlemen who belonged to the Spanish or British high aristocracy and bourgeoisie, holding important positions in the Madrid society in the 1870s. Besides King Alfonso XII, the Honorary President of the club, the presidency was granted to José Figueroa y Torres, the Viscount of Irueste, who was barely 22 years old as a young man with a splendid future and good fortune as the eldest son of the Figueroa y Torres family. Together with him, there were other nobles such as the Viscount of Benaesa and the Count of Villanueva, who surrounded themselves with a wide circle of friendships among those who stood out from the military and wealthy bourgeois with whom they shared business, leisure and ideas.\nAfter its establishment, the club played its first cricket match on 24 October 1879, forming two teams among the members of the society. The event closed with a banquet and was maintained for years as a traditional practice after each sporting event.\nDecline and Collapse.\nLittle more is known about these proto-clubs, which are presumed to have ended up being dissolved due to the still embryonic and not very prolific sport, and above all to the distance between the existing football societies in the country, so they could be able to formalize any dispute. It is not known with certainty what the fate of this team was, although it seems that it disappeared a few years later.\nIn 1880, the same cricketers and footballers of 1879 led by José de Figueroa, brought the sport of athletics to Madrid, which at the time was one of the only European capitals without an athletics stadium."

He was a finalist in the men's doubles at the 1884 Wimbledon Championships partnering Ernest Wool Lewis where they lost to William Renshaw and Ernest Renshaw. In singles he was quarter finalist at the Northern Championships, and semi-finalist at the Princes Club Championships in 1883.

        "title": "Arosa Sri Lanka cricket team in South Africa in 1982–83",
        "text": "In October 1982, a representative team of Sri Lankan cricket players undertook a so-called \"Rebel tour\" to South Africa, to play a series of matches against the South African team colloquially called the 'cuckoo tour'. At the time, the International Cricket Council (ICC) had placed a moratorium on international cricket teams making tours of South Africa, due to the nation's government policy of apartheid, leaving South Africa with no international competition.\nBackground.\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, due to the boycott of South Africa by global sporting bodies, the International Cricket Council blocked any official cricket tours to South Africa. This led to a number of so-called \"rebel\" tours, where individual players were contracted to tour as part of unofficial representative teams. The first such tour recently took place with an English team touring the country.\nHeads of the South African Cricket Union, Ali Bacher and Geoff Dakin, approached Sri Lankan cricketer Tony Opatha in July 1982 to negotiate organising a tour by Sri Lankan players. In September Colin Rushmere, a South African lawyer, flew to Colombo with 14 contracts for the players of a team Opatha had assembled in secret. A month later the Sri Lankan team was touring Zimbabwe and Rushmere visited Harare to confirm the participation of Roy Dias and Duleep Mendis. However both were unable to join the tour team to South Africa as their passports were held by the team manager. When news of the tour broke, the Board of Cricket Control for Sri Lanka (BCCSL) issued 25-year bans to all the tour players. Opatha, who was team manager as well as a player, named the team the 'AROSA Sri Lankan XI'. The 'ARO' standing for the first three initials in his name; Antony Ralph Opatha and the 'SA' standing for South Africa.\nSri Lanka were still an emerging team at the time, having only been granted Test status earlier in 1982, and were not regarded as being in the same league as the South Africans. The tour of a Sri Lankan team, the first ever by a non-white team, was a milestone which showed the world that South Africa (who previously blocked an English team touring in 1968 for containing just one non-white player) was reforming.\nThe tour.\nThe tour was a disaster for the AROSA Sri Lankan team, failing to win a single game. They were soundly beaten in all their one-day and \"test\" matches against the South Africans. Sri Lankan managed only to draw three matches against provincial teams, with the remainder also being defeats. The team was not helped by the absence of stronger performing players like Dias and Mendis and the underperformance of star spin bowler Ajit de Silva who struggled with stress and had a breakdown on tour.\nAftermath.\nThe 14 players were given a 25-year ban, depriving Sri Lankan cricket of a large amount of player talent. Despite earning enough money from the tour to settle down and build houses, most faced social stigma and unemployment afterwards. In 1991 Sri Lankan president Ranasinghe Premadasa lifted the bans on the players allowing many of the rebels to later hold key positions in cricket administration. One player, Flavian Aponso, did play international cricket again at the 1996 Cricket World Cup for the Netherlands (where he had moved after the rebel tour). The Sri Lankan tour is theorised to have helped pave the way for subsequent rebel tours of players from the West Indies a few years later by demonstrating it possible for a non-white cricket team to tour South Africa safely."

        "text": "The 2022 NRL Grand Final was the conclusive and premiership-deciding game of the 2022 National Rugby League season in Australia. It was contested between the Penrith Panthers and the Parramatta Eels on Sunday the 2nd of October at Accor Stadium in Sydney. Penrith, who were both the defending premiers and minor premiers, won the match 28–12 to claim their fourth premiership title, and their first back-to-back premierships in the club's 56-year history. Panthers fullback Dylan Edwards was awarded the Clive Churchill Medal for being judged as the man of the match.\nThe match was preceded by the 2022 NRL State Championship and the 2022 NRL Women's Grand Final. The grand final was attended by 82,415 spectators, and was broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network.\nBackground.\nThis was the first NRL grand final between the Penrith Panthers and the Parramatta Eels, and the second consecutive year that the grand final featured two Sydney-based clubs. The match-up between both clubs has long been regarded as the Western Sydney Derby, due to the long standing rivalry between the two clubs being closely located among Western Sydney. The Panthers, who became the first side since the Melbourne Storm in 2018 to reach three consecutive grand finals, were aiming for a fourth premiership, after defeating Canberra Raiders in 1991, Sydney Roosters in 2003 and South Sydney Rabbitohs in 2021. It was Ivan Cleary's fourth grand final appearance as a coach, after previously losing with the New Zealand Warriors against Manly Sea Eagles in 2011, and losing with Penrith against Melbourne Storm in 2020.\nMeanwhile, the Eels were aiming for their fifth premiership victory; their most recent being against Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs in 1986. Their last grand final appearance was a defeat to the Melbourne Storm in 2009. It was Brad Arthur's first grand final appearance as a coach.\nThe Panthers finished the 2022 regular season in first place after twenty wins and four losses, of which two were against the Eels. Parramatta finished fourth after sixteen wins and eight losses.\nRoute to the final.\nPenrith Panthers.\nThe 2022 Penrith Panthers season was the 56th season in the club's history. Coached by Ivan Cleary and co-captained by Nathan Cleary and Isaah Yeo, the Panthers are competing in the National Rugby League's 2022 Telstra Premiership.\nParramatta Eels.\nThe 2022 Parramatta Eels season was the 76th in the club's history. Coached by Brad Arthur and co-captained by Clinton Gutherson and Junior Paulo, they will compete in the NRL's 2022 Telstra Premiership. The season saw a club record membership tally of 34,264.\nPre-match.\nTeam selection.\nDylan Edwards, Stephen Crichton, Brian To'o, Jarome Luai, Nathan Cleary, Apisai Koroisau, James Fisher-Harris, Viliame Kikau, Liam Martin, Moses Leota and Isaah Yeo made their third-straight grand final appearance for Penrith, whilst Koroisau also played in the 2014 premiership decider for the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Ryan Matterson and Bailey Simonsson were the only players for Parramatta to have played in prior grand finals; Matterson won for the Sydney Roosters in 2018, while Simonsson played for the Canberra Raiders in 2019.\nBroadcasting.\nThe match was broadcast live on the Nine Network and delayed on Fox League in Australia as well as on Sky Sport in New Zealand. Radio broadcasters included ABC, Triple M, 2GB, SEN and Koori Radio.\nEntertainment.\nOn 23 September 2022, the pre-match entertainment acts for the grand final were announced. This included Jimmy Barnes, Mahalia Barnes, A.Girl, Diesel, Josh Teskey, Emma Donovan, Sheldon Riley and Bliss n Eso. The Australian national anthem was performed by Alinta Chidzey.\nOfficiating.\nAshley Klein refereed the match, his second NRL grand final. Grant Atkins was the senior review official, and Phil Henderson and Drew Oultram were the touch judges. Gerard Sutton was the standby referee and David Munro the standby touch judge.\nAttendance.\nThe 2022 Grand Final was the first since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to have no crowd restrictions. On 27 September 2022, the match was sold out.\nCurtain-raiser matches.\nCurtain-raiser matches on the day were the NRL State Championship between the Norths Devils and the Penrith Panthers, and NRLW Grand Final between the Newcastle Knights and the Parramatta Eels. Both were shown live on the Nine Network in Australia.\nMatch.\n&lt;section begin=scoreboard/&gt;\n&lt;section end=scoreboard/&gt;\nStatistics.\nPenrith Panthers:\nParramatta Eels:\nPost-match.\nParramatta forward Ryan Matterson was charged by the match review with a grade one crusher tackle against Dylan Edwards. Matterson was criticised after taking an early guilty plea and electing to be suspended for three matches instead of taking a $4,000 fine. Matterson defended his decision telling reporters \"I just feel that $4000 is pretty hefty considering I have already paid close to $4000 in fines this year for things that are absurd\", with the forward also suggesting that the charge was not warranted.\nPenrith players were criticised for their celebrations after their victory, with Sydney media identities outspoken against the way they celebrated. Jarome Luai came under scrutiny for a social media post that some found offensive. Former Penrith captain Greg Alexander and coach Ivan Cleary defended the players against the criticism.\nBoth grand final teams' players featured in squads selected for the 2021 Rugby League World Cup to be played in October–November 2022. Ten Panthers players were selected with the greatest representation (5) to play for Samoa. Parramatta had also had ten players selected, with the greatest representation (3) to play for New Zealand.\nAs premiership winners, Penrith earned the right to play in the World Club Challenge against 2022 Super League Grand Final winners St Helens. The match was played on 18 February 2023 at BlueBet Stadium.\nOpening Matches.\nTwo opening matches were played on the ground prior to the grand final: the NRL State Championship and NRL Women's Grand Final. Both matches were broadcast live throughout Australia by the Nine Network."

        "text": "Motocross Maniacs 2 (released as Crazy Bikers in Europe) is a 1999 racing game for the Game Boy Color, developed and published by Konami. A sequel to the 1989 Game Boy title \"Motocross Maniacs\", the game is a racing game in which the player drives across a side-scrolling motocross course. \nGameplay.\nIn \"Motocross Maniacs 2\", players complete one of ten motocross courses using a dirt bike, completing stunts over features such as loops, jumps, ramps and hills. The game has two modes: 'Time Attack' requires a player to complete a course within a set time limit, and 'Championship' requires the player to complete a series of five consecutive races whilst scoring points from stunts to receive the highest ranking. The game also contains a track editor supporting up to three custom courses. Two-player games are supported with the Game Link Cable.\nReception.\n\"Motocross Maniacs 2\" received positive reviews, with favorable comparisons to the 1984 Nintendo game \"Excitebike\". Craig Harris of \"IGN\" stated the game was \"a great game that starts out a little on the boring side, but gets much better with the more complex courses. It's no \"Excitebike\", but it's close.\" Ty Kris of \"Nintendojo\" stated game was \"probably the best motocross game available on the Game Boy, praising the game's \"killer level editor\", and \"excellent background music\" as \"some of the best on the system\"."

In the 2012 All-Star Game, the Central League won two games, so the Central League was given waiver priority over the Central League."

He saw immediate playing time in football as a true freshman in 1950 and helped the team compile a 9–2 record, playing running back, defensive back, punter and kick returner. In their 1951 game against the Mississippi State Maroons, Cole played a major role, scoring a 65-yard interception return touchdown and what should have been the game-winning reception to win 27–21. However, the referees made a mistake, ruling that Cole had been out of bounds, and Mississippi State eventually won; a photo published the next day in \"The Commercial Appeal\" showed he was clearly in bounds on the catch.\nAt the end of the 1951 season, Cole received an honorable mention on the 1951 Little All-America college football team. He missed the 1952 season due to a leg injury, and while injured, Memphis State won only two games while losing seven. Cole attempted to return to the team in 1953, saying that \"if [his legs] stood up under the strain, all right. If they didn't he'd have to call it quits.\" He made the team and became one of their top players, being one of their \"big threats.\" His best career game came against Mississippi Southern on October 31 that season, when he played a key role in helping Memphis State pull off the 27–13 upset. In each of three successive plays in the match, Cole blocked a field goal to keep the score a 13–13 tie, returned a kickoff 77-yards for a touchdown, and kicked the extra point to put the team up 20–13. He was carried off the field by his teammates after the game ended. Following the 1953 season, where he helped Memphis State compile a 6–4 record, Cole received honorable mention on the 1953 Little All-America college football team. He played one more season at Memphis State in 1954, and helped them go 3–4–3, being named their \"best tackler\" at the end of the year.\nLater life and death.\nAfter graduating from Memphis State in 1955, Cole began an officiating career, starting at the school's prep games. By 1958, he had become a back judge in the Southeastern Conference, where he served through 1970 and officiated several bowl games, including two Sugar Bowls, one Cotton Bowl, two Orange Bowls, two Liberty Bowls, and two Gator Bowls. Widely regarded as one of their \"elite\" officials, Cole was brought into the National Football League (NFL) as a field judge in 1970. He was 37 at the time, being younger than most other officials hired by the NFL. He worked with the NFL through 1976, and served in two Pro Bowls, two conference championships, and numerous playoff games.\nCole also worked at Coca-Cola, for the city of Memphis as Solid Waste Director, and on the city's Planning Commission in the 1970s. After leaving Memphis in 1982, he remained in the solid waste industry, later working for Browning-Ferris Industries (BFI) and Waste Management until retiring in 2008.\nCole was inducted into the University of Memphis \"M\" Club Hall of Fame in 1977, the American Football Foundation Hall of Fame as both an official and a player, and the Tennessee Sports Hall of Fame in 2002. Additionally, he was named to the Memphis State Tigers All-Time Football Team in 1958.\nCole died on November 17, 2022, at age 90."

        "title": "2023 Novak Djokovic tennis season",
        "text": "The 2023 Novak Djokovic tennis season is considered one of the greatest tennis seasons of all time by an individual tennis player. It officially began on 1 January 2023, with the start of the Adelaide International, and ended 25 November 2023 after Serbia's defeat by Italy in the semifinals of the Davis Cup Finals.\nDuring this season, Djokovic:\nYearly summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nAdelaide International.\nDjokovic reached the final without dropping a set, then defeated Sebastian Korda in the final, 6–7(8–10), 7–6(7–3), 6–4, saving a championship point in the second set. It was Djokovic's 92nd career title, and the first time he won a title in Adelaide since 2007.\nAustralian Open.\nDjokovic defeated Stefanos Tsitsipas in the final, 6–3, 7–6(7–4), 7–6(7–5), to win his 10th Australian Open title and 22nd major overall, equaling Nadal's all-time record. He only lost one set during the tournament (to Enzo Couacaud in the second round).\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nThe World No. 1 was on a roll, extending his winning streak to 15 matches before losing to eventual champion Daniil Medvedev in the semifinals of the Dubai Tennis Championships.\nIndian Wells and Miami Opens.\nIn March, Djokovic withdrew from the Indian Wells Masters and Miami Open after being denied a visa into the United States due to being unvaccinated. Indian Wells tournament director Tommy Haas, Miami Open tournament director James Blake, and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis had lobbied federal government officials for an exemption, but were unsuccessful.\nClay court season.\nMonte-Carlo Masters.\nDespite leading 6–4, 4–2, two-time champion Djokovic was upset in the round of 16 by Lorenzo Musetti, who came back to win the match 4–6, 7–5, 6–4 for his first ever win against a reigning World No. 1 and first ever win against Djokovic.\nSrpska Open.\nDjokovic was upset in the quarterfinals 4–6, 6–7(6–8) by compatriot and eventual champion Dusan Lajovic. Djokovic squandered 15 of 16 break point chances and a 6–3 lead in the second set tiebreak.\nMadrid Open.\nDjokovic withdrew from Madrid Open due to concerns over an elbow injury.\nItalian Open.\nIn his final event before his 36th birthday, defending champion Djokovic reached the quarterfinals for the 17th straight year. In the quarterfinals, following a one hour rain delay at the end of the second set, Djokovic was defeated by eventual runner-up Holger Rune 6–2, 4–6, 6–2. It was Djokovic's earliest loss in Rome since 2013.\nFrench Open.\nAfter defeating world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz in the semifinals, Djokovic defeated Casper Ruud in the final, 7–6(7–1), 6–3, 7–5 to win the men's singles tennis title at the 2023 French Open, a all-time record-breaking 23rd men's singles major. He became the first man to achieve a triple career Grand Slam, and became the oldest French Open champion at the age of 36 years and 20 days.\nGrass court season.\nWimbledon.\nDjokovic then played at the Wimbledon Championships, where he was bidding to win a fifth consecutive title and a record-equalling eighth title. He reached the semifinals with straight-set victories over Pedro Cachin, Jordan Thompson and Stan Wawrinka, and four set victories over Hubert Hurkacz and Andrey Rublev. In the semifinals, he faced Jannik Sinner in a rematch of their quarterfinal epic the previous year, and Djokovic won in straight sets to reach his fifth consecutive and 9th overall Wimbledon final, as well as his record-extending 35th major final, where he faced Carlos Alcaraz. He subsequently lost an epic final to Alcaraz in five sets, ending his 34-match winning streak at Wimbledon since 2018 and his unbeaten run in both Wimbledon finals and Centre Court matches since his 2013 defeat to Andy Murray.\nAmerican outdoor hardcourt season.\nCincinnati Open.\nThis was Djokovic's first tournament in the United States since the 2021 US Open, following the lifting of COVID-19 vaccination requirements for international air travelers in May 2023. In the third round, Djokovic defeated Gaël Monfils in straight sets to extend his perfect head-to-head record to a record-breaking 19–0 (thus overtaking the previous record hold by Rafael Nadal against Richard Gasquet at 18–0). Djokovic then defeated ninth seed Taylor Fritz and 16th seed Alexander Zverev in straight sets to reach his record-extending 57th Masters 1000 final, doing so without the loss of a set.\nIn yet another epic final, Djokovic avanged his Wimbledon loss by beating Carlos Alcaraz, 5–7, 7–6(9–7), 7–6(7–4) to win his third Cincinnati Masters title and record-extending 39th ATP Tour Masters 1000 title overall. He won the match from a set down and down a break in the second set, along with saving a championship point in the second-set tiebreaker. It was the second time he saved a championship point en route to a title in 2023, following his triumph in Adelaide, and it was his ninth career title that he won after saving match points during a tournament. At 3 hours and 49 minutes, this match was the longest best-of-three-sets ATP Tour final and the longest match in the tournament's history. The final between Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic was later named the ATP Match of the Year. Djokovic called it one of his toughest matches, and said \"It did feel like a Grand Slam final, even more than that to be honest\". He compared the intensity and toughness of the match to his match against Rafael Nadal in the 2012 Australian Open final.\nUS Open.\nDjokovic then played at the US Open where he dropped only two sets en route to the title, both to his fellow countryman Laslo Djere in a win from two sets down in the third round. In the quarterfinals, Djokovic defeated No. 9 Taylor Fritz to record his 250th career victory over a Top 10 player, making him the first player to accomplish this milestone since the ATP rankings began in 1973. By reaching a 47th men's singles major semifinal, Djokovic surpassed Roger Federer's Open Era record. By reaching the final, Djokovic matched Federer's record of reaching all major finals in a season three times.\nIn the final, he faced Daniil Medvedev in a rematch of their 2021 US Open final, where Medvedev had triumphed in straight sets for his first major title and to deny Djokovic the Grand Slam. This time, Djokovic defeated Medvedev in straight sets to win his fourth US Open title and a record-extending 24th men's singles major title overall, also equaling Margaret Court's all-time record of major singles titles by either sex. Djokovic became the oldest US Open men's singles champion in the Open Era, at 36 years and 111 days, and the first man to win three majors in a season four times. This triumph also meant that, at the time, Djokovic had won one third of all Grand Slams he had entered (24 out of 72), and had been in the final in half of all Grand Slams he had played (36 out of 72). By winning his first-round match, Djokovic reclaimed the world No. 1 position from Alcaraz at the end of the tournament.\nEuropean indoor hard court season.\nParis Masters.\nAfter a six-week break, Djokovic returned to the tour at the Paris Masters, where he won his second-round match over Tomás Martín Etcheverry in his 1069th career match, surpassing Rafael Nadal for the fourth most in the Open Era. In the quarterfinals, Djokovic defeated defending champion Holger Rune in a rematch of the previous year's final. He went on to defeat Grigor Dimitrov in the final to win his record-extending seventh Paris Masters title and 40th Masters overall. Djokovic also played in the doubles event with Krajinovic as a warm-up for the upcoming Davis Cup Finals. They won in the first round, but withdrew the next round.\nATP Finals.\nDjokovic was put in the green group along with Stefanos Tsitsipas, Jannik Sinner and Holger Rune. By winning his first round robin match over Rune, he secured the year-end world No. 1 position for a record-extending eighth time. Djokovic then lost to Sinner in a third set tiebreaker, which ended his 19-match winning streak and marked his first loss since the Wimbledon final. Djokovic rebounded quickly, however, and played some of his best tennis of the season to defeat second seed Alcaraz in the semifinals and home favourite Sinner in the final—both in straight sets—to win a record-breaking seventh ATP Finals title. This victory saw him become the first current world No. 1 to win the event since Andy Murray in 2016. Despite playing only 12 tournaments, Djokovic led the tour in titles won with seven, the most he has claimed in a season since 2016. On 20 November, Djokovic became the first player in singles to reach 400 weeks at No. 1.\nDavis Cup Finals.\nits place in the Davis Cup Final 8 in Malaga in November.\nDjokovic played in his final event of the year at the 2023 Davis Cup Finals in December. He had helped Serbia reach the quarterfinals by winning his 20th consecutive Davis Cup singles match against Alejandro Davidovich Fokina in a 3–0 win over Spain in Group C, where they finished in second place. In the quarterfinals against Britain, Djokovic defeated Cameron Norrie in singles to take his nation to the semifinals for the second time in three years and become the outright most successful Serbian player in the history of the Davis Cup with 44 wins in the competition, moving him one ahead of Nenad Zimonjić.\nIn the semifinals against Italy, Djokovic faced Sinner for the third time in 11 days, losing in three sets despite holding three consecutive match points.

Due to NCAA player eligibility rules at the time, freshmen could not play varsity basketball, so Arnold did not begin his career for the Longhorns until his sophomore season in 1965–66. In his three seasons, Arnold appeared in 66 games and averaged 13.3 points and 2.3 rebounds per game. His best year came in 1967–68, his senior season, in which he averaged 19.9 points and 3.4 rebounds per game while leading Texas to a second-place finish in the Southwest Conference (SWC). Arnold led the conference in scoring and was named to the All-SWC First Team while also being honored as the SWC Player of the Year.\nArnold did not pursue a professional career. Shortly after graduating from Texas in 1968, he was tapped to be the newest head boys' basketball coach for Elgin High School in Elgin, Texas."

        "text": "The 2022–23 Penn State Nittany Lions men's ice hockey season was the 17th season of play for the program and 10th in the Big Ten Conference. The Nittany Lions represented Penn State University in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, were coached by Guy Gadowsky in his 11th season, and played their home games at Pegula Ice Arena.\nSeason.\nThe start to the season for Penn State could not have been better. The Nittany Lions won each of their first 9 games to rocket to the top of the national rankings. While the slate of games wasn't arduous, PSU was getting consistent scoring from its veteran offensive contingent. The goals being produced were more than enough for Liam Soulière, who had taken over as the team's starting goaltender. The junior netminder helped the team trim its goals against average by about half a goal per game over the course of the year. Those improvements led to the team's early-season success which culminated in a win over then-#1 Michigan.\nPenn State got into a bit of a rough patch after they started their conference schedule; the team was only able to earn a split in five consecutive weekends against other Big Ten teams. Luckily, the Big Ten was the highest-ranked team that season and the Nittany Lions were still able to retain a top-10 position in the PairWise rankings. PSU also buoyed itself by sweeping its non-conference schedule, finishing the regular season with a perfect 10–0 record.\nWhen the Nittany Lions began the second half of their season, they were 12 games above .500 and in the top 5 of all polls and rankings. Penn State began to fall from its lofty perch with its first losing weekend of the season to Michigan State in early January. While the offense continued to play well, the defense and goaltending faltered in the back half of the year. Over its final 12 games, Penn State went 3–8–1 and finished 6th out of 7 teams in the Big Ten. The Nittany Lions were doing this despite outshooting and outskating their opponents on most night. In the game against Michigan on January 27, for example, Penn State had twice as many shots on goal (38 to 19) but still carried a 2–4 deficit into the third period where a pair of empty-net goals made the game look more lopsided than it actually was.\nPenn State's poor results carried over into the postseason but this time it was the offense that failed. In their 3-game series with Ohio State, PSU scored just 4 goals. While Soulière appeared to recover his early-season form towards the end of the round, he couldn't prevent the Nittany Lions from being knocked out in the quarterfinal round of the conference tournament.\nWhile their poor showing in the second half of the season was worrisome, Penn State was saved by its first half performance, particularly its non-conference record. Despite having a losing record in the Big Ten, PSU was comfortable above .500 overall and ranked 8th nationally at the conclusion of the regular season. That guaranteed them not only a spot in the NCAA tournament, but a #2 seed as well. As the host of one of the four regionals, Penn State was automatically placed in the Midwest bracket (Allentown). They were set against Michigan Tech in the first round and though they were the higher seed, their recent performance tempered expectations for the team. As soon as the puck hit the ice, Penn State returned to their early-season form and completely dominated the Huskies. The Nittany Lions opened the scoring just over 2 minutes into the match and, though they didn't score for the remainder of the period, they controlled the pace of play. PSU netted three goals in the third, getting contributions from across its lineup, to build a 4–0 lead while the defense appeared to half little trouble handling the pop-gun offense of Michigan Tech. Penn State scored 4 more times in the final frame, including a 0-angle goal from Chase McLane, and finish with an overwhelming 8–0 victory. The win was the largest shutout victory in NCAA history, surpassing the mark set by St. Lawrence in 1988.\nThe Nittany Lions advanced to the Regional Final for the second time in its history and were set against a familiar foe, Michigan. Penn State had surrendered 16 goals in the previous three games to the Wolverines but their play from the Tech game carried over and the Lions held off the Michigan juggernaut. The defense did well to limit the Maize and Blue to 25 shots in the first two periods while Soulière stopped everything that leaked through. Meanwhile, on Michigan's only penalty of the game, Penn State was able to capitalize on their chance and score a power play goal at the end of the second to take a narrow lead. Penn State continued to trade blows with Michigan while neither goalie gave an inch. Ultimately, however, Penn State gave the Wolverines one too many chances and Michigan finally converted on their 4th power play of the game to tie the score. The match headed into overtime and both teams went into attack mode, trying the end the game quickly. Unfortunately for PSU, a perfectly-placed shout from Mackie Samoskevich eluded Soulière's blocker just 52 seconds into the extra session and ended Penn State's season in heartbreaking fashion.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "text": "Tennis is considered one of the famous sports in eastern Europe. Each region birthing excellent players that left an ever-lasting print with their rich careers, one of which is Russia.\nHistory.\nTennis is introduced to Russia.\nArthur Davidovich McPherson (1870–1919), a native of Petersburg, was the founder and president of the first All-Russian Union of Lawn Tennis Clubs, the forerunner of today's Russian Tennis Federation. In 1903 he organized the first St. Petersburg tennis championship, and four years later he set up the first national tournament. By 1913, the Russian championship was on the international tour and the game was thriving. McPherson also helped establish the country's first Olympic Committee. \nUnder the USSR.\nDuring the Soviet era, tennis was on the edge of survival due to its lack of appearance in the Olympic games, cost, and strong association with the Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov royal dynasty. From 1974 to 1984, Soviet tennis players had been forced by the Tennis Federation of the USSR to boycott all the international competitions, except for the Davis Cup, in an unsuccessful attempt of the regime to influence apartheid in South Africa. In addition, local men's tennis players were seriously bullied by the other Soviet sportspeople for competing in a 'girlie' sport. At a certain point, about 80 percent of tennis coaches in the USSR were women.\nPost USSR.\nSince the end of the Soviet era, tennis has grown in popularity and Russia has produced many famous tennis players. In recent years, the number of top Russian women players has been considerable, with both Maria Sharapova and Dinara Safina reaching number one in the WTA rankings. Other Russian women to achieve international success include Anna Chakvetadze, Elena Dementieva, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Anastasia Myskina, Nadia Petrova, Vera Zvonareva and Anna Kournikova. The Russian Federation has won the Fed Cup 4 times, in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2008.\nAt the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Russia swept the women's tennis podium with Elena Dementieva winning the gold, Dinara Safina and Vera Zvonareva the silver and bronze, respectively. As of 5 October 2009, four Russian women were ranked in the WTA tour's top 10.\nRussia also boasts three former number 1 men's players—Safina's older brother Marat Safin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Daniil Medvedev. Russian men currently in the top 10 include Daniil Medvedev and Andrey Rublev, the former of whom was a finalist at the 2019 US Open, 2021 Australian Open, 2022 Australian Open. He won the 2021 US Open. Medvedev had briefly reached the number 1 ranking in February 2022, before being overtaken by Novak Djokovic. He reclaimed his first spot again in June 2022. Medvedev was the first player to reach number 1 without being a member of the 'Big Four'; Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Andy Murray, and Rafael Nadal, since February 2004."

Three teams who finish on the podium qualify for the Olympics through the 2022 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Liverpool with a large proportion of quota places distributed at the same meet in Antwerp, Belgium by the following year. The 2024 World Cup series will also hand the gymnasts an opportunity to earn more spots in separate apparatus events.\nIn rhythmic gymnastics, the 2022 World Championships, scheduled for 14 to 18 September in Sofia, Bulgaria, witnessed individual and group all-around medalists book their tickets in Paris. Most quota places were allocated at the same meet in Valencia, Spain by the following year with fourteen individual gymnasts and five nations across all continents vying for qualification.\nUp to half of the trampoline qualifying slots will be awarded to the highest-ranked gymnasts at the 2023 World Championships in Birmingham with the majority coming from the 2023–2024 World Cup series. Across all gymnastics disciplines, the remaining places will be offered to the gymnasts vying for qualification at their respective continental meets."

        "text": "Pocket Bowling is a bowling video game developed and published by Jaleco for the Game Boy Color. The game was a launch title for the Japanese release of the Game Boy Color and the first bowling game for the platform. \nGameplay.\n\"Pocket Bowling\" is an arcade-style bowling game. Players bowl in a ten pin bowling setup by aligning the ball along the alley and adjusting curve and power. Players can select one of six characters who have different qualities in terms of power and technique. Games are played across ten frames with a maximum score of 300, including points scoring features such as strikes, spares, gutter balls and splits. \n\"Pocket Bowling\" contains several modes. 'Standard Mode', for one or two players, allows players to take turns to play a game. 'Tournament Mode' allows players to select a character and compete against four computer-controlled opponents in three games across four bowling alleys in a knockout-style elimination game. 'Training Mode' allows players to practice moves on a series of customisable layouts of pins.\nReception.\n\"Pocket Bowling\" received mixed reviews. Craig Harris of \"IGN\" stated that \"Pocket Bowling\" was \"definitely the winner\" of Game Boy Color bowling games, compared to \"10 Pin Bowling\", praising the \"effort (that) went in to making the game as complete as possible\" with several game modes. \"Game Boy Xtreme\" positively assessed the game as \"surprisingly playable\". In a negative review for \"Total Game Boy\", Jem Roberts stated \"there's very little to the graphics at all\" and \"there's hardly anything to the game itself\", expecting a greater \"challenge or sense of competition\". Brett Alan Weiss of \"Allgame\" similarly praised the lack of difficulty, stating \"it's a shame \"Pocket Bowling\" is such an easy game to master. It has crisp graphics and a professional but fun presentation. The playfield is laid out well, the controls are tight and the pins behave realistically. This would have been a fun game to play when standing in line at the bank or waiting for a lane on league night. Unfortunately, the game is not worth more than a rental.\" "

The record of both teams at the Five Nations tournament was poor: Scotland finishing last, England second-last. The two teams were separated by just one-point, both on the final standings and in their Five Nations fixture. The Scots came back to win the encounter 15–16, breaking their six-year, two-match losing streak at Twickenham Stadium. \nWith the previous weeks result, the competition between both teams was considered very tight. Despite both teams' poor records in the Five Nations, it was notably mentioned as unworthy by the news-media. \nScotland ran away with a dominant victory at home, 26–6. The twenty-point win was Scotland's biggest victory over England, and remained so for until they met in the 1986 Five Nations."

        "text": "Mark Blair is an Irish former rugby union player, who played lock professionally for Edinburgh, Ulster, RC Narbonne and the Border Reivers.\nHe attended The Royal School, Armagh, and after leaving school attended technical collage for year while playing for City of Armagh RFC, and represented Ulster at under-20 and under-21 levels. He went to Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, and played rugby for Currie RFC. He had a trial for Scotland, for whom he qualified through residency. He played club rugby in New Zealand in 1996 and 1997, and was selected a few times for Counties, where he played alongside Jonah Lomu.\nHe signed a professional contract with Edinburgh Reivers for 1997-98, The following season he had offers from Edinburgh and Ulster, and chose to sign for Ulster, joining Ballymena R.F.C. However, he sustained an ankle ligament injury playing five-a-side football in the summer, arrived unfit, and began the season for Ulster behind part-timer Murtagh Rea. He eventually won a starting spot in the second row alongside Gary Longwell playing in eight successive wins on the way to Ulster's victory in the 1999 Heineken Cup Final.\nHe made 55 appearances for Ulster over five seasons, and helped Ballymena win the All-Ireland League in 2003, before joining RC Narbonne ahead of the 2003-04 season. He had signed for three years, but left after a single season after the new coach objected to him going home to attend his brother's wedding. He returned to Scotland, signing a two-year deal with the Border Reivers. The team was disbanded at the end of his second season, and he retired from professional rugby, although he continued to play club rugby with Currie until about 2009. He set up a property development company with his brother-in-law, and worked for the IRFU Exiles programme until 2017."

The men's basketball tournament for the school year 1998–99 began on July 11, 1998, and the host school for the season was the University of the East.\nThe Tigers ended the double round-robin eliminations with seven wins and seven losses. The UE Red Warriors and the UP Fighting Maroons had the same win–loss record, but UE was ranked higher due to a superior quotient. This left UST to contend with UP in a playoff game for the remaining fourth Final Four slot. The two teams split their elimination round games, with the Tigers winning the first round in overtime, and the Maroons getting payback in the next round with an 80–78 win. UST won the playoff with an eight-point lead at 80–72 and had once again faced the De La Salle Green Archers for the second straight year in the semifinal round. They earlier defeated the Green Archers in the second round of eliminations to give them their only loss of the season.\nIn the Final Four, the Tigers took away La Salle's twice-to-beat advantage with a 55–51 win to extend the series to a deciding Game 2. The concluding match saw eleven lead changes until La Salle's Renren Ritualo drove and converted from the baseline to bring UST down by three points. The Tigers were unable to score as they committed a series of turnovers. They eventually lost at 51–56, sending La Salle to the Finals.\nVeteran forward Richard Yee, who had averaged 13.1 points per gane was selected to the Mythical second team during the presentation of individual awards.\nRoster changes.\nThe Tigers lost four of their players from the 1994–96 champion squads to departures, as Henry Ong and Romel David had already graduated. Richard Melencio and Chandler Donaldson, meanwhile were signed to teams in the newly-formed Metropolitan Basketball Association to play professionally.\nSchedule and results.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format. All games were aired on PTV 4 and SBN 21 by Silverstar Sports.\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nRichard Yee was picked fifth in the first round of the 1999 PBA draft by the Derrick Pumaren-led Purefoods Tender Juicy Hotdogs team on January 16, 1999. Gerard Francisco was also selected in the same rookie draft as the tenth overall pick by the Adonis Tierra-coached Sta. Lucia Realtors.\nDale Singson joined the Iloilo Megavoltz in the MBA from 1999 until the middle of the 2000 season after a buyout deal by the Shell Velocity team which sent him to the PBA during the 2000 All-Filipino Cup eliminations."

        "text": "The Canterbury Country cricket team represents the rural areas of the northern part of the Canterbury Region in the South Island of New Zealand. It covers the area east of the Southern Alps, between the Clarence River in the north and the Rakaia River in the south, excluding metropolitan Christchurch. It competes in the Hawke Cup and has its base in Rangiora.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nCricket was played in Rangiora and Kaiapoi in the 1850s. The first North Canterbury Cricket Association was formed in Rangiora in August 1892, and the competition that season comprised six clubs: Cust, Oxford, Ashley County, Ohoka, Amberley and Woodend; Amberley won the first title. The association's name was changed to Ashley County Cricket Association in September 1896, then back to North Canterbury Cricket Association in September 1911.\nThe association's representative team frequently played against other Canterbury associations. An annual competition among them was established in the 1920s, and a combined associations team played an annual match against Canterbury. \nIn 1962 a new body was formed covering all the associations, initially called the North Canterbury Minor Association. Its constituent sub-associations were Ashley (renamed again from North Canterbury to avoid confusion), Banks Peninsula, Ellesmere, Hurunui and Malvern.\nHawke Cup years.\nThe newly-formed North Canterbury team played its first Hawke Cup elimination match against Central Otago in December 1963, winning on the first innings. One of the founders of the Association, Allan Wright, was also the team's first captain. He led North Canterbury to their first Hawke Cup title, when they beat Manawatu in January 1967; he was also the team's top-scorer in this match, with 45 and 75. It was the first time a team south of Nelson had won the Cup since Southland in 1913. North Canterbury also won the Cup in March 1988 when they beat Southland.\nIn the early 1990s the association changed its name to Canterbury Country. It now has two divisions – North Canterbury for the area north of Christchurch, and Country South, for the area south of Christchurch. \nCanterbury Country won the Hawke Cup at the first attempt, beating Nelson narrowly in March 1993. They have since won the Cup six more times, most recently in November 2022 when they beat Hawke's Bay and retained the title until November 2023."

        "text": "Scott O. Swofford (October 11, 1949 – September 3, 2000) was an American football and coach. At one time Swofford served as head coach at Tarkio College, but he was best known as the long time head football coach at Wentzville Holt High School in Wentzville, Missouri.\nEarly life and playing career.\nSwofford was born in St. Louis, where he attended Cleveland High School. He played football at Cleveland, from which he graduated in 1968. Following graduation, he attended Central Methodist College in Fayette, Missouri, where he was a four-year starting linebacker. Swofford was named team captain in his senior year and was recognized as the team's most valuable player at the close of the season. He was All-District and an All-Conference player. In addition to football, Swofford also captained the rugby team for four years at Central Methodist. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Education in 1972.\nSwofford also played Rugby competitively for the St. Louis Falcons Rugby team in the Missouri Rugby Football Union. The team, led by Swofford as captain, finished the 1979 season with a second place finish in the national championship among more than 3,000 rugby clubs in the nation.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from Central Methodist in 1972, Swofford spent one year coaching and teaching at Fayette High School.\nIn February 1981, Swofford was named head football coach and associate director of admissions at Tarkio College in Tarkio, Missouri. Tarkio competed in the Heart of America Athletic Conference (HAAC). In taking the position, Swofford inherited the nation's longest losing streak, which at that time was 26 games. In the second game of the 1981 season, Swofford led the to a 20–12 victory over to end the nation's longest losing streak at 27 games. Despite securing the Owls first win in three seasons, Swofford's contract was not renewed after the first year at Tarkio. College officials indicated that Swofford overspent on the football budget, and Swofford said he was dismissed because of conflicts with the administration of the school. Swofford believed the school administrators did not like the boot camp atmosphere and strict discipline he brought to the football program.\nIn 1986, Swofford returned to Wentzville Holt High School, where he had previously served as an assistant from 1973 to 1975. This time the 36-year-old Swofford would be the head coach, hired to replace Dennis Graser following a 5-5 season in 1985. Swofford promised to instill discipline in the squad, both on and off the field. In addition to coaching football and teaching health and physical education, Swofford also served as head track coach for the Indians. During the mid-1990s at Holt, Swofford coached Dan Alexander, an All-Metro First Team running back recognized as the top player in St. Charles County, who went to play as a First Team All-Big 12 Conference linebacker/fullback for the Nebraska Cornhuskers. Alexander was later drafted by the Tennessee Titans in the 2001 NFL Draft. When his uniform number was retired at Holt High School in 2012, Alexander credited Swofford with much of his success on the field.\nIn 1999, Swofford began serving as an assistant coach of the Washington University Bears for two years coaching the running backs and special teams. In his first year at Washington University, he assisted in leading the team to its first NCAA playoff appearance in school history.\nPersonal life and legacy.\nSwofford was a resident of Lake St. Louis, Missouri. He served as president of the St. Louis Metro Coaches Association from 1997 to 2000. He was also active in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Swofford died on September 3, 2000, after suffering a heart attack in the football team offices at Washington University while he was reviewing film of the team's win from the previous night. More than 3,000 people attended Swofford's memorial service that was held on the 50-yard line of Francis Field on September 6, 2000. Among the speaker's at Swofford's funeral was Missouri Lieutenant Governor Roger B. Wilson.\nIn April 2002, the board of the Wentzville School District voted to name the new football stadium at Timberland High School in honor of Scott Swofford, where he served as a teacher from the time the school opened in 2000 until his death.\nIn 2010, Swofford was posthumously inducted into the Hairston Sports Hall of Fame at Central Methodist University."

These sixteen works were first published individually in \"The New Yorker\". The works also appears in \"The Stories of John Cheever\" (1978).\nSeveral stories in this volume are among the most frequently anthologized of Cheever's work, notably \"The Swimmer\", \"The Angel of the Bridge\", \"Clementina\", and \"The Music Teacher.\" \nStories.\nThe date of publication in \"The New Yorker\" appears in parentheses.&lt;br&gt;\nReception.\nBiographer Blake Bailey notes that a number of critics registered \"a vaguely troubled note about the direction of Cheever's work.\" Orville Prescott in the daily \"New York Times\" considered some of the stories \"sinister fantasies\", among these \"The Swimmer\" and \"The Ocean.\" Critic John W. Aldridge attacked Cheever's \"nightmare tonalities\", comparing the stories to \"macabre\" creations of cartoonist Charles Addams.\nThe critical response to \"The Brigadier and the Grass Widow\" was largely positive and marks a period during which Cheever \"began to attain his first genuine fame and wealth.\"\nIn a \"Time\" magazine review by Alwyn Lee, Cheever was approvingly dubbed the \"Ovid in Ossining.\" The title, according to biographer Patrick Meanor, \"encapsulates Cheever's major attitude toward his subject matter and identifies his use of myth as the major structuring principle of his fiction. His specific use of Ovidian themes of transformation and metamorphosis becomes increasingly obvious from \"The Brigadier and the Golf Widow,\" until the end of his career, particularly in two of his most anthologized stories, \"The Swimmer\" and \"The Music Teacher\".\"\nCritic Lynn Waldeland reports that the collection contains \"the greatest number of frequently anthologized stories, including \"The Swimmer\", \"The Angel of the Bridge\", \"Clementina\", and \"The Music Teacher\".\" Critic William Pelen \"declared The \"Brigadier and the Golf Widow\" Cheever's best volume of short stories.\""

It is not unknown for confirmed deals to be cancelled at a later date.\nTransfers involving Wasps and Worcester Warriors are not included on this list, following the suspension of both clubs partway through the 2022–23 season due to financial insolvency, and their subsequent relegation to the bottom of the league pyramid for the 2023–24 season, after their appeals were rejected by the RFU.\nTransfers involving London Irish, which finished the 2022–23 season, are documented on this list, although the club will not compete in 2023–24, due to its suspension and relegation prior to the season's start, having failed to provide evidence of sufficient funds."

This also includes current and past pools with historical or architectural importance. It is not intended to include hot springs pools except where actual swimming, as opposed to bathing or wading, is possible.\nOrganized swimming as a competitive sport seems to have emerged in England in the 1830s, after the first indoor swimming pool of some type, at St. George's Baths, was opened in 1828. Swimming was included in the first Olympics of modern times, in Athens in 1896, with competition held in the Bay of Zea at Piraeus, about from the stadium where many events were held. In the 1900 Summer Olympics in Paris, swimming was in the Seine. The 1904 Summer Olympics, the only Olympic games where the yard was the measure for setting racing distances, was held at a lake in Forest Park, in St. Louis, Missouri. The first Olympic swimming pool was used in the 1908 Summer Olympics, in London, outdoors in the infield of White City Stadium (demolished in 1985).\nIn modern times, an Olympic pool may be used for a competition, and then moved to be used elsewhere. This what happened with pools at the Olympic Aquatics Stadium and the Maria Lenk Aquatic Center of the 2016 Summer Olympics: these were transformed into four 50 meter pools in Manaus (4000 km west of Rio), Salvador de Bahia (1600 km north), Guarantiguetà (250 km west) and Fortaleza de São João (20 km away within Rio). And for the 2028 Summer Olympics, a baseball stadium in Los Angeles will be modified into a temporary aquatics venue to host the swimming, synchronized swimming and diving events.\nWorld Aquatics (Previously FINA) sets standards for swimming pools used in international competitions. Its requirements are not met by many \"Olympic-sized\" pools; for example of the 15 or more Olympic-sized pools in the Philippines, only the one at New Clark City Aquatics Center is FINA-certified. FINA's requirement that a pool must be 2 meters deep (with 3 meters recommended) is met by some pools elsewhere being adjustable in depth at their shallow ends, such for the competition pool in Tromsø, Norway.\nSpecialization of Kenya, other East African countries in track, of Cuba in boxing, has been attributed by some to their lack of investment in pools and other athletic facilities. There have been numerous calls within countries for Olympic level facilities, e.g. Kenya below, even in developed nations such as Canada, where the capital region around Ottawa is deemed to be under-served. Just as it is hard for a tropical nation to develop what's needed to be competitive in bobsled, so is it difficult for many nations to afford the upfront and high continuing costs of Olympic pools, given other needs.\nIn recent years, there has been possibility for some third world countries to obtain needed investment through China's Belt and Road program.\n\"Chinese construction companies also helped the Government of Kenya build a US$52 million sports stadium with a seating capacity of 60,000 people, an Olympic-size swimming pool, and a modern gymnasium to host the fourth All-Africa games ...\" Plan for initiative to build an Olympic stadium in Kuwait.\nNo instances of Western nations constructing aquatic centers in Third World countries come to mind. In some cases, competition-level facilities were built for an Olympics or other international competition, only to fall quickly into disrepair. That appears to have happened in Kenya and more recently in Rio de Janeiro. For the latter, however, plans were in place to repurpose some of its pools to other locations, and more repurposing ended up being done given deteriorating conditions of arenas.\nSwimming pools, worldwide, are numerous. For the facilities that have actually been used in an Olympics, see List of Olympic venues in swimming. For very large ones, see List of largest swimming pools.\nFacilities by nation include:\nAlgeria.\nPiscine du Complexe Olympique, Algiers, used in 2007 All-Africa Games. The 1978 All-Africa Games were also held in Algiers.\nCanada.\n50 m pools in Canada, from west to east, include:\nBritish Columbia:\nAlberta:\nManitoba:\nOntario: Toronto\nOntario: Ottawa\nOntario: Guelph\nQuebec: Montreal:\nKenya.\nNote: 1985 call in the National Assembly for an Olympic pool, among other facilities, so we are not limited to track events.\nNorway.\nNorway has four \"Olympic-sized\" pools, including:\nOther pools include:\nPakistan.\n\"Unfortunately, in Pakistan there is actually a lack of swimming pools and facilities. There is only one swimming pool in the entire country of international quality, ... At the age of thirteen, she became Pakistan's first female Olympic swimmer at the 2004 Summer Olympic games.\"\nPhilippines.\nThere were 15 Olympic-sized ( pools and more being built, as of 2019, in the Philippines, and about 20 other 50-meter pools.\nUnited Kingdom.\nThe UK has numerous Olympic-size pools itemized in List of long course swimming pools in the United Kingdom. Selected ones from that list, and other notable pools of the UK include:"

After a successful debut at the 2020 Summer Olympics, the mixed relay competition will remain in the triathlon program for the second time.\nFormat.\nThe Olympic triathlon contains three components; a swim, cycle, and a run. The competitions take the form of a single event between all competitors with no heats.\nThe mixed team event features teams of four (two men and two women). Each athlete performs a triathlon of swim, cycle, and a run in a relay format.\nQualification.\nThe qualification period commenced on 27 May 2022 and will conclude on the same day in 2024. 110 athletes (55 for each gender) will vie for the coveted spots with a maximum of three per gender for each NOC. As the host country, France automatically receives four quota places (two per gender) while the highest-ranked eligible NOC will each obtain two men's and two women's spots at the 2022 and 2023 Mixed Relay World Championships.\nSix highest-ranked eligible NOCs will be awarded two quota places per gender based on the World Triathlon Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification Rankings of 25 March 2024, with two more from the Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification Event to be held between 15 April to 27 May 2024. The qualification period concludes with the top 26 individuals per gender securing a coveted place, subject to the limit of three per NOC and ignoring the first two from each NOC that qualified through the mixed relays. One additional spot for each continent will be allocated to the highest-ranked male and female triathlete from the NOC not yet qualified for the Games. The final two spots per gender are awarded to the triathletes under the Tripartite Commission and to those eligible in the top 180 of the World Triathlon individual rankings.\nSchedule.\nAll dates use Central European Time (UTC+2). \"All event times are subject to change\".

        "text": "This article details the qualifying phase for triathlon at the 2024 Summer Olympics. The competition at these Games will comprise a total of 110 athletes coming from their respective NOCs with a maximum of three per gender. All athletes must undergo a qualifying pathway to earn a spot for the Games through the World Triathlon Mixed Relay Championships (2022 and 2023), the Olympic Qualification Event, the Continental Qualification, and the Olympic Qualification List which began on 27 May 2022 and then concludes two years later on the same date.\nSummary.\nTen NOCs will each earn four quota spots (two per gender) through the mixed relay qualification pathway. As the host country, France reserves four quota places (two per gender) while the highest-ranked eligible NOC will each obtain two men's and two women's spots at the 2022 and 2023 Mixed Relay World Championships. The six highest-ranked NOCs will be allocated the same number of places based on the World Triathlon mixed relay rankings of 25 March 2024 with the remaining two teams notching the Olympic quota places through the Mixed Relay Olympic Qualification Event to be held between 15 April to 27 May 2024.\nThe individual rankings of 27 May 2024 will provide 31 athletes in each gender with the coveted quota places. Twenty-six of them will be sequentially allocated to the highest-ranked triathletes, subject to a limit of three per NOC (if all three are placed inside the top 30) or two per NOC (if the third would be placed outside the top 30). Any NOC qualifying through the mixed relay must ignore its two highest-ranked triathletes in each gender. One additional spot per continent will be assigned to the highest-ranked remaining triathlete whose NOC has not yet qualified for any quota places. A team consisting of two individuals in both the men's and women's events will be eligible to join the ten previously qualified teams in the mixed relay event.\nThe final two spots per gender are awarded to the triathletes under the Tripartite Commission and to those eligible in the top 180 of the World Triathlon individual rankings."

        "text": "The Latta Park Baseball Field was a ballpark located in Latta Park in Charlotte, North Carolina. Its capacity was approximately 1,000 for baseball.\nEdward Dilworth Latta, Mayor F. B. McDowell, and others formed the Charlotte Consolidated Construction Company (the \"Four Cs\") in 1890 to develop the Dilworth neighborhood of Charlotte. To attract visitors and residents, the Four Cs constructed an electric trolley route at the end of which they built a recreational area called Latta Park with gardens, walking paths, a lake, and playing fields including the Latta Park Baseball Field.\nThe first game was played at the park's grand opening on May 20, 1891 with a game between teams from Winston, North Carolina and Columbia, South Carolina. A grandstand for the baseball field was built in 1892, and the field renovated and rededicated in September 1897. As of 1899, a third of a mile bicycle track encircled the playing field.\nLatta Park Baseball Field was home to the Charlotte Hornets minor-league baseball team until the opening of Wearn Field in 1912.\nThe first college football game in Charlotte was played at Latta Park in 1892 when the University of North Carolina defeated Virginia Tech 32-5.\nDavidson College played football games at the Latta Park Baseball Field between 1896 and 1903.\nOn November 28, 1901, Clemson defeated the University of North Carolina in football at Latta Park in front of 1,000 fans.\nCharlotte and Latta Park hosted the Brooklyn Dodgers for spring training in 1896, 1897, and 1901; the Philadelphia Phillies in 1899 and 1900; and the Philadelphia Athletics in 1902.\nAs the Dilworth neighborhood grew, the Four Cs made plans to redevelop recreational areas of Latta Park. The Charlotte Hornets had played at Latta Park through the 1908 season but moved to the newly opened Wearn Field constructed and managed by the team's owner, J.H. Wearn. The Charlotte Baseball Association had signed a ten year lease to utilize Latta Park's Baseball Field and played games at Latta Park through the 1912 season.\nLatta Park is commemorated at Charlotte's Truist Field along the outer wall of South Graham Street."

        "text": "The 2022–23 Michigan State Spartans men's ice hockey season was the 81st season of play for the program and 32nd in the Big Ten. The Spartans represented Michigan State University in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, played their home games at the Munn Ice Arena and were coached by Adam Nightingale in his first season.\nSeason.\nAfter spending the previous decade as a moribund program, there were few expectations for Michigan State in Adam Nightingale's first season behind the bench. The Spartans were picked to finish last in the preseason poll, a common result for the team in recent years. Defying expectations, MSU got off to a decent start and posted a winning record over the first month of the season. The big test for the team would come from within their conference as the Big Ten was the strongest league in the nation in 2023. The Spartans stumbled at the start but went 5–1 against Big Ten opponents in November, including a sweep of #10 Ohio State, which earned the team their first appearance in the national polls in three years.\nNot everything was clear sailing, however. During the game against Ohio State on November 11, Kamil Sadlocha was given a game misconduct for yelling a racial slur at Jagger Joshua. The Big Ten supported the match penalty but, due to a lack of incontrovertible evidence, would not add any additional punishment. Because of the lack of action from either Ohio State or the Big Ten, Joshua went public with the incident a week later. Though Jagger did not name the offending player, Sadlocha was the only one to receive a match penalty in the game. After the full account of the incident was reported, the Ohio State athletic department sent Sadlocha home for an indeterminate time.\nBy the beginning of December, Michigan State was near the top of the conference standings and was ranked among the top 10 teams for the NCAA tournament. Staring at what would be their first trip to the tournament in over a decade, Michigan State's season began to unravel. Over an 8-game stretch that was spread out due to the winter break, Michigan State went 1–7. Because seven of those games came against a nationally ranked team, MSU didn't fall out of NCAA tournament contention but they were placed right on the edge of the bubble. Michigan State continued to stub their toes in the second half and ended the year with a .500 record.\nWhen the conference tournament began, Michigan State sat at #19 in the tournament rankings and needed a good performance in the playoffs to climb back above the cut line. Knowing that they needed to win to save their season, MSU was in for a fight with Notre Dame. The Irish were only a few spots ahead of the Spartans and could not afford to lose for their own postseason chances. The Spartans came out firing in the first game, sending 36 shots on goal, but were unable to solve the Big Ten's top goaltender, Ryan Bischel. It wasn't until the 28th minute of game 2 that Michigan State was able to get their first goal but when it came it opened the floodgates. MSU scored 4 consecutive markers to take the rematch, the program's first playoff victory since 2015, and set up a deciding game 3. With both team playing for their seasons, Dylan St. Cyr had his best performance as a Spartan and stopped 37 shots in a 4–2 victory for the Spartans.\nThe win put Michigan State into the top 16, however, because the final spot was reserved for the Atlantic Hockey champion, the Spartans were still outside the playoff picture. If they wanted to reach the NCAA tournament, MSU would have to take down the top team in the nation and they aimed to do just them when they travelled west to face Minnesota. Knowing they had to play a near-perfect game, the Spartans got off to a good start. MSU opened the scoring on the power play before 5 minutes had elapsed and were pressing the Gophers for much of the first 10 minutes. The Spartans made their first mistake in the 13th minute when Viktor Hurtig took a tripping penalty. On the ensuing power play, Minnesota's wealth of talent enabled the Gophers to tie the score and then completely take over the game. Minnesota scored the final 5 goals of the game and skated away with a rather pedestrian victory despite being outshot by MSU.\nDespite just missing out on the tournament, this season could be seen as a success as it was the first non-losing season for Michigan State since 2015.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

The tournament was conducted by the International Sepaktakraw Federation (ISTAF) in collaboration with the South Korea Sepak Takraw Association and the Daejeon Metropolitan Sports Association. Originally, the event was scheduled to be held in October 2019 in Goa, India, but was postponed to 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the venue was also relocated to Daejeon, South Korea.\nThirteen ISTAF membership countries were confirmed to participate, making it the lowest number of participating nations since the tournament's inception in 2011. The game consisted of three categories, including men's, women's, and mixed, of which the first two categories were conducted in the group tournament ranking system and were additionally divided into two events: regu and quadrant, while the mixed only happened in the quadrant event and was played in the round-robin system. Due to a large number of participating teams, the men's category was further divided based on the previous tournament's performances into two divisions, including Division 1 (D1) and the Premier Division (PM).\nThailand won the tournament with four gold medals in all of the premier division's events they participated in, followed by the United States, which won all of the two events in the division 1 segment, and India was ranked third by winning one in the mixed quadrant.\nHistory.\nAfter the completion of the 2017 ISTAF World Cup in Hyderabad, India, the secretary-general and director-general of the International Sepaktakraw Federation (ISTAF), Dato Abdul Halim Bin Khader, announced the hosting of the following tournament in Goa, India, at a press conference held in February at the chamber of Sports Authority of Telangana State (SATS) with the support of the Government of Telangana and the Telangana State Olympic Association, but the date has not yet been finalized. However, due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the tournament was later postponed indefinitely.\nSince the outbreak condition has improved, the ISTAF has sought a host for the tournament's third edition, in which South Korea interested. The MOU agreement ceremony to organize the event between the International Sepak Takraw Federation, Daejeon Metropolitan City, the Daejeon Metropolitan Sports Association, and the Korea Sepaktakraw Association, happened on September 28, 2022, at Daejeon Metropolitan City Hall, making it the first international Sepaktakraw tournament to be held in Korea after the 2017 Cittaslow International Sepaktakraw Tournament in Jeonju. The competition formats were also unveiled at the aforementioned occasion. More than 400 athletes from 15 countries were expected to participate in the tournament, which would be held from November 25-29, 2022, at the Daejeon Hanbat Sports Complex in the city of Daejeon."

        "text": "The 2022–23 Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey season was the 60th season of play for the program and 10th in the Big Ten Conference. The Buckeyes represented the Ohio State University in the 2022–23 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season, were coached by Steve Rohlik in his 10th season, and played their home games at Value City Arena.\nSeason.\nAfter tragically missing the NCAA tournament last season, Ohio State entered this season with high expectations. With last years freshman phenom, Jakub Dobeš, as well as star defenseman Mason Lohrei both returning to the lineup, the team's only real question was who would replace the one-and-done Georgii Merkulov as the Buckeye's biggest offensive threat. Senior center Jake Wise initially stepped to the fore but he was eventually joined by another freshman, Stephen Halliday. Neither Wise nor Halliday had the scoring acumen to be big goal scorers but the playmaking centers helped their teammates post solid numbers, aptly replacing the lost offense.\nOhio State started off the season in good standing, going undefeated in the first 5 games. In the 5th match, however, team captain Gustaf Westlund was felled by an injury that would keep him out of the lineup for over 5 months. In the wake of that loss, the team had one of its worst performance all season and were trounced by Connecticut. They bounced back afterwards and posted three more victories, including a defeat of #1 Minnesota, to run their record to 7–2–1 in the first month of the season.\nAfter taking a week off, the team returned to the ice with a showdown against a surprising Michigan State squad. Unfortunately, that where the team was forced to deal with something they had not prepared for. In the game on November 11, Kamil Sadlocha was given a game misconduct for yelling a racial slur at Jagger Joshua. The Big Ten supported the match penalty but, due to a lack of incontrovertible evidence, would not add any additional punishment. Because of the lack of action from either Ohio State or the Big Ten, Joshua went public with the incident a week later. Though Jagger did not name the offending player, Sadlocha was the only one to receive a match penalty in the game. After the full account of the incident was reported, the Ohio State athletic department sent Sadlocha home for an indeterminate time. He eventually returned to the team in late January but finished out the remainder of his senior season without registering another point.\nIn the meantime, Ohio State struggled through a bad patch in November and went 2–6 over an 8-game span. While most of those losses were to ranked team, only being able to earn a split at Long Island damaged the team's postseason hopes and had them on the outside of the NCAA picture for a brief time. By December, the team appeared to recover their earlier form and a 6-game winning streak cured many of the Buckeyes' ills. Ohio State performed adequately in the second half of the season, finishing slightly below .500 but managed to take the regular season series from Michigan for the first time in 3 years.\nWhen the Buckeyes entered the postseason, they were sitting 10 in the PairWise ranking and were virtually guaranteed an NCAA tournament berth if they could reach the semifinals. Their opponent in the quarterfinals was a collapsing Penn State team who graciously forgot how to score in the best of three series. Ohio State had troubles of their own but the Buckeyes were able to win two of the games and advance. While the team was outplayed by Michigan in the semifinal, losing a closer game than a 3–7 score would indicate, The Buckeyes were still in the top 10 in the national rankings and easily made the NCAA tournament. While they had finished with a worse record than they had the year before, Ohio State had played a far more difficult schedule and weren't punished as much for those losses.\nWhile the team was ranked 8th, tied with Penn State, Ohio state had a slightly lower ranking and were given a 3 seed. Additionally, because they could not play their own conference in the first round, the Buckeyes were set against #7 Harvard for their opening game. The unfavorable seeding was supposed to have the Crimson as the favorites to reach the quarterfinals but the Buckeyes didn't take any notice. From the start of the game, Ohio State was in complete control. The scarlet and grey shut down the high-scoring Harvard offense in the first two periods, allowing just 8 shots to reach Dobeš, all of which he stopped. The Buckeyes, on the other hand, peppered the Harvard goal with a barrage, recording 34 shots in just 40 minutes. The Buckeyes netted two markers in the first but broke through with a 5-goal avalanche in the second to take an insurmountable 7–0 lead into the third. After an 8th goal early, Ohio State just sat back and played defense for the rest of the game. Harvard was finally able to get on the board late by that didn't affect the outcome of the game and the Buckeyes rolled to a 8–1 triumph.\nThings appeared to be heading in the same direction in their next game when Joe Dunlap squeaked a goal through Yaniv Perets just 91 seconds into the game. However, after that the Buckeyes were totally stymied by the All-American goaltender and could not get another goal. Despite outshooting the Bobcats, Ohio Sate fell 1–4 to Quinnipiac, ending their season with a solid if unfulfilling campaign.\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "List of FIS Alpine Ski World Cup Nations Cup standings",
        "text": "This is a list of the Nations Cup standings in FIS Alpine Ski World Cup from 1967 to present.\nStandings.\nThe Nations Cup standings are calculated by adding up all points each season for all racers from a given nation.\nThe early years of the World Cup, ‘67 through ‘72, were dominated by the French, as reflected in their Nations Cup wins in 5 of the first 6 years. The Austrian team then took over throughout the rest of the 1970s, followed by Swiss superiority during most of the 1980s. A resurgent Austrian team charged back to the top in 1988, beginning a long streak of consecutive Nations Cup triumphs. Austrian dominance reached its zenith in the late 1990s and 2000s (decade), when their points total regularly doubled that of the second-place finisher, and was capped in the 1999–2000 and 2003–4 seasons with totals that tripled those of runner-up Italy. Their 17927-point total in 1999–2000 is a Nations Cup record, as is their 12066-point margin of victory in 2003–4.\nAs of the end of the 2016–17 season, the Austrian team has won 30 consecutive Nations Cups, while topping the men's standings for 25 straight years. Austria is the only nation to have finished in the top 3 of the Nations Cup standings in all 50 years in which World Cup competition has been held, winning in 38 of those years, runner-up in 11 years, and third place in a single year. Austrian men have failed to make the podium in only one season: 1972. Austrian women have failed to make the podium in only 2 seasons: 1981 and 1982. Switzerland with 10 wins and France with 5 wins are the only other nations to have won the nations cup. In the midst of the ongoing Austrian juggernaut, the Swiss or Italian teams have usually held second place. The German team reached the runner-up spot for the first time in 1997–8, as did the Norwegians the next season. The US enjoyed its best placings ever starting in 2004–5, grabbing second in the Nations Cup for two straight years.\nUnder the current scoring system (since 1992), the winning nation (Austria every year) has averaged over 13000 points, with an average of over 6400 for the runner-up, 5400 for third place, 4200 for fifth, and 1300 for tenth. The all-inclusive scoring system (simply adding together all World Cup points earned) favors national teams with great depth and many racers scoring World Cup points, and even teams with several top racers have no realistic chance of breaking the Austrian grip on the top spot, while a team with only one or two top-ranked racers will struggle to ever break the top five in the standings. There have been numerous calls for a revamped scoring system which would allow other nations to compete more readily for top spots in the Nations Cup, but no changes are likely to be made. In 2016, however, the Austrian men's team narrowly beat France by just 201 points.\nThe total number of top-three placings for each nation in the Nations Cup (through the 2022–23 season) are summarized below:"

He made his professional debut in 2018 with the Dominican Summer League Royals, playing in 10 games and hitting .325 with 3 RBI. Hernández split the 2019 season between the rookie–level Arizona League Royals and rookie–level Burlington Royals, accumulating a .278/.319/.330 with one home run and 20 RBI across 42 games. He did not play in a game in 2020 due to the cancellation of the minor league season because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHernández returned to action in 2021 with the Single–A Columbia Fireflies, also playing in five games for the rookie–level Arizona Complex League Royals. In 74 games for Columbia, he hit .274/.355/.335 with one home run, 19 RBI, and 34 stolen bases.

On November 15, 2022, the Royals added Hernández to their 40-man roster to protect him from the Rule 5 draft.\nOn February 25, 2023, Hernández suffered a dislocation in his right shoulder while attempting a diving catch during a spring training game. The next day, it was announced he would miss three-to-four months with the injury. He was later optioned to the Double-A Northwest Arkansas Naturals on March 10. After spending the entirety of the season on the injured list, Hernández was activated and optioned to the High–A Quad Cities River Bandits on July 3. The Royals non-tendered him on November 17, but re-signed him to a minor league contract the following day."

As with other leagues, once a team retires a player's jersey number, it never issues the number to any other player, unless the player or team explicitly allows it.\nHistory.\nSince NCAA teams began retiring numbers, many players have had their jersey number retired. Duke University and Murray State University have the most retired numbers among Division I programs, with 13 each. Unlike professional leagues, no one player has had his number retired by two teams.\nSome programs such as Indiana, Kansas, Syracuse, Oklahoma State, Georgetown, Stanford, Maryland, or Baylor, have not officially retired jersey numbers yet. Unlike major sports leagues in the United States such as MLB (which retired Jackie Robinson's number 42) and the NHL (which did so for Wayne Gretzky's 99), the NCAA has never retired a jersey number league-wide in honor of anyone.\nNevertheless, there are some cases of retirement of a same number honoring two different players, such as the University of Texas at El Paso, which retired number 14 worn first by Bobby Joe Hill (1961–1966) and then by Nate \"Tiny\" Archibald (1967–70)."

        "text": "The 2023 Tour de France is the 110th edition of the Tour de France. It started in Bilbao, Spain on 1 July and will end with the final stage at Champs-Élysées, Paris on 23 July.\nStage 1.\nThe first stage around Bilbao in the Basque Country saw a crash of several riders, which ultimately forced two pre-race favourites, Richard Carapaz () and Enric Mas (), to abandon. It was later determined Carapaz had fractured his patella. The race broke into several groups over the two final climbs of the day, with identical twins Adam Yates () and Simon Yates () breaking away from a select group on the final ascent. The pair held their advantage to the finish, with Adam Yates taking the stage win and the first leader's yellow jersey ahead of his brother. Two-time winner Tadej Pogačar () won the sprint in the group behind to finish third, and Neilson Powless () took the lead in the mountains classification.\nStage 2.\nStage 2 featured the climb of the Jaizkibel, prominently used in the race Clásica de San Sebastián later in the season. On the climb, a select group of favourites emerged ahead of the peloton, with Pogačar taking eight bonus seconds available at the summit ahead of defending champion Jonas Vingegaard (). Victor Lafay () broke clear of the leading group within the final kilometre of the stage and managed to keep his advantage to win the stage ahead of defending green jersey winner Wout van Aert (), while Yates retained the yellow jersey.\nStage 3.\nOn stage 3 into Bayonne, Jasper Philipsen () came in ahead of Phil Bauhaus (), following a strong lead-out by teammate Mathieu van der Poel. Yates remained in the leader's jersey while Powless collected more points for the mountains classification as part of the breakaway.\nStage 4.\nOn stage 4, Philipsen won ahead of Caleb Ewan () and Bauhaus in a sprint finish at the Circuit Paul Armagnac in Nogaro. The final part of the stage was marred by several crashes, including Fabio Jakobsen (), while Yates retained the yellow jersey for another day. Following two hard opening days and with the high mountains of the Pyrenees to come the day after, the field took a slow tempo during stage 4, with no breakaway forming until into the race. This led to criticism, with some, such as stage winner Philipsen, describing it as \"the most boring Tour de France stage for a long time\".\nStage 5.\nOn Stage 5, the first mountain stage in the Pyrenees, a substantial breakaway group of 17 riders emerged, including several pre-race favorites. This breakaway, which included Jai Hindley (), his teammate Emanuel Buchmann, Giulio Ciccone, Wout van Aert, former world champion Julian Alaphilippe (), and Austrian climber Felix Gall (), gained an advantage over the main peloton and maintained a consistent lead. The breakaway's maximum lead over the peloton was four minutes, and it remained at around 2:30 minutes as the riders approached the final climb of the day, the Col de Marie-Blanque.\nDuring the ascent of the Col de Marie-Blanque, Gall and Hindley, who had accumulated enough points to secure the mountains classification lead, broke away from the breakaway group. Hindley managed to drop Gall and proceeded to ride solo over the top of the climb and to the finish line in Laruns, securing the stage victory and taking the lead in the general classification.\nIn the pursuing group of favorites, \"Vingegaard\" launched an attack 1.5 km (0.93 mi) from the summit of the Marie-Blanque. This move allowed him to distance \"Pogačar\". As Vingegaard caught up to Gall, Buchmann, and Ciccone on the descent, he secured a fifth-place finish on the stage, crossing the finish line 34 seconds behind Hindley. \"Pogačar\" tried to limit his losses, waiting for his distanced teammate \"Adam Yates\", and eventually crossed the finish line 1:04 minutes behind Vingegaard, causing him to drop to sixth place overall. Other contenders like \"Gaudu, Martinez, Rodriguez, and the Yates brothers\" also finished together with Pogačar. Meanwhile, \"Ben O'Connor\" and \"Romain Bardet\" lost 1:57 minutes to Hindley.\nStage 6.\nThe first mountain finish of the Tour occurred on Stage 6 in Cauterets-Cambasque. A breakaway of twenty riders formed, which included van Aert and Powless. This breakaway enabled Powless to regain the lead in the mountains classification. During the ascent of the Col du Tourmalet, picked up the pace in the peloton, led by Sepp Kuss to support Vingegaard. As a result, all riders were distanced except for \"Pogačar\". Vingegaard caught up with van Aert, who had dropped back from the lead group to assist his team leader.\nApproximately halfway up the 16 km (9.9 mi) final ascent to Cambasque, a lead-out by Van Aert set the stage for Vingegaard and Pogačar to pull ahead of all other riders. Around 2.5 km (1.6 mi) from the finish, Pogačar launched an acceleration that allowed him to distance Vingegaard. Pogačar secured the stage victory, while Vingegaard finished second, 24 seconds behind. Vingegaard's performance granted him the coveted yellow jersey of the race leader, holding a 25-second advantage over Pogačar in the general classification. The previous overnight leader, Hindley, who had fallen behind on the Tourmalet climb, experienced a significant time loss and dropped to third place overall, trailing Vingegaard by 1:34 minutes.\nStage 7.\nStage 7 was a flat stage ending in a bunch sprint in Bordeaux. The sprint was won by Philipsen again, narrowly beating Mark Cavendish (), whose bicycle gears slipped within metres of the finish line.\nStage 8.\nStage 8 put an end to Cavendish's attempt to break the record for most stage wins, as an injury sustained in a crash forced him to abandon the Tour; the stage was won in a sprint by Mads Pedersen.\nStage 9.\nThe Tour returned to the Puy de Dôme for the first time since 1988, with a summit finish. A 14-man breakaway emerged early; late in the stage, Matteo Jorgenson () broke away from the breakaway and led the race alone for most of the last 47 km before being overtaken in the last 500 metres by Michael Woods (Israel–Premier Tech), who won the stage at the top of the Puy de Dôme. Vingegaard retained the yellow jersey, but lost time to Pogačar, who crossed the finish line eight seconds ahead of him.\nStage 10.\nAfter the first rest day, stage 10 had a chaotic beginning, with many groups of riders—at one point including Vingegaard and Pogačar—attempting to break away before being caught by the peloton; a stable breakaway emerged around the halfway point of the stage. Krists Neilands (Israel–Premier Tech), attacked the breakaway group and was solo leader for much of the last section of the stage, but was eventually caught by other breakaway riders including Pello Bilbao (Team Bahrain Victorious), who went on to win the stage. Bilbao dedicated his victory to his late teammate Gino Mäder, who had died after a crash in the Tour de Suisse the previous month.\nStage 11.\nJasper Philipsen took his fourth stage-win of the Tour in a sprint on the eleventh stage to Moulins."

Pogačar cut Vingegaard's lead to nine seconds.\nStage 14.\nAn early 13-rider crash led race officials to suspend the stage for 30 minutes and caused several riders to abandon the Tour. On the climb to the Col de Joux Plane, Pogačar and Vingegaard led the stage. Pogačar attacked about from the top of the climb, but Vingegaard recovered and caught up with him; Pogačar's next attack was stymied by media motorcycles crowding the road. Carlos Rodríguez (Ineos Grenadiers) caught Vingegaard and Pogačar during the final descent and went on to win the stage, moving one second ahead of Jai Hindley into third place overall.\nStage 15.\nWout Poels (Team Bahrain Victorious) soloed to victory after he broke away from the finish line on the penultimate climb of the Côtes des Amerands. It was his first Tour de France stage win.\nStage 16.\nAfter the second rest day, stage 16 was the only individual time trial of the Tour, 22.4 km between Passy and Combloux. \nPogačar aimed to reverse the 10 second lead of Vingegaard, but the latter won stage 16 decisively and widened his lead to 1 minute and 48 seconds. Pogačar came in second, over a minute ahead of Vingegaard's teammate van Aert, while Adam Yates moved into third place in the general classification, ahead of Rodriguez.\nStage 17.\nOn stage 17, a fierce counter-attack from Pogačar was expected. However, Pogačar needed assistance from his teammate Marc Soler in the climb towards the Col de la Loze and lost further time to Vingegaard, who widened the lead to more than seven minutes in a stage won by Felix Gall (AG2R Citroën Team).\nStage 18.\nKasper Asgreen (Soudal Quick-Step) held off the competition to win the eighteenth stage, which entered the Rhone valley. Meanwhile, Wout van Aert left the race to be with his wife, who was about to give birth.\nStage 19.\nOn stage 19, Matej Mohorič (Team Bahrain Victorious) won by the width of a rim to beat Asgreen in a photo finish in Poligny. After winning the stage, Mohorič paid tribute to his late teammate Gino Mäder, who died in a crash at in the Tour de Suisse in June.\nStage 20.\nIn the twentieth stage, Thibaut Pinot, in his last Tour before retirement, attacked the breakaway and was solo leader at the top of the Petit Ballon, which was lined by thousands of fans cheering him on. He was overtaken and dropped by the race leaders on the ascent to the Col du Platzerwasel, and Pogačar won the stage ahead of Gall and his tour rival Vingegaard. In the same stage, the Italian Giulio Ciccone (Lidl–Trek) sealed the victory for the mountain classification. He was the first Italian to achieve this feat since Claudio Chiappucci in 1992.\nStage 21.\nThe final stage was traditionally calm and the Belgian Jordi Meeus won just ahead of his compatriot Philipsen, Groenewegen, and Pedersen. \nPhilipsen won the green jersey of the points classification for the first time in his career. Vingegaard crossed the finish line at the Champs-Élysées arm in arm with his teammates, finishing 7:29 minutes ahead of Pogačar and 10:56 minutes ahead of Adam Yates to win the Tour de France for the second straight year. His winning margin of 7 minutes 29 seconds was the largest since 2014. Vingegaard's Team Jumbo–Visma won the teams classification. Victor Campenaerts was chosen as the most combative rider. Runner up Pogačar won the white jersey of the young rider classification for the fourth year in a row."

Jackson argues that since female athletes are underpaid compared to their male counterparts, even those who go pro need to prepare for other careers, as well.\nSeveral of her players went on to sign professional contracts, including Tressa Beckel, Jasmin Dixon, Zondranika Williams, and Kafayat Davies.\nIn 2017–18, Chicago State's women's basketball team set a Division I record for the most consecutive losses. Jackson was fired in 2018 for underperformance, although the \"New York Times\" reported that the failing finances of Chicago State made it too difficult for her to attract and retain players."

Three teams who finish on the podium qualify for the Olympics through the 2022 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships in Liverpool with a large proportion of quota places distributed at the same meet in Antwerp, Belgium by the following year. The 2024 World Cup series will also hand the gymnasts an opportunity to earn more spots in separate apparatus events.\nIn rhythmic gymnastics, the 2022 World Championships, held from 14 to 18 September in Sofia, Bulgaria, witnessed individual and group all-around medalists book their tickets in Paris. Most quota places will be allocated at the same meet in Valencia, Spain by the following year with fourteen individual gymnasts and five nations across all continents vying for qualification.\nHalf of the trampoline qualifying slots will be awarded to the highest-ranked gymnasts at the 2023 World Championships in Birmingham with the majority coming from the 2023–2024 World Cup series. Across all gymnastics disciplines, the remaining places will be offered to the gymnasts vying for qualification at their respective continental meets."

The video referee awarded the try, as Marshall did not put a foot in touch before grounding the ball. Harry Smith missed the conversion.\nOn 19 minutes, Leeds were awarded a scrum, after a knock on from Wigan, but the referee gave a penalty to Wigan, due to interference at the scrum. Smith opted to go for goal, but the kick was wide, and the score remained 4-0.\nWith 5 minutes of the first half remaining, Leeds were awarded a penalty 10 metres out, to which Zak Hardaker kicked the goal, and bring Leeds back to within 2 points heading into half time.\n5 minutes into the 2nd half, Leeds got their first try of the game, through Jarrod O'Connor, with Hardaker successful with the conversion, to give Leeds an 8-4 lead.\n3 minutes later, Leeds scored again, with a try from James Bentley.

While badminton is not a popular sport in Uruguay, it has been gaining popularity after the country entered the Shuttle Time program organized by the Badminton World Federation. \nUruguay first competed in the South American Badminton Championships in 1985. Uruguay later qualified for a second time in 1988 when it hosted the championships. The last time the team ever competed in the championships was in 1996. \nHistory.\nIt is not known when badminton first set foot in Uruguay. In one interview, the interviewee claims that the sport was first played by attachés in embassies, especially in Germany and the sport later spread in popularity and Uruguayans started to get involved in badminton.\nIn another interview, the interviewee stated that the first president of the Uruguay Badminton Federation, Enrique Collerati bought badminton books, rackets with other equipment including shuttlecocks and began inviting experienced badminton players from Mexico to play badminton in a shed he had around the corner. After that, he had the idea of forming the Uruguay Badminton Federation in 1985. Around that time, the nation began hosting its first national championships and soon competed in the 1985 South American Badminton Championships.\nIn the 2000s, badminton began to fade away in popularity in the country and the Uruguay Badminton Federation was disbanded. In 2016, with the help of Badminton Pan America and the Badminton World Federation, Shuttle Time courses were held and organized as an attempt to revive badminton in Uruguay. \nMixed team.\nThe Uruguayan mixed team debuted in the South American Badminton Team Championships in 1985. The team finished in third place. In 1988, the Uruguayan mixed team finished in fourth place in the round robin tournament at the 1988 South American Team Championships.\nStaff.\nThe following list shows the coaching staff for the national badminton team of Uruguay."

It will be the fourth edition of the NWSL Challenge Cup tournament.\nThe 2023 NWSL Challenge Cup was the first time the NWSL Challenge Cup was played concurrently with the regular season, bringing it in line with most other league cup competitions worldwide. It was also the first edition under a multi-year sponsorship with UKG, which increased the pool of prize money to $1 million toward a goal of achieving equal compensation when compared to men's leagues and open cup competitions in the United States.\nFormat.\nThe 2023 NWSL Challenge Cup was a multi-stage tournament. All 12 NWSL teams participated in the Challenge Cup, and the tournament was played concurrently with the regular season. The tournament was split into three groups of four teams each, and each team played a six-game double round-robin with its group. Following the group stage, the top team of each group and the highest-placing group runner-up advanced to the single-elimination semifinals on September 6, with the winners competing in the final on September 9. Matches did not have extra-time periods, and semifinal and final matches drawn during regulation proceeded directly to kicks from the penalty mark.\nPrize money.\nPlayers in the four semifinal teams divide the tournament's $1 million pool of prize money. Sponsor UKG determined a prize pool of that size would draw the tournament's rewards closer to that of the men's MLS is Back tournament, which had a $1.1 million prize pool in 2020. For comparison, the 2022 NWSL Challenge Cup prize pool was estimated to be about or less than $500,000.\nTiebreakers.\nA team's position in the divisional standings was determined by points, with three points awarded for a win, one point for a tie, and zero points for a loss. If two or more teams in the same group are tied on points at the end of the group stage, the following tiebreaking criteria were applied to determine the final group standings:\nIn the case of two or more teams from different divisions being tied on points at the end of the group stage, the competition follows the same procedure except for the use of the head-to-head scenarios by virtue of the fact teams from different divisions would not have played each other during the group stage.\nGroup stage.\nEast Division.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nCentral Division.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nWest Division.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nRanking of second-placed teams.\nThe best second-placed team from the group stage advances to the knockout stage.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stage, the semifinals occurred on September 6 and the final took place on September 9. \nStatistics.\nGoalscorers.\n\"Statistics do not include penalty-shootout goals.\"\nDiscipline.\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match in the tournament for the following offenses:\nAwards.\nManaka Matsukubo was awarded the MVP of the 2023 NWSL Challenge Cup final match, and Kristen Hamilton was named the overall MVP of the tournament.\nNamed to the All-Tournament team:"

        "title": "2021 Rugby World Cup final",
        "text": "The 2021 Rugby World Cup final was the final match of the 2021 Rugby World Cup, the ninth edition of the women's Rugby World Cup and the seventh organised by World Rugby for women's national rugby union teams. The match was contested between two-time champions England, and hosts and five-time and defending champions New Zealand on 12 November 2022 at Eden Park in Auckland, New Zealand, postponed from the previous year. This was the fifth time that these two nations met in a Rugby World Cup final, following the 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2017 editions. New Zealand won the Rugby World Cup for a record sixth time, beating England 34–31. New Zealand captain Ruahei Demant was named the player of the match.\nBackground.\nThe 2021 Rugby World Cup, the ninth edition of the women's Rugby World Cup, was held in New Zealand between 8 October and 12 November 2022, postponed from 18 September to 18 October 2021. Twelve teams contested the final tournament, playing 26 matches. The top seven placed teams from the 2017 World Cup automatically qualified for the tournament, while the remaining five spots were decided in qualifying rounds between 9 August 2019 and 21 February 2022 from 23 teams.\nTeams were divided into three pools of four teams, with each team playing each other once in a round-robin format. The top two teams in each pool, plus the two best-ranked third-placed teams, qualified for the quarter-finals, the first time the quarter-finals appeared in the Women's World Cup since 2002. Rights to host the final was awarded to Eden Park, the national stadium of New Zealand that had previously hosted men's Rugby World Cup finals in 1987 and 2011, making it the first venue to host finals in men's and women's Rugby World Cups. It also played host to three pool games on opening day, as well as the semi-finals and third place play-off.\nEngland won the tournament on two previous occasions in 1994 and 2014, with New Zealand having won on a record five occasions, in 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010 and 2017. At least one of England and New Zealand have appeared in every Rugby World Cup final, often competing against each other; on only one occasion (the first World Cup in 1991) has neither team been champion. The 2021 final was the 30th match between England and New Zealand. They first played against each other in Burnham, New Zealand, in 1997 where New Zealand won 67–0 (England's biggest defeat); since then, England had won 10 meetings, 18 previous matches were won by New Zealand, and a single game had been drawn in Esher, England, in 2011.\nHaving a long rivalry and being the undisputed strongest teams in the world, the nations met previously in five of the past six World Cups, four of which were finals. The most recent match between them before the 2021 World Cup was played at Franklin's Gardens in Northampton, England, on 7 November 2021, with England winning 56–15 (New Zealand's biggest defeat); they had also played a week earlier, which was at the time New Zealand's biggest defeat. England had won their last 30 test matches, a world record run, since they last lost to New Zealand in July 2019, while New Zealand had been unbeaten since a record four consecutive losses which involved their last two meetings with England. In the World Rugby rankings at the start of the competition, England was ranked first and New Zealand was ranked second.\nRoute to the final.\nEngland.\nEngland qualified automatically for the tournament by world ranking, entering as favourites. They competed in Pool C in the pool stage, against another automatic qualifier in France, and two regional champions, Fiji and South Africa, considered unknown quantities.\nEngland's first pool match was against Fiji. Described as an \"annihilation\", eleven different England players got on the score sheet, though Fiji held their own in the first half, scoring two tries (a third would come at the very end of the match). England's early lead challenged come halftime, but they responded in the second half with ten tries, dominant in possession.\nIn a more competitive match, England next faced France, in a game less exciting than both teams usually deliver. With the pitchside ambulances said to be busier than most of the players in the first half, France went down important players early on and set to defense; England was constantly in attack but unimpressive at finishing. In the final ten minutes, England confirmed their win.\nHaving already confirmed their position at the top of Pool C, England's final match was against South Africa. Winless South Africa needed to defeat England to reach the third position in the pool and potentially advance, but England scored 13 tries to no response; they took the most tries, most points-for, and greatest points difference of all teams in the pool stage.\nIn the knockout stage, England played their quarter-final against Australia, runners-up of their pool. In a match marked by handling errors, England's dominance in the scrum helped them to a confident win, scoring routinely throughout the match, with Australia scoring a single unconverted try just before halftime. England's semi-final saw them play Canada, who had also won their pool, in a more difficult match; though they were never behind in the scores, England became exposed defensively and, uncommonly, in set pieces as Canada played well throughout. England ultimately won by seven points to advance to the final following what \"The Telegraph\" described as \"one of the greatest contests of all time, men's or women's.\"\nNew Zealand.\nNew Zealand qualified automatically for the tournament both as the 2017 champions and as the host nation. They competed in Pool A in the pool stage, against fellow automatic qualifiers Australia and Wales, and European Qualification Tournament runner-up Scotland.\nThe opening game of the tournament saw New Zealand run to a confident win over Australia after falling behind by three tries and 17 points in the first half; two answering tries in the first half, followed by Australia seeing two players sent to the sin bin at the same time at the start of the second half, set up New Zealand for a comeback, scoring a further five tries without Australia getting over the try line again.\nTheir next match saw them defeat Wales in a dominant game; though taking 17 minutes to open scoring, New Zealand scored three more times in the next ten minutes to end the first half 22 points up before Wales responded in the first minute of the second half; New Zealand immediately scored once more, and twice again in the next ten minutes, continuing through the second half. Wales got a second try minutes from full-time, with New Zealand also scoring one last time in response.\nNew Zealand had secured the top position in Pool A before playing its final match, which was against Scotland, considered a much weaker team. Scotland had lost both of its previous matches and would need to defeat New Zealand to come third in the pool, which could lead to advancement depending on the final standings of all pools. New Zealand opened scoring two minutes in, and would score seven tries in the first half; a more subdued second half saw only two New Zealand tries, with Scotland kept off the score sheet completely.\nIn their quarter-final, New Zealand encountered Wales once more, as the second-best third-placed team from the pools. The match played out much like their pool stage meeting, with New Zealand \"demolishing\" Wales, though the team was fierce in defence to prevent a larger points gap. New Zealand's semi-final was a tight match against France, a pool stage runner-up; France opened scoring and though New Zealand responded they were still seven points down at halftime. They took the lead with two second-half tries and a penalty kick, hanging on as France leveled the tries. France went down a player in the 70th minute, but New Zealand failed to capitalise, with France getting the last chance to score, from a penalty kick in the last minute; kicked wide, New Zealand won by a point. \nMatch.\nSummary.\nAt the start of play, England established the dominance they would have in the opening minutes of the game; the first try was scored by English fullback Ellie Kildunne in the third minute and was converted by kicker Emily Scarratt. Play moved to inside the England 22-metre line after restart. Though New Zealand won a penalty in the sixth minute and elected to kick for goal, it did not go over; their subsequent restart escaped the clutches of their right-sided players and went into touch, with play ending up inside New Zealand's 22. Their captain, Ruahei Demant, managed to run the ball into the England half, threatening the defence, until New Zealand conceded a penalty. England chose to take a line-out, kicking close to the try line and winning the throw, then playing a ruck and maul to successfully push over the line for Amy Cokayne to score in the 13th minute, with Scarratt also converting this for England to lead by 14 points in as many minutes.\nPlay returned to New Zealand, with winger Portia Woodman, bolstered by advantage play after an England knock on, running for a try but being pushed into touch near the line by a Lydia Thompson tackle. Woodman stayed down off the pitch as the referee looked to restart play, with England winning the ball off New Zealand and kicking it downfield; medics and video referee intervened in the 17th minute, taking Woodman off due to a head injury and showing that the first point of contact in Thompson's tackle was her head. Thompson was shown a red card and sent off. Ayesha Leti-I'iga replaced Woodman.\nA minute later, New Zealand scored their first try of the match, winning a maul themselves to send Georgia Ponsonby over the line, converted by Renee Holmes. Handling errors then saw New Zealand lose the ball to England, who repeated the play of their second try to score a third, this time by Marlie Packer, though Scarratt missed the conversion. England then knocked on, allowing New Zealand to copy their try attempt; though New Zealand could not push their maul forward this time, a pass wide allowed Leti-I'iga, with space in Thompson's absence, to receive the ball and dive over the line in the 25th minute. Holmes successfully converted the try.\nRestart saw messy play, with both teams losing possession, before England pushed forward by the try line but lost the ball again due to Zoe Aldcroft dropping the ball for a knock on as she went down; play continued with New Zealand opting for a scrum, though medics intervened, assessing the still-down Aldcroft on the pitch before taking her off with a head injury in the 27th minute. She was replaced by Catherine O'Donnell and New Zealand took their scrum. England found some form again, pushing a maul towards the try line before New Zealand players collapsed it, with England then trying to play the advantage with a pass; Holmes intercepted the pass and ran the length of the pitch, eventually grounding the ball, though the referee had been blowing her whistle for the duration to signal to return the ball to England for the maul collapse. England took the penalty with another maul and drove it over the line in the 32nd minute, Cokayne supplying her second try and Scarratt her third conversion.\nEngland continued with strong play for the remainder of the first half, seeing a quick ball return after handling errors by New Zealand and then a penalty from scrum discipline; though England won a line-out by the try line, New Zealand won the ball and began to pass it down their line towards the left. England held them in the centre, but gave away advantage play in the process, and New Zealand eventually got the ball to the left and England's gap in defence for Leti-I'iga to make another run. Though England's defence caught her, New Zealand had the previous advantage and chose to take a line-out; as they pushed their maul towards the try line, Amy Rule spun off the back of it with the ball to cross the line and ground it. In the last touch of the first half, Holmes did not manage the conversion.\nReturning from half time, England replaced captain Sarah Hunter with Poppy Cleall, leaving Scaratt as captain on the pitch. Looking to make further headway into the point deficit, New Zealand made creative plays in the first minute, Stacey Fluhler and Holmes working together to get the ball over in the 41st minute, though Holmes again missed the goal. In play after the restart, Scarratt fought to win the ball back for England, but it was given back to New Zealand after England error. England struggled to regain possession or break forward when they had it and turned to defensive play within their own half as New Zealand continued to push. A New Zealand knock-on gave them some reprise, though also coming with interchanges to freshen the Black Ferns; England failed to kick the ball as they intended and lost possession. They still caused New Zealand problems in the centre, but the Black Ferns passed to the left again and, only a few minutes after coming on, Krystal Murray managed to get the ball over the line in the 49th minute, sending New Zealand into the lead for the first time.\nLucy Packer, England scrum-half who herself was only added to the start list on the morning of the final, was taken off in the 52nd minute, replaced by Claudia MacDonald, just as England set up to take a scrum. New Zealand broke the scrum, conceding the penalty to England, who chose another line-out; in a recreation of their second try, England drove the maul over the line for a third Cokayne try, taking the lead back, though Scarratt missed the conversion. New Zealand's right winger, Ruby Tui, started asserting her position more and began pushing attacks down the pitch, though England responded better on New Zealand's right (their left) side and took the ball back after several unsuccessful plays. A series of mistakes saw possession change hands several times, and several scrums awarded, for about ten minutes around the hour mark. England's Abbie Ward, having taken much of the slack on England's right side (New Zealand's left) after Thompson's early departure, began to noticeably tire and was targeted in attacks, while New Zealand started putting on more replacements and England held out.\nThe deadlock appeared to be broken in the 65th minute as Abby Dow made a long run out for England, but she was pushed out by New Zealand co-captain Kennedy Simon; video referee found that while Simon had hit Dow's head with her own, contact started with her shoulder, and so it was mitigated and Simon was only sent to the sin bin for ten minutes rather than getting sent off. After being helped up by medics, Dow continued to play for a few minutes, before she could be replaced by Tatyana Heard and go off for a head injury assessment; Dow was the only player to pass the assessment and be allowed to return to the pitch, which she did in the 77th minute. MacDonald tried to make the most of equal numbers by pushing down the centre, but slow play saw a power struggle between the teams in the middle of the pitch, with England eventually conceding a line out to New Zealand; the Black Ferns played to their left side to again send Leti-I'iga over for a try, retaking the lead but still failing to convert.\nIn the last ten minutes, New Zealand made their final replacement shortly before England replaced their front line and Simon was reinstated from the sin bin. England made their first asserted attacking play for a while, but lost possession, and Dow came back on for Heard. In the final minutes of the game, England won several penalties in New Zealand's half. With seconds left on the clock, England chose to push for a try rather than kick for goal, which would have tied the scores and taken the match to extra time. They managed to take the line-out close to the try line, but New Zealand challenged for the ball in the air and won it, taking it to the ground to bring end of play.\nDetails.\nNotes:\nAftermath.\nThe early red card to England's Thompson left the team down a player for most of the match before eventually losing; the rest of the team said afterwards that they did not blame her for the loss, with captain Hunter saying it was up to the players on the pitch to deliver and, though the England side \"left no stone unturned, [they] left everything on the pitch\", that New Zealand found a way and they did not. Coach Simon Middleton said in his interview after the match that the red card \"didn't help\", elaborating that it made a tough contest tougher but that he was proud of the England performance and recognised New Zealand's skill. Men's coach Eddie Jones was also asked about it, and compared red cards in recent years to electric car chargers, saying that they are suddenly everywhere and it is no longer impossible to win a match after receiving one early on. Jones also posited \"Who beats New Zealand at Eden Park?\" Former England player Victoria Fleetwood instead opined that the red card was the deciding factor, and that England would have certainly won had it not been given.\nFormer player and World Cup winner Katherine Merchant criticised the medical staff at the game for not immediately removing Dow from the field when she was visibly affected by head injury, with the medics reportedly unsure if she had been unconscious. The Rugby Football Union chief executive Bill Sweeney had questioned the medics at the game on the incident, noting that they said they spent a minute to review footage before taking the player off, with Sweeney arguing that as a precaution players should, and usually are, taken off immediately for the head injury assessment.\nPopular New Zealand news website Stuff argued that, despite criticisms towards some of the major calls by the referees in the game (particularly the head impact caused by a New Zealand player only receiving a yellow card despite the earlier red and a late penalty try not being awarded to England for New Zealand interference by the try line), the officials \"handled the huge occasion with aplomb\"."

        "text": "The Super Bowl XLIV halftime show took place on February 7, 2010, at Sun Life Stadium (now the Hard Rock Stadium) in Miami Gardens, Florida as part of Super Bowl XLIV. The show was headlined by English rock band The Who.\nBackground.\nFollowing the heated controversy surrounding the Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show headlined by Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake in 2004, the NFL sought to avoid similar incidents by inviting legacy rock bands to headline the halftime show. The Who performed a farewell tour in 1982 and had not released new music since their 2006 album \"Endless Wire\", but they were selected for their broad familiarity and appeal to audiences. The Who were the last such act to headline the annual show; the Black Eye Peas were chosen the following year to attract a younger demographic.\nHealth concerns.\nFrontman Roger Daltrey underwent surgery to remove a precancerous growth from his vocal cords in 2009. While the procedure was not publicized until 2011, it is now believed to have affected his vocal performance during the halftime show.\nDevelopment.\nIn conceiving the halftime show visuals, production designer Bruce Rodgers hoped to incorporate elements associated with the United States, the United Kingdom, and what he termed The Who's \"visual vocabulary.\" The modular stage, consisting of a 26-piece main platform and 14 radial video modules surrounding this main platform as a shield, was built by Brian Sullivan of B+R Scenery. Graphics on these video screens were designed by Lee Lodge to coordinate with each number on band's 12-minute setlist. Lighting for the show was programmed at the PRG/Essential Lighting studio in London over a five-day period.\nPromotion.\nThe Who were first announced as the Super Bowl XLIV headliners in November 2009. Weeks before the game, The Who guitarist Pete Townshend revealed the halftime show setlist in an exclusive interview with \"Billboard\" magazine.\nIn February 2010, MTV Games and Harmonix announced that specially recorded versions of songs in the band's setlist would be available to download and play in the \"Rock Band\" video game after the Super Bowl broadcast.\nReception.\nCritical reception.\nIn a review for \"The New York Times\", critic Jon Pareles characterized The Who's rock anthems as well-suited for the stadium setting but noted the older age of the band members was apparent throughout.\nThe Super Bowl XLIV halftime show was nominated for Outstanding Production Design for a Variety or Reality Series at the 62nd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards.\nRetrospective appraisal.\nIn 2023, \"Rolling Stone\" journalist Rob Sheffield ranked the Super Bowl XLIV halftime show as the 26th-best show out of 35 (all shows from 1967 and 1989 were ranked as a single entry). That same year, Brian Moylan of \"Vulture\" ranked the 2010 performance as the 24th-best halftime show since 1993.\nRatings.\nAccording to Nielsen Media Research, Super Bowl XLIV halftime show viewership was 4% lower than overall game viewership.\nMedia.\nDigital sales of the five songs featured in The Who's halftime show setlist increased 400% in the week after the Super Bowl."

        "text": "The swimming competitions at the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris are scheduled to run from 27 July to 9 August 2024. Pool events (27 July to 4 August) will occur at the Paris La Défense Arena, with the two-day marathon swimming (8 to 9 August) staged at Pont Alexandre III through the Seine River.\nEvents.\nSimilar to the 2020 program format, swimming features a total of 37 events (18 each for men and women and 1 mixed event), including two 10 km open-water marathons. The following events were contested (all pool events are long-course, and distances are in meters unless stated):\nSchedule.\nThe swimming program schedule for Paris 2024 will occur in two segments. For the pool events, similar to the case for the 2012 Games, prelims will run in the morning, followed by the semifinal and final sessions in the evening and the night session (due to the substantial fees NBC has paid for rights to the Olympics, the IOC has allowed NBC to have influence on event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible; NBC agreed to a $7.75 billion contract extension on May 7, 2014, to air the Olympics through the 2032 Games and is also one of the major sources of revenue for the IOC). Several significant changes are instituted to the swimming schedule, with the program extending to nine days for the first time as opposed to the regular eight-day format. The extra day would be used to alleviate the schedules of the swimmers who would compete in the individual and relay events at the same period. Moreover, it relieves a packed schedule that witnesses three new events added to the program at the previous Games.\nIn February 2024, a change was announced to the original schedule for Days 5 and 6, after lobbying by the France's swimming governing body to give Leon Marchand a chance to win both the men's 200 metre butterfly and 200 metre breaststroke events.\nQualification.\nIndividual events.\nWorld Aquatics establishes qualifying times for individual events. The time standards consist of two types, namely an \"Olympic \"Qualifying\" Time\" (OQT, colloquially known as the \"A-cut\") and an \"Olympic \"Consideration\" time\" (OCT, colloquially known as the \"B-cut\"). Each country can enter a maximum of two swimmers per event, provided that they meet the (faster) \"qualifying\" time. A country can enter one swimmer per event that meets the \"invitation\" standard. Any swimmer who meets the \"qualifying\" time will be entered into the event for the Games; a swimmer meeting the \"invitation\" standard is eligible for entry allotted by ranking. If a country does not have a swimmer who meets either of the qualifying standards, it may have entered one male and one female. A country that does not receive an allocation spot but enters at least one swimmer achieving a qualifying standard might have entered those with the highest ranking.\nRelay events.\nEach relay event features 16 teams, composed of the following:\nAll athletes entered in individual events can be used in relays, even if they have not achieved the OCT for the corresponding stroke and distance of the relay in which they are entered. Relay teams may compose of additional athletes according to the number of events they have qualified for.\nOpen-water swimming.\nThe men's and women's 10 km races featured 22 swimmers each, three less than those in the Tokyo 2020 roster:"

        "text": "This article details the qualifying phase for swimming at the 2024 Summer Olympics. 852 swimmers will compete in thirty-five swimming pool events at the Games, with forty-four more racing through the 10-kilometre open water marathon. The qualification window for swimming pool events will occur between 1 March 2023 and 23 June 2024.\nQualification summary.\nA National Olympic Committee (NOC) may enter a maximum of two qualified athletes in each individual event, but only if both of them have attained the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT). One athlete per event can potentially enter if they meet the Olympic Consideration Time (OCT), or if the total quota of 852 athletes has not been targeted. NOCs may also permit swimmers regardless of time (one per gender) under a Universality place since they have no swimmers attaining either of the standard entry times (OQT/OCT).\nFor the relays, a maximum of 16 qualifying teams in each event must be permitted to accumulate a total of 112 relay teams; each NOC may enter only one team. The top three teams in each relay race at the 2023 World Aquatics Championships in Fukuoka, Japan will directly book a slot for their corresponding event at the Olympics, while the remaining thirteen vying for qualification per relay race must attain their best time from the heats and finals at the combined 2023 and 2024 meet in Doha.\nNOCs without a swimmer attaining the OQT or invited by World Aquatics through OCT may enter the highest-ranked male and female swimmer based on the Points Table (2024 edition) or one man and one woman if they participate at the 2023 or 2024 World Championships. Similar to the 2020 format, swimmers from NOCs who have achieved the OCT allocated to the universality place may compete in a maximum of two individual pool events, while those without the OQT and OCT are limited to enter only one individual pool event.\nFollowing the end of the qualification window, World Aquatics will assess the number of swimmers who have achieved the OQT, the number of relay-only swimmers, and the number of Universality places, before inviting those with OCT to fulfill the total quota of 852. Additionally, OCT places will be distributed by event according to the position of the World Aquatics Rankings during the qualifying deadline.\nTime standards.\nThe qualifying time standards must be obtained at the 2023 and 2024 World Championships, continental championships, continental swimming meets, national championships and selection trials, and various international meets approved by World Aquatics in the period between 1 March 2023 and 23 June 2024.\nThe following table outlines the qualifying time standards for Paris 2024:\nIndividual events.\nThose who have achieved the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT) or the Olympic Consideration Time (OCT), or have received a Universality place are listed below for each of the following individual events.\nRelay events.\nTeams are qualified by one of the following routes:\nAll athletes entered in individual events can be used in relays, even if they have not achieved the OCT for the corresponding stroke and distance of the relay in which they are entered.\nOpen water events.\nThe men's and women's 10 km races featured 22 swimmers each, three less than those in the Tokyo 2020 roster:"

Alexander Stadium was renovated between 2019 and 2022 and has two permanent stands seating 18,000, with the option of extending to 40,000 for major events.\nOn 11 November 2022, the European Athletic Association (EAA) chose Birmingham at its Council Meeting held in Warsaw, Poland. The British city was selected after the Hungarian capital Budapest pulled out of the bidding. Previously, in June 2022, the EAA had announced that the 2026 European Athletics Championships would be held as a standalone event separate from the multi-sport European Championships, as part of which they last took place in 2018 and 2022."

        "text": "The is a system that allows players to be held for the purpose of training players separately from the 70 registered players under control of each team created in the fall of at Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB).\nSummary.\nThis system was established in 2005 to create an environment in which amateur players can newly play in the situation where company-owned amateur baseball teams were being abolished one after another. A is a player who aims to improve baseball skill training and manner training in order to aim for registered players under control, that is eligible to participate in NPB's first league official game (Central League, Pacific League, Interleague play (NPB)). (Regulations for NPB Developmental players, Article 2) \nA developmental players include players drafted as rookies (e.g. Yusuke Kosai and Michitaka Nishiyama, drafted developmental player who were first signed as a registered player under control in .), foreign players signed as developmental players (e.g., Raidel Martínez, Liván Moinelo.), players drafted as registered players under control but re-signed with a team as developmental players due to their abilities (e.g., Kenta Kurose - Re-signed as a registered player under control.), players who became free agents with their former team and signed with another team (e.g., Masaru Nakamura, Kouya Fujii - Re-signed as a registered player under control.), and players who were removed from the registration of players under control and re-signed as a developmental player due to treat injuries (e.g., Takuya Kuwahara, Hiroya Shimamoto.). There is an argument that eliminating players who cannot play due to injury from the registration of players under control and re-signing them as developmental players will protect their careers. On the other hand, the use of the developmental players system instead of the Major League Baseball (MLB) Injured list system is criticized as contrary to the original principle of this system, which is to open the door to amateur players and develop them. The oldest player to become a developmental player is Soichi Fujita, who signed in at the age of 39. The longest period as a developmental player was 's eight seasons (2011-) as of the season.\nOutcome.\nThe developmental player system, which began in the 2005 season, has been successful in producing major players for each team. (e.g. Yoshiki Sunada, Yuji Nishino) The Yomiuri Giants, who have been working on this system since early on, have signed more than 50 developmental players as their registered players under control as of the 2022 season. The Fukuoka Softbank Hawks have also signed 40 developmental players as their registered players under control, and have produced players like Kodai Senga and Takuya Kai who have won league titles and awards and represented Japanese baseball on the national baseball team. The Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters, which had been reluctant to acquire developmental players, drafted a player as a developmental player for the first time in the 2018 draft. In the 2022 draft, 51 players will be selected as developmental players, the largest number in history, and the acquisition of developmental players is a growing trend."

On February 26, 2022, Johnson scored a career high 16 points in an 84–74 victory over rival NC State.\nIn the 2022 NCAA Tournament, Johnson emerged as a valuable contributor, helping lead the 8 seeded Tar Heels to the Final Four. In the championship game against Kansas, Johnson scored 11 points off the bench before being forced to exit late in the game after collapsing and vomiting; North Carolina lost 69–72.\nIn his junior season, Johnson was one of the main rotation players used off the bench for the Tar Heels. Once again hampered by injuries that caused him to miss some time, he appeared in 27 of the team's 33 games. Of his 27 appearances in the 2022–23 season, Johnson made two starts. Usual starter Pete Nance missed two games due to a back injury, so Johnson filled Nance's spot in the lineup while Nance was out. He averaged 4.1 points and 2.7 rebounds per game on the year.\nFollowing the season, Johnson entered his name into the NCAA's transfer portal database, in search of more playing time elsewhere.\nPenn State.\nJohnson committed to play his senior season at Penn State.\nPersonal life.\nJohnson's older brother Cameron played for the Tar Heels from 2017 to 2019, and currently plays for the NBA's Brooklyn Nets. Johnson's mother is Croatian American. His nickname \"Puff\" originated from his enjoyment of Cocoa Puffs when he was young."

        "text": "The 2022 Breeders' Cup Classic was the 39th running of the Breeders' Cup Classic, part of the 2022 Breeders' Cup World Thoroughbred Championships program, and the fourth race in the so-called Grand Slam of Thoroughbred racing in North America. It was run on November 5, 2022 at Keeneland Racetrack in Lexington, Kentucky. It featured the top-ranked older horses in the United States, Flightline, Life Is Good and Olympiad, and the leading three-year-olds, Epicenter and Taiba. Flightline, the odds-on favorite, won the race by lengths, and is all but certain to be named the American Horse of the Year.\nThe Classic is run on dirt at one mile and one-quarter (approximately 2000 m). The purse of $6,000,000 was the highest in North America in 2022. The race is run under weight-for-age conditions, with entrants carrying the following weights:\nThe race was broadcast on NBC.\nContenders.\nThe Breeders' Cup Classic is open to up to 14 starters, with automatic berths for horses that win one of the designated \"Win and You're In\" races in the 2022 Breeders' Cup Challenge series. Other horses are ranked by their performances in graded stakes races and by the judgement of a panel of racing experts.\nEntries were taken on October 31 after which the post position draw was held. All eight entrants had won a Grade I race at some point in their career, and six were coming off wins in their previous start. The leading contenders include:\nRace description.\nThe two favorites, Flightline and Life Is Good, both had front-running styles and the concern before the race was that they would tire each other out in an early speed duel, opening the door to late closers. As expected, Life Is Good went to the early lead with Flightline a half-length behind after an opening quarter mile in a brisk 22.55 seconds. Around the first turn, Life Is Good widened the lead to two lengths, completing the half mile in very fast :45.47. He maintained the lead down the backstretch as the two front-runners opened a thirteen length lead after three-quarters of a mile in 1:09.62. Going into the final turn, Flightline began to make up ground, then took the lead after a mile in 1:34.58. (For contrast, the Dirt Mile run earlier that day was run in 1:35.33). At the top of the stretch, Flightline quickly drew away from Life Is Good, then continued to open the lead to win by lengths over Olympiad and Taiba. Life Is Good tired and eventually finished fifth.\nFlightline was the shortest-price winner in the history of the race and his winning margin of lengths was the longest. \"That's a pretty special horse,\" said Bill Mott, who trained the runner-up Olympiad. \"He chased down a fast horse and then kept going and drew off. You just don’t see that.\"\n\"The plan was to make Flightline earn it,\" said Elliott Walden of WinStar Farm, which co-owns Life Is Good. \"They are both great horses but the fractions took a toll on him... We have no regrets. We tried the mile and a quarter and we competed. That's what we were here to do.\"\nEpicenter was pulled up on the backstretch after suffering a fracture in the condyloid joint of his right foreleg. He underwent surgery at Rood &amp; Riddle Equine Hospital and was expected to recover to recover fully for stud duties.\nResults.\nTimes: – 22.55; – 45.47; – 1:09.27; mile – 1:34.58; final – 2:00.05&lt;br&gt;\nSplits for each quarter-mile: (22.55) (22.92) (23.80) (25.31) (25.47)\nPayout.\nPayout Schedule:"

Players who are eligible for concussion exemptions or who have been designated as replacements are allowed to return within 10 days.\nWhen a retired player participates in an official match as a retirement match, the player can be added to the team's player registration only on the day of the retirement match (limited to one day).\nCurrently (2022 season), up to 31 players can be registered.

        "title": "Midland Challenge Cup",
        "text": "The Midland Challenge Cup was an annual professional golf tournament played in the English Midlands. The event was organised by the Midlands Region of the Professional Golfers' Association and ran from 1903 to 1961. For most of its existence it acted as the Midland section qualifying event for the News of the World Match Play. Sectional qualification was discontinued after 1961 and the event was not held again.\nHistory.\nThe Midland Professional Golf Club held its first meeting in late 1897. Initially four tournaments were held each year, one being a championship. The first championship was held in May 1898. However, in 1900 the schedule was reduced to two, a championship meeting in April and an open meeting in October, open to professionals from outside the Midland region. the first open event, at Sandwell Park, was won by Robert Munro. There was another open meeting at Olton in 1901, won by James Sherlock. In 1902 the Midland Professional Golf Club amalgamated with the Professional Golfers' Association, which had been formed in 1901, becoming the Midland section of the PGA. The 1902 open tournament saw Harry Vardon, JH Taylor, and James Braid competing and was won by JH Taylor.\nIn 1902 the Midland Counties Competition, an organisation that ran some important amateur competitions in the Midlands and a predecessor of the current Midland Golf Union, passed a resolution recommending that clubs in the region subscribe a maximum of two guineas towards prize money in the two Midland professional tournaments. Some of the money raised was used to purchase a new trophy, the \"Midland Challenge Cup\", which was first awarded at the 1903 open meeting at Hollinwell. The first News of the World Match Play tournament was also held in 1903. Each section was allocated a number of places in the final stage, the Midland section having 5 of the 32 places. The open event acted as the qualifying event, the leading five midland players progressing to the final stage. The tournament was a 36-hole stroke-play event, contested in a single day. Tom Williamson won, four strokes ahead of James Sherlock.\nThe same system was used for a number of years. The Midland Professional Championship was held in April with the open event played in September, at which the Midland Challenge Cup was awarded and places for the midland golfers in the final stage of the News of the World Match Play. Sandy Herd won the Midland Challenge Cup in 1904, six strokes ahead of George Cawsey, the leading midland player. Tom Williamson won for the second time in 1905 with George Cawsey winning in 1906. Philip Wynne won in 1907 with George Coburn the leading midland golfer. In 1907 the number of News of the World qualifiers was reduced to four. Coburn won in 1908. 1909 produced the first tie in the event, between Charles Mayo and Wilfrid Reid. The pair played another nine holes in the evening, Mayo winning by two strokes. Frank Coltart tied for third place and was the leading midland player. 1910 produced another tie, between two midland players George Tuck and William Jeffries. As in 1909 a 9-hole playoff was arranged, Tuck winning by several strokes.\n1911 saw the introduction of a second event for which was sectional qualification was required. the Sphere and Tatler Foursomes Tournament. Qualification was based on individual stroke-play, qualifiers being drawn randomly into pairs for the finals stage. The Midland section was allocated 9 of the 64 places. The Midland section took the opportunity to switch the events; the Midland Challenge Cup being played as an open event in April, serving as the qualifying for the Sphere and Tatler Foursomes in May, while the championship was held in the autumn and acted as qualification for the News of the World Match Play, for which five places were now available. The reversal of the events caused some confusion in the press. Wilfrid Reid won the event three years in a row from 1911 to 1913. In 1911 he finished two strokes ahead of Jack Oke while in 1912 he was a stroke ahead of Tom Williamson. In 1913 he was tied with Laurie Ayton Snr but won the 18-hole playoff the following day by five strokes. Tom Williamson won in 1914. He was tied with Jack B. Ross but won the playoff the next day by six strokes,\nIn May 1919 the Midland section held a \"Victory Tournament\". Tom Williamson tied with Archie Compston after the 36 holes and they were still tied after a further nine holes. Williamson won after a further nine holes were player.\nAlthough the Sphere and Tatler Foursomes was not revived after the war, another event, the 72-hole Daily Mail Tournament, replaced it in the calendar and also involved sectional qualifying. The Midland Challenge Cup continued to be played in April acting as the qualification event for the Daily Mail tournament. At Hollinwell in 1920 the cup was won by Hugh Roberts, a stroke ahead of Tom Williamson. Len Holland won in 1921, beating Arthur Ham and Alfred Matthews in an 18-hole playoff. From 1922 to 1924 there were big wins, James Adwick winnin9g by five strokes in 1922, Michael Bingham by four in 1923 and Holland by five in 1924. Williamson won three times in a row from 1925 to 1927, each time by one stroke.\nThe Daily Mail Tournament was not played from 1928 to 1935 and the opportunity was taken to separate the News of the World Match Play qualifying from the championship. The Midland Challenge Cup was awarded to the winner of the News of the World qualifying event, as was the case before 1911. The number of qualification places for the News of the World event varied from year to year but in this period was either 9 or 10. In 1928 this was held in June with the championship in September but from 1929 the order was reversed, with the championship played in the early part of the year and the News of the World qualifying in September. Tom Barber won the cup in 1928, after a playoff against Charles Pixton, and retained it the following year. There were two multiple winners in the 1930, Bill Martin winning in 1934 and 1935, while Jack McMillan won in 1936 and 1939.\nIn early 1940 the cup was awarded to the leading qualifier in the Midland section of the Daily Mail Tournament, and was won by Tom Haliburton. For a number of year the winner of the cup was not widely reported but it seems that was also given to leading Midland qualifier in the Daily Mail event in 1949 and 1950, the last two year of that tournament. From 1951 it was awarded again awarded to the winner of the News of the World Match Play qualification event. From 1956 the Midland Professional Championship and the Midland Challenge Cup were played on successive days at the same venue. Ralph Moffitt won the Midland Challenge Cup three times, in 1954, 1956 and 1960. In 1956 the winner of the event was Alex Tibbles, then working in Peru. He was not eligible to win the Midland Challenge Cup, which was won by Moffitt, the runner-up in the event. Frank Jowle was another multiple winner, winning in 1955 and 1959. George Maisey was final winner of the event, winning in 1961. From 1962 sectional qualification for the News of the World championship was replaced by local qualifying on the two days prior to the knock-out stage.\nIn 1980 the cup was reused as the trophy for the Midland Matchplay Championship which had started in 1972 and ran until 1999.\nWinners.\nFrom 1903 to 1910, from 1928 to 1939 and from 1951 to 1961 it was the Midland section qualifying event for the News of the World Matchplay. From 1911 to 1914 it was the qualifying event for the Sphere and Tatler Foursomes Tournament. From 1920 to 1927 and in 1946, 1949 and 1950 it was the qualifying event for the Daily Mail Tournament."

        "text": "The 47th FIS Alpine World Ski Championships took place from 6 to 19 February 2023 in two neighboring locations in the French Alps, Courchevel and Méribel.\nThe location was decided in May 2018 during the 51st FIS Congress in Costa Navarino (Greece), where Courchevel-Méribel won against Austrian Saalbach-Hinterglemm with 9 to 6 votes.\nThe same two towns already hosted parts of the 1992 Winter Olympic Games. In Courchevel, ski jumping and the Nordic combination took place, and Méribel was the location for the women's alpine skiing.\nBidding.\nIn 2015, upon a request by the Fédération Française de Ski (FFS), Courchevel, Méribel and Val d'Isère drew up proposals to organize a ski world championship in France. In January 2016, the FFS then chose the joint bid of Courchevel and Méribel. On 24 January 2017, the bid of the two alpine resorts was submitted to the FIS. Finally, in May 2018, the FIS selected the French bid, after competing against the Austrian bid. The then-time president of the Austrian Ski Association, Peter Schröcksnadel, commented that the decision was understandable, as the French had been waiting for a World Championships in their own country for four years longer than the Austrians, and that Austria had already hosted several large sport events during the last few years.\nIn March 2022, Courchevel and Méribel hosted the finals of the 2021–22 FIS Alpine Ski World Cup.\nQualification.\nPer discipline and gender, each national ski federation could nominate four skiers. The current world champion in the respective discipline was allowed as a fifth competitor. In addition, every participant must had less than 80 FIS points. Skiers who perform better in recent official competitions have less points; the top 30 skiers on the current World Cup starting list have, by definition, between 0 and 5.99 FIS Points. In some events, competitors passed a further qualification at the Championships themselves (see below).\nSchedule.\nThe competitive program was as follows (all times CET):"

        "title": "Royal Spanish Gymnastics Federation",
        "text": "The Royal Spanish Gymnastics Federation (, RFEG) is the highest national gymnastics body in Spain. Its headquarters are in Madrid and its current president is Jesús Carballo. Founded by Narciso Masferrer in 1899 as the Spanish Gymnastic Federation, it is the second oldest Federation in Spain, behind the cycling one. The federation was one of the most important entities in the amateur beginnings of Football in Spain because it acted as the Spanish Football Federation until 1904.\nIt is made up of 19 regional federations and is represented in Spain by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG) and the European Gymnastics (UEG). The disciplines of gymnastics that fall within the RFEG are artistic gymnastics, rhythmic gymnastics, trampoline Gymnastics, and acrobatic gymnastics. The most important competitions that it organizes are the Spanish Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships, and the . In 2018 he co-organized the 2018 Rhythmic Gymnastics European Championships in Guadalajara.\nIn Spain, gymnastics (in all its modalities) is the most practiced sport, being developed by 34.6% of sports practitioners according to the Survey of Sports Habits 2010 of the CSD. The most practiced competitive gymnastics discipline in Spain is rhythmic gymnastics, being the 4th most practiced sports discipline among girls and adolescents, only surpassed by swimming, basketball and football, according to the Sports Habits Survey of the School Population (2011), prepared by the CSD.\nHistory.\nThe federation's history began on 1 March 1898, when Narciso Masferrer published an appeal to all Spanish athletes to create a \"Confederation of Spanish Gymnastic Societies\" in the Barcelona newspaper , which had also been created by him in 1897. A positive response resulted in a meeting in Madrid on 7 June 1898 and \"Federación Espyearla de Gimnasia\" (Spanish Gymnastic Federation) was born and the first Executive Committee was appointed. The first president of the Federation was José Canalejas. The founders included the Gymnastic of Tarragona, the Gymnasium of Vigo, the Gymnastic Club of Cartagena, the Catalan Society of Gymnastics and the Gymnastic Society of Orense. Shortly after the Spanish Gymnastic Society joined, which had shown initial reluctance to the initiative.\nOn 26 September 1899, the Spanish Gymnastic Federation was officially founded within the framework of its first General Assembly, held in Madrid. The Spanish Federation of Gymnastics is therefore the second oldest Spanish sports federation after the cycling one. The Spanish Gymnastic Federation would hold three more General Assemblies: in 1900 in Barcelona, in 1901 in Zaragoza and in 1902 again in Barcelona. In addition, he organized the so-called Federal Holidays, which included competitions in various sports. On 20 March 1902, the Federation was declared a \"True Public Utility Society\" by the Government of Spain. The sports competitions organized by the Federation in Barcelona during La Mercè in September 1902, which included a football tournament, is considered by some authors to be the first great exhibition of Spanish sports. From that year on, however, the Federation began its decline, and around 1904 this society seems to disappear. In 1906, Narciso Masferrer, among other people, lamented the disappearance of the Spanish Gymnastic Federation in the pages of \"El Mundo Deportivo\".\nIn June 1932, at the initiative of the Spanish Gymnastic Society, the current Spanish Federation of Gymnastics was established, although it continued to retain the name of Spanish Gymnastic Federation or Spanish Gymnastic Confederation for some years. In 1933 he joined the International Gymnastics Federation. In 1941 it organized the first Spanish Artistic Gymnastics Championship for men, while in 1953 the first for women was held. As of 1966, the Spanish Federation of Gymnastics was split from the weight.\nIn 1974, the Spanish Gymnastics Federation created the national rhythmic gymnastics team of Spain and in 1975 both the first Spanish Individual and Group Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships were organized, as well as the 1975 World Rhythmic Gymnastics Championships in Madrid, the first Rhythmic Gymnastics World Championships held in Spain. In 1999, the Royal Spanish Gymnastics Federation celebrated its first centenary through various events.\nPresidents.\nFirst Phase\nSecond Phase\nAwards, recognitions and distinctions.\nList of awards that the Spanish Federation of Gymnastics has received since its foundation.\nFederaciones autonómicas.\nLa RFEG está integrada por 19 federaciones de ámbito autonómico:"

Prior to the start, stage 3 winner Wiebes withdrew due to illness. Kastelijn took the points over the first two climbs, taking the lead in the mountains classification. Ricarda Bauernfeind (Canyon–SRAM), an experienced time trialist, attacked from the peloton, eventually building up a lead of around 1' 30\". The peloton gave chase, however the gap did not fall fast enough to catch her. In the closing kilometres, Lippert and Marlen Reusser (SD Worx) attempted to catch her. Bauernfeind was too strong, and crossed the finish line 22 seconds ahead of the pair. During the stage, Vollering suffered a puncture, before drafting her team car to get back to the main bunch, drawing the ire of commissaires. She was subsequently penalised 20 seconds in the general classification, dropping her to seventh place in the , 12 seconds behind her rival Van Vleuten. The following day, SD Worx directeur sportif Danny Stam was removed from the race due to \"inappropriate comments\" made to the commissaires, as well as his \"dangerous overtaking ... of cars and riders\" while Vollering was drafting his car.\nStage 6 to Blagnac was the final chance for sprinters to win, given the parcours of the remaining stages. A breakaway including Emma Norsgaard (Movistar Team) was formed with around to go, establishing a two minute lead. During the stage, contender Veronica Ewers (EF Education–Tibco–SVB) crashed heavily. She finished the stage, albeit in pain – it later transpired that Ewers had a broken collarbone and would not start stage 7. In the closing kilometres of the stage, the gap to the breakaway steadily fell as the sprinters teams gave chase. In the final , a tight chicane over the Toulouse tramway caused a small crash, distracting the peloton and delaying some riders as they gave chase. With 600 metres to the finish, Norsgaard launched an attack, as the gap collapsed behind her. Norsgaard held on to win the stage by a second. Charlotte Kool (Team DSM–Firmenich) finished second, with third placed Kopecky in the yellow jersey visibly annoyed not to have caught Norsgaard before the finish line. Riders subsequently criticised the chicane in the last kilometres, with Ashleigh Moolman Pasio (AG Insurance–Soudal–Quick-Step) calling it \"super, super dangerous\".\nMountain stage to Col du Tourmalet.\nThe seventh stage of the race took the riders over two major climbs in the Pyrenees mountains, and was considered as the queen stage of the race. Starting with the first category Col d'Aspin (12 km with an average gradient of 6.5%), riders then ascended the hors catégorie Col du Tourmalet (17.1 km with an average gradient of 7.5%), finishing at the summit at an elevation of . The climbs were last tackled by the peloton at the 2007 Grande Boucle, with a summit finish last occurring in the 2000 edition of the race.\nPrior to the start of the stage, Elisa Longo Borghini (Lidl–Trek) who was fourth on , withdrew from the race due to a skin infection. After initial skirmishes, the peloton hit the Col d'Aspin with contenders immediately powering away from the rest of the field. Van Vleuten launched an attack from the top, followed by her rival Vollering as well as Katarzyna Niewiadoma (Canyon–SRAM). Niewiadoma took the at the top of the climb. On the descent, Niewiadoma was substantially faster than both Vollering and Van Vleuten. The two rivals did not wish to work together to chase her, deciding to wait for teammates behind. This allowed Niewiadoma's lead to balloon to nearly 45 seconds.\nOn the ascent of the Col du Tourmalet, the yellow jersey group including Juliette Labous (DSM–Firmenich), Moolman Pasio, Reusser, Kopecky, Vollering and Van Vleuten worked to reduce the gap to Niewiadoma to just six seconds. But Niewiadoma kept working, eventually extending her lead to 30 seconds with to go. In thick fog, Vollering attacked with to the summit, with Van Vleuten unable to follow. Passing Niewiadoma a few kilometres later, Vollering soloed to the top of the climb, winning the stage by 1' 58\" ahead of Niewiadoma. Van Vleuten finished the stage 2' 34\" behind Vollering in third, with the yellow jersey of Kopecky finishing sixth on the stage, 3' 32\" behind Vollering.\nVollering therefore took the yellow jersey of the general classification, with a lead of 1' 50\" ahead of Niewiadoma. Van Vleuten took third on , 2' 28\" behind Vollering. Kopecky fell to fourth overall, just seven seconds behind Van Vleuten and four seconds ahead of Moolman Pasio in fifth place. Niewiadoma took the polka dot jersey of the mountains classification, with a four point lead over Kastelijn. Kopecky retained her green jersey of the points classification. Kerbaol retained the young rider classification, despite losing 44 seconds to her rival Ella Wyllie (Lifeplus–Wahoo).\nTime trial in Pau.\nThe final stage of the race was an individual time trial over a twisting course in Pau. The course was similar to one previously used for a time trial at the 2019 Tour de France, as well as for the 2019 La Course by Le Tour de France stage race. It was considered unlikely that Vollering would lose the yellow jersey on the stage, in light of her lead over Niewiadoma. However third placed Kopecky was just seven seconds behind Van Vleuten and four seconds ahead of Moolman-Pasio.\nThe fastest time on the stage was set by Reusser, two time silver medalist at the time trial world championships and silver medalist in the time trial at Tokyo 2020. Kopecky then set a fast time, 38 seconds slower than Reusser. Next on the stage was Van Vleuten, who finished 1' 41\" slower than Reusser. Finishing fourteenth on the stage, she fell off the overall podium into fourth place. Niewiadoma had a 38\" lead over Van Vleuten, and a 45\" lead over Kopecky. Her time trial was 1' 23\" slower than Reusser, finishing ninth on the stage. Kopecky therefore took second place overall by 21 hundredths of a second. Niewiadoma was third overall.\nThe last rider to start was Vollering, who finished second on the stage, 10\" behind Reusser – sealing her victory in the Tour de France Femmes.\nSummary.\nIn the final general classification (GC), Demi Vollering (SD Worx) won the Tour de France Femmes with an advantage over her teammate Lotte Kopecky of over three minutes. Finishing in third place for the second year in a row was Katarzyna Niewiadoma (), who finished 21 hundredths of a second behind Kopecky. Vollering retained her lead in the UCI Women's World Tour standings.\nIn the race's other classifications, Kopecky won the points classification. Apart from finishing third in the , Niewiadoma also took the polka-dot jersey as winner of the Queen of the Mountains (QoM) classification. Cédrine Kerbaol of took the white jersey as the winner of the young riders classification, which was awarded to the best-placed rider under the age of 23. SD Worx won the team classification as the team with the lowest aggregate time among their three best-placed riders. Yara Kastelijn took the super-combativity award to add to her win on stage 4. Out of 154 starters, 123 finished the event.\nVollering expressed her delight following her victory, stating that she \"still can't believe it\". She also expressed her hope that the Tour has \"inspired many young girls and women\". Her rival Van Vleuten was disappointed with her performance, and praised Vollering for her victory. She also explained that illness had dampened her performance in both the mountainous stage 7 and the final time trial. Niewiadoma was pleased with her polka dot jersey, while expressing disappointment about losing second place overall. Kopecky's strong performance was praised, with \"L'Équipe\" calling her \"the Wout van Aert of women's cycling\". Overall, SD Worx dominated the event, with 1st and 2nd place in the overall classification, 1st in the points and team classifications, as well as 4 stage wins.\nMedia coverage following the event praised the television viewership, large crowds and the course design (including mountain stages), while others expressed concern regarding awareness of key contenders by the general public, and the disparity in prize money. \"L'Équipe\" called the Tourmalet stage \"a key moment in the evolution of women's cycling\". Cyclingnews.com noted that the French public made \"no distinction ... between the men's and women's race\", referring to both races as the Tour de France. \"Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace\" stated that the race was \"met with real popular success\", and race director Marion Rousse stated that the 2023 edition \"was the year of confirmation: we had to prove that the first edition was not just curiosity\".\nCyclingnews.com noted that the \"logical next step\" for the race would be to visit the Alps, noting that the race organisers ASO seemed \"keen to include at least one very famous climb\" in each edition of the race following La Planche des Belles Filles in 2022 and the Col du Tourmalet in 2023.\nBroadcasting.\nAs with the 2022 edition, live television coverage was provided by France Télévisions in conjunction with the European Broadcasting Union. French television coverage moved to the higher profile France 2 channel owing to the high viewership of the 2022 edition. At least two and a half hours of each stage were broadcast, with the first and last stages shown from start to finish.\nFollowing the event, broadcasters reported high viewing figures. In France, France 2 reported an average of 2 million viewers over the eight stages (a 25% audience share), and a peak of 4.3 million viewers watching stage 7 on the Col du Tourmalet (a 34.6% audience share). In Belgium, Sporza reported an average of around 393,000 viewers (a 55% audience share), with a peak of over 695,000 viewers on stage 7. In the Netherlands, NOS reported an average of 627,000 viewers over the eight stages, with a peak of 2.5 million on stage 7 (a 42% audience share)."

Skeleton is developing a novel raw material, curved graphene, to produce solutions for the energy storage market, including high-power supercapacitors and high-energy solid-state batteries.\nAbout.\nSkeleton was established in 2009 by Oliver Ahlberg, Taavi Madiberk, Dr. Jaan Leis, and Dr. Anti Perkson when they began developing graphene-based supercapacitors. The company now has over 300 employees throughout its various locations. Skeleton operates in Germany and Estonia, with headquarters, IT and module development in Tallinn. In Germany, the company operates a materials development facility for curved graphene in Bitterfeld-Wolfen, as well as a supercapacitor factory in Großröhrsdorf. Skeleton is also building an additional supercapacitor factory near Leipzig in partnership with Siemens, which is estimated to become the world's largest supercapacitor production site.\nCurrently, Skeleton is a supplier to a number of global OEMs in automotive, transportation, grid, and further industrial applications such as Siemens, Škoda, and Hitachi. They are also a member of the European Battery Alliance, an industry group with over 750 members focused on developing a European battery value chain. The company has received media attention in outlets such as Bloomberg News, The Economist, Sifted, and Financial Times for their German production, battery expertise, and development of novel technologies.\nSkeleton is a Global Cleantech 100 company.\nHistory.\n2009–2012: First production.\nSkeleton Technologies was created in 2009 for the purpose of developing graphene-based supercapacitors. In 2011, the company started the development of SpaceCap, a capacitor based on Skeleton's proprietary Carbon Derived Carbon material, as a part of a commission from the European Space Agency. In 2012, Skeleton launched its first commercial product series.\n2013–2016: First investor, manufacturing, and awards.\nIn 2013, Skeleton Technologies was incorporated in Germany for the first time as a GmbH, the German equivalent of a private limited company or limited liability company. That same year, the company received its first financing tranche of 2.2 million euros in Round A financing.\nIn 2014, the company opened and began operating out of its first manufacturing facility in Viimsi, Estonia. They also participated in the Norway Grants \"Green ICT\" program, a cooperation programme between Estonia and Norway intended to facilitate sustainable development and green technology innovation, using the grant money to continue the development of their ultracapacitor technologies.\nAt the Ecosummit 2015 in London, Skeleton Technologies was presented with the 'best startup' award as well as 1.5K EUR in prize money. Together with Adgero SARL, in 2015 they introduced a supercapacitor-based kinetic energy recovery system for trucks, designed to reduce fuel consumption.\n2017–2019: Production scaling, portfolio expansion, and growth.\nIn 2017, Skeleton ISO 9001 and 14001 began to scale up production of its ISO 9001 and 14001 modules at its facility in Großröhrsdorf, Germany. At the tenth annual Bloomberg New Energy Finance Summit in New York City, the company was honoured as one of ten 2017 New Energy Pioneers.\nBeginning in 2018, the company expanded its product portfolio and began receiving orders from firms in the automotive, logistics, and aerospace industries.\nBy 2019, Skeleton's revenue growth tripled, and the company received more than 100 million euros in order intake. After a stringent testing course, the company's SkelCap SCA series supercapacitor cells were given 810A certification from the safety organisation UL, certifying that the cells are safe for use in automotive applications and uninterruptible power supplies.\n2020–2022: Continued investment and new factory.\nFollowing a Series D financing round in 2020, Skeleton raised an additional 41.3 million euros.\nIn 2021, Skeleton Technologies was awarded the SET4FUTURE Innovation Award, honouring organisations that create innovative products and solutions for future railway technology and contribute to traffic reduction. The company also received IATF 16949 certification, an international quality standard for the automotive industry, that year.\nIn 2022, Skeleton announced the investment of 220 million euros to begin building a new factory near Leipzig, in partnership with Siemens. The factory will be located in Markranstädt and is Skeleton's second manufacturing site in the state of Saxony.\nIndustries and applications.\nAutomotive.\nSkeleton produces supercapacitors to improve fuel efficiency and support power storage and discharge in electric vehicles. In automotive applications, supercapacitors can be connected in parallel with batteries to increase both energy density and power density and improve the longevity of the energy storage system.\nGrid.\nSkeleton offers supercapacitor-based energy storage systems for wind power applications, which help control wind power plant output and provide ancillary services to the power system. As an energy storage medium, supercapacitors can deploy electricity instantaneously to manage demand surges and power quality issues such as flickers and interruption events. In heavy transport and grid applications, Skeleton works with the Italian electronics wholesaler DimacRed S.p.A. for distribution and technical cooperation.\nIndustrial.\nSkeleton has developed solutions for cranes and elevators as well as technologies for the marine, medical, and oil &amp; gas sectors. For Transiidikeskus, one of the largest container terminals in the Baltic Region, the company developed a crane equipped with a graphene supercapacitor-powered kinetic energy recovery system (KERS), reducing the fuel consumption and emissions by 34%. Skeleton has also developed a KERS system for elevators that is able to reduce energy consumption by 50% or more by storing and reusing energy generated during operation.\nTransportation.\nIn addition to cars, Skeleton Technologies provides supercapacitor-based solutions for rail and trams, trucks, bus, and heavy equipment.\nSkeleton Technologies and Class8 Energy, a Canadian equipment distributor, have signed an €11.6 million contract to supply supercapacitor modules to the North American trucking and retail industries. The modules will reduce cold-cranking time by a factor of 2 and offer higher cranking power than a battery, without toxic materials.\nThe company is a supplier for several tram producers in major European cities. Skeleton has a contract with Škoda Electric, a branch of the auto company which produces electric motors for rail applications, to provide supercapacitors for Mannheim's tram system. They also have a large-scale contract with Medcom, an electric traction producer, to provide supercapacitors for the Warsaw tram network. For Škoda and Medcom, the SkelMod 51V module has enabled energy savings of up to 30% with onboard kinetic energy recovery, an application where braking energy is harnessed by the supercapacitor module bank and used for acceleration.\nPolish electrical switchgear manufacturer ZPUE and Skeleton Technologies have signed a letter of intent, stating that Skeleton will provide supercapacitors for rail wayside storage at 200 MW per year from 2023 to 2025. These storage systems, located inside the station rather than in the train itself, capture energy released as the train brakes and use it to power acceleration. Skeleton will also supply 160 MW of storage for grid stability applications between 2023 and 2025. The cooperation represents more than 30 million euros of commercial value. As with tram applications, Skeleton's technologies have been shown to improve train efficiency by increasing energy savings to reduce costs and emissions. The implementation of supercapacitor technology provides effective voltage stabilization for rail systems, improves propulsion performance for light rail vehicles, and advances locomotive engine starting technologies.\nTechnology.\nSkeleton's SkelCap supercapacitor series provides up to four times higher power density as well as lower equivalent series resistance when compared to other supercapacitor cells, leading to improved application lifetime. They have a long lifetime of over 1 million charge cycles or 15+ years and near-total efficiency in temperatures ranging from −40 to 65 degrees Celsius.\nFinancing.\nSkeleton Technologies has secured funding from a variety of sources including:\nIn total, Skeleton Technologies have received over 300 million euros in financing. Additional investors include Harju Elekter, Up Invest, MM Grupp, CTEK, and Wise.\nPhilanthropy.\nSkeleton Technologies CEO and co-founder Taavi Madiberk initiated discussions to establish a €20 million support fund from the European Innovation Council for Ukrainian deep tech startups after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. At a press conference in Brussels, Commissioner for Innovation and Research Mariya Gabriel announced her support for the fund, which targets innovative tech companies that are established in Ukraine as well as companies that have relocated to EU member states or Horizon Europe-associated countries following the start of the war. The proposal focuses on strengthening the Ukrainian tech ecosystem and supporting innovative solutions for rebuilding."

        "text": "The 2021 Physical Disability Rugby League World Cup, also known as the 2021 PDRL World Cup, was the first world cup for physical disability rugby league. The tournament was held from 23 October to 30 October 2022 in Warrington, England, alongside the main tournaments of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup. The tournament was originally planned as part of the 2021 Festival of World Cups, which was due to take place in the summer of 2021, but was rescheduled following the postponement of the festival. England defeated New Zealand 42–10 in the final to become the first world champions.

The four teams competed in a round-robin group stage with the top two going on to the final and the other teams playing to determine the third and fourth places.\nWales Technical Infringement.\nDuring halftime of the 28 October Wales v Australia game, it was announced that during the Wales v New Zealand game (23 October), Wales had committed an unintended technical breach. This breach was in regard to the ability classification level of the players onfield; in PDRL, ability is divided into three categories, and denoted by specific sock colours. There can be only a specific number of players per sock colour on the field at a time. The Welsh coach attributed the infraction of this rule to \"miscommunications across the board\", and as a result, Wales competed in the third place playoffs rather than the final competition.\nGroup stage.\n&lt;section begin=NZLvWAL /&gt;\n&lt;section end=NZLvWAL /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=ENGvAUS /&gt;\n&lt;section end=ENGvAUS /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=WALvENG /&gt;\n&lt;section end=WALvENG /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=AUSvNZL /&gt;\n&lt;section end=AUSvNZL /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=ENGvNZL /&gt;\n&lt;section end=ENGvNZL /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=AUSvWAL /&gt;\n&lt;section end=AUSvWAL /&gt;\nKnockout stage.\n&lt;section begin=Third-place /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Third-place /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Final /&gt;"

The first discipline of the section was hazena, and soon the players also started playing basketball and volleyball (usually practicing several sports at the same time).\nIn the 1930s, Polonia's women basketball players were among the country's top players - they won two Polish championship titles (1934, 1935), twice won the Winter Cup of the Polish Sports Games Association (1934, 1935 - a tournament equivalent to today's Polish Cup), twice won the national vice-championship (1933, 1937) and once took third place (1939).\nAfter World War II, the women's basketball section was revived in mid-1948, and the very next year the basketball players won the Polish vice-championship. In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Polonia finished on the podium of the Polish championship six times. Its greatest successes - including the Polish vice-championship in 1976 - came under coach Bohdan Bartosiewicz, who held that position continuously from 1962 to 1976. In 1976 the Polonia women's basketball represented Poland as Vice-Champions in the Ronchetti Cup.\nIn 1978, the club was relegated from the highest level of the competition (then the First League) for the first time in its history. In the following years, it repeatedly made his way between the premier league and the second division. Before the 2000/2001 season, despite remaining in the first division, the team was withdrawn from the competition for financial reasons, and the section was disbanded.\nReactivation - as SKK Polonia Warsaw - took place in 2011. On April 17, 2021, the club won the First Women's Basketball League and earned the right to play in the Basket Liga Kobiet. In the first season after returning to the top league (2021/2022), Polonia advanced to the play-offs, eventually finishing a high 7th in the league. In the 2022/2023 season, the club will compete in an international competition for again in its history - the European Women's Basketball League."

Asia Rugby apologised and explained that it was down to \"simple human error\" made by a junior member of staff. The Chief Secretary for Administration, Eric Chan said the Hong Kong government raised \"strong objection to the association for its inability\" to prevent the mistake from happening. While Chief Executive John Lee said that the \"song that was played was closely connected to the 2019 violence and disturbances, and advocacy for Hong Kong's independence,\" and said that the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau would investigate the matter.

        "text": "The 2021 Rugby League World Cup final was the rugby league match to determine the winner of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup, played between Australia and Samoa on 19 November 2022 at Old Trafford in Manchester, England.\nBackground.\nThe 2021 Men's Rugby League World Cup, was the 16th edition of the World Cup, the IRL's rugby league competition for national teams. The tournament was held in England from 15 October 2022 to 19 November 2022, but was originally scheduled to be held between 23 October 2021 and 27 November 2021 and was postponed due the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent withdrawals of Australia and New Zealand. 16 teams are competing in the tournament, an increase of two from the previous two tournaments and the first to feature 16 teams since the 2000 Rugby League World Cup.\nVenue.\nOld Trafford will host the World Cup final for the third time, having previously hosted the final in 2000, when Australia beat New Zealand 40–12, and in 2013, when they beat the same opponents 34–2. It was confirmed as the venue to host the final on 10 June 2020, when the fixture for the event was released.\nThe ground is often used for major rugby league matches, being the primary venue for the annual Super League Grand Final, which is the championship-deciding game of Britain's Super League competition, and top-tier test matches such as the Kangaroo tour and the now-defunct Four Nations.\nThe ground is the home stadium of English football team Manchester United, and has a capacity of 74,310, which makes it the largest club football stadium (second-largest football stadium overall after Wembley Stadium, and third largest in all with the rugby union Twickenham Stadium coming in second) in the United Kingdom, and the eleventh-largest in Europe.\nRoute to the final.\nAustralia.\nAustralia won all three group stage matches against Fiji, Scotland and Italy all convincingly.\nFinishing on top of their group, they played Lebanon in the first quarter-final, where they won 48–4, advancing to a semi-final berth against Trans-Tasman rivals, New Zealand. In the semi-final, Australia were trailing 10–14 at half time to the Kiwis. A 52nd minute converted try to Cameron Murray, ended up being the match winner however, winning the match 16–14 which saw the Kangaroos qualify for their 12th consecutive World Cup final.\nSamoa.\nDespite losing the opening match of the tournament 60–6 against host nation England at St James' Park, Samoa finished the group stage in second place after large wins against Greece and France. This qualified them for a quarter-final berth against fellow Pacific island nation, Tonga.\nSamoa reached the semi-finals after a narrow 20–18 win over Tonga at Halliwell Jones Stadium in Warrington. Despite both teams scoring three tries each, it was Samoa that won the match, with Stephen Crichton converting all three tries and a penalty goal.\nThey faced England in the semi-final at the Emirates Stadium in London. Tim Lafai scored the first try of the game in the sixth minute to give Samoa a 4–0 lead, and for the first time in the tournament, England conceded first. Five minutes later, Junior Paulo was shown a yellow card, and also put on report, for a dangerous tackle on George Williams. Elliott Whitehead scored England's first try on 25 minutes, with Tommy Makinson successful with the conversion, to give England a 6–4 lead. Five minutes later, Samoa scored again, this time from Ligi Sao to retake the lead 8–4; Stephen Crichton was successful with the conversion to give Samoa a 10–4 lead at half-time.\nFive minutes into the second half, England scored again, this time through John Bateman, and Makinson was once again successful with the conversion to make it 10–10. Two tries in seven minutes saw Samoa take a 20–12 lead, with England now needing at least two tries to draw level. Herbie Farnworth broke clear on 65 minutes, to race away and touch down near the posts, giving Makinson an easy conversion. From the kick-off, England were awarded a penalty, after Sam Tomkins was tackled in the air. Samoa used the captain's challenge, and after a quick review, the video referee agreed with the decision to award the penalty, meaning the challenge was unsuccessful. Makinson opted to kick the penalty and was successful, levelling the scores at 20–20 with just over 12 minutes remaining. Stephen Crichton looked to have won it for Samoa with sven minutes to go, as he intercepted a Dom Young pass to touch down under the posts, converting his own try. There was more drama to come, as Farnworth got his second try of the game with two minutes remaining, Makinson once again converting to take the game to extra time.\nSamoa attempted to score the golden point with a drop goal early in extra time, but it was charged down by England. Samoa eventually won the match after a forward pass from Sam Tomkins gave them possession 35 metres out. Crichton kicked the winning drop goal to send Samoa to their first World Cup final, making them the first team other than England, Australia or New Zealand to reach the final in 50 years.\nPre-match.\nTicketing.\nAs of 16 November, it was confirmed by tournament chief executive Jon Dutton, that almost 64,000 tickets had been sold for the match. Dutton conceded that the match will unlikely to sell-out the 74,310 capacity Old Trafford due to tournament hosts England being eliminated in the second semi-final to Samoa. The 2013 final attracted 74,468 fans, but the 2021 edition \"will gross three times more\" in revenue due to increased ticketing and hospitality prices. The final ended up attracting 67,502 fans in attendance.\nOfficiating.\nAshley Klein officiated the match as head referee; it was Klein's second World Cup final, having also taken charge of the 2008 final in Brisbane. The touch judges were Jack Smith and Warren Turley from the Rugby Football League, Gerard Sutton was the reserve referee, and the video referee and captain's challenge duties were undertaken by Chris Kendall and Grant Atkins respectively.\nTeam selection.\nAustralian named an unchanged line-up from their semi-final victory over New Zealand.\nFa'amanu Brown suffered a concussion in the semi-final against England, which saw him miss the final for Samoa. Chanel Harris-Tavita replaced him at hooker in his final rugby league match, with Connelly Lemuelu taking his place on the interchange. Samoan captain Junior Paulo also escaped suspension for a dangerous tackle on Thomas Burgess in the semi-final.\nJames Tedesco and Junior Paulo captained their respective nations in the final.\nSupport.\nIn the lead-up to the match, American actor and former professional wrestler Dwayne Johnson posted on Instagram his support for the Samoan team, as it is their first appearance in a World Cup final. Johnson has Samoan heritage through his mother and grew up playing rugby in his youth. Tua Tagovailoa, the quarterback for the Miami Dolphins in the National Football League, also shared his support for the team.\nWomen's final.\nThe match was played as a double-header with the women's final between Australia and New Zealand for the second time in the tournament's history, and the first time in England. Australia won the match 54–4.\nEntertainment.\nHeather Small, the former lead vocalist of the Manchester-based dance music band M People, performed at half-time and full-time of the men's fixture, as well as bringing out the women's trophy before that match.\nEmilia Bertolini performed the national anthem of Australia, but it is unknown who sung the national anthem of Samoa before the match.\nFormer England captain Kevin Sinfield was welcomed into the stadium at half-time of the match as he completed his Ultra 7 in 7 Challenge marathon raising awareness for motor neuron disease. Sinfield has raised over £5 million for his efforts.\nMatch.\nSummary.\nFirst half.\nSamoa started the match well with early pressure but Australia's strong defensive performance laid the foundations and more than lived up to their billing as overwhelming favourites. Samoa were unlucky not to have been awarded a 40/20 kick, and despite a competitive start to the match, were hit by two tries in four minutes; Latrell Mitchell breaking the deadlock on 13 minutes before Josh Addo-Carr and Liam Martin extended Australia's lead to 14–0 at half-time.\nSecond half.\nAfter the break, Angus Crichton was sin-binned for an elbow that ruled out Chanel Harris-Tavita for the remainder of the match with a head injury, but even with a man down Australia added a fourth try through Cameron Murray. Brian To'o scored a consolation for Samoa to make it 20–6, before Tedesco and Stephen Crichton exchanged tries prior to Mitchell rounding up the scoring with his second try in the final minute. The match finished 30–10 with Australia winning their 12th title and third consecutive.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=Final /&gt;&lt;section begin=Final1 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Final1 /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Final /&gt;\nPost-match.\nJames Tedesco was named man of the match for Australia, scoring two tries in the final.\nBroadcasting.\nIn Australia, the match was broadcast live on Fox League, with kick-off starting at 03:00 AEDT (). It had an audience of 151,000, with 51,000 watching the pre-match coverage and 44,000 watching post-game."

It covers all of the bases required for classification as a bowling simulation, but fails to go above and beyond the call of duty in any regard\""

        "title": "2005–06 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey season",
        "text": "The 2005–06 Wisconsin Badgers men's ice hockey season was the 57th season of play for the program and 37th in the WCHA. They represented the University of Wisconsin–Madison in the 2005–06 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey season. They were coached by Mike Eaves, in his 4th season and played their home games at Kohl Center. The team won the 2006 NCAA Division I men's ice hockey tournament, the 6th title in program history.\nSeason.\nWisconsin entered the season with a great deal of talent on the roster but not much to show for their efforts. Despite having about a dozen players selected in the NHL Entry Draft, the Badgers had flamed out in postseason play over the previous two years. They also had to replace previous starter Bernd Brückler, though they had a capable understudy in Brian Elliott. Wisconsin received a top-10 ranking in the preseason, however, they were already being downgraded before they played a single game. They dipped even further when they split their opening weekend but after that the team began to pull together.\nThe team didn't play its second opponent until the fourth weekend of the season but the time off appeared to benefit the club. After dropping their second game of the season, the Badgers didn't lose again until December 9. Over a 14-game stretch, Wisconsin appeared to be unbeatable. Robbie Earl and Joe Pavelski led a solid offense but it was on the back end that the Badgers made their mark. As soon as he assumed the starting role, Elliot was nigh impossible to beat in goal. Through the first 16 games of the season, he allowed more than 2 goals in just 1 game and was leading the nation with a sparkling 1.38 goals against average. During that stretch, the Badgers had gone 7–0–1 against ranked teams, including two separate top-ranked clubs. The result was that by December, Wisconsin was the unanimous #1 team in the nation. A surprising loss to lowly Michigan Tech ended their streak but the Badgers won the next five game afterwards to pad their résumé.\nWith Wisconsin cruising to the top seed and Brian Elliott seemingly a shoe-in for the Hobey Baker Award, the team was dealt a serious blow in mid-January. After sweeping #5 Colorado College, Elliott was injured at practice when a teammate slid into him. The goalie was ruled out for 3–4 weeks and it fell to freshman backup Shane Connelly to hold the fort until then. Much to their misfortune, Wisconsin's next four games were against ranked teams and the Badgers fell in each match. After being thrown into the fire, Connelly recovered to earn three wins over his next four games before Elliott was finally able to return. Unfortunately, it took Elliott more than a week to get back into game shape and he ended up allowing 17 goals over a 3-game stretch, a little more than half of the 31 he had allowed in the first 22 games. With the Badgers unable to win a conference title at the time, the final weekend of the season would only serve as a tune-up for the postseason. Luckily, Elliott appeared to have regained his early-season form by allowing just 1 goal against a ranked St. Cloud State squad.\nConference tournament.\nThe Badgers opened against Michigan Tech and completely dominated both games. While the score was close in the second affair, Wisconsin outshot the Huskies 76–41 and controlled both games from start to finish. They met North Dakota in the semifinal and got off to a good start, scoring twice in the first 11 minutes. The Fighting Sioux fought back and over a 6-minute span, scored three goals to take the lead early in the second. The teams exchanged goals at the end of the middle frame, leaving the Badgers just one goal short with 20 minutes to play. The third was a sleepy period with no penalties or goals. Wisconsin was unable even the score and saw their chance at a conference championship fade away.\nWisconsin took their frustrations out on regular season champion Minnesota in the consolation game, posting a 4–0 victory over their long-time rival. The win helped Wisconsin earn the top overall seed for the NCAA tournament (Minnesota got the #2 seed) and were given the best possible draw for their first game.\nNCAA tournament.\nElliott continued to roll in the team's match against Bemidji State, recording his seventh shutout of the season. The next game came against Cornell and the match pitting two of the top defensive teams in the nation lived up to its billing. Elliott and the Badgers looked to be in control for extended sections of the game and the Big Red were unable to solve the Wisconsin netminder. Unfortunately, The Badgers too were unable to score as David McKee stopped all 37 shots in regulation. The two teams continued to stymie one another in overtime and the game went on into the night. Just past the mid-way point of the third overtime, Jack Skille scored the game's first goal, ending the second-longest game in Badger history in their favor. The game is also notable for being scoreless for the longest period in NCAA history (111:13).\nThe extended match didn't harm Wisconsin's tournament chances as the team had a week and a half off before the start of the Frozen Four. Wisconsin lucked into a de facto home game for the tournament as Milwaukee was host for the championship rounds. In front of a very partisan crowd, the Badgers took on Maine and looked every bit of the world-beaters that they had earlier in the year. After exchanging goals in the first, Wisconsin was outshot in the second but still managed to score two special team markers to take a solid lead. The Bears cut into their advantage in the third but a pair of goals put the game out of reach and sent Wisconsin to their first title game in 14 years.\nWith the championship on the line, Wisconsin faced off against Boston College. The Badgers pressed the Eagles all game long, forcing BC to take 10 separate minor penalties, 8 of which led to Wisconsin power plays. It was, however, Boston College who got on the board first, opening the scoring 9 minutes into the game. Robbie Earl tied the game early in the second but, despite exchanging chances, neither team was able to score for the next 28 minutes. midway through the third, while on their sixth man-advantage of the game, Wisconsin's Tom Gilbert broke the tie and gave the Badgers their first lead of the game. Two additional BC penalties helped stall the Eagles' comeback attempt and Wisconsin was able to run out the clock with a 2–1 win, capturing the program's sixth National Championship.\nBrian Elliott finished the season setting several Wisconsin records including goals against average (1.55), save percentage (.938), and shutouts (8), all of which are still program bests (as of 2022).\nSchedule and results.\n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | "

        "title": "Farnham Cricket Club",
        "text": "Farnham Cricket Club is based at Farnham in Surrey. It was founded in 1782 and for many years was a senior club due to the strength of its team, which featured Billy Beldham and John Wells. Farnham is a member of the Surrey Championship in the twenty-first century, with its first team now playing in the league's third tier Division II. The club's home stadium is at Folly Hill, on the outskirts of Farnham, directly below Farnham Castle.\nHistory.\n1780s.\nBeldham and Wells families were instrumental in the club's formation. They featured Billy Beldham and John Wells, brothers-in-law who went on to become two of England's most famous footballers. Farnham's first known match, which they won, occurred on 13 August 1782 at Odiham. Their team included J. Wells (probably James Wells, elder brother of John) and two players called Beldham, spelled \"Beldum\" on the surviving scorecard. One was almost certainly George Beldham, Billy's elder brother, and the other was probably Billy himself, then aged sixteen.\nThere are no records of Farnham matches from 1783, and only one from 1784. That was against Odiham &amp; Alton at Holt Pound Oval which is just across the county boundary in Hampshire. However, several Surrey matches were played there after it opened in 1784 as Farnham's home ground. The land belonged to Lord Stawell (1757–1820), who was a Hambledon Club member and a Farnham player. He commissioned the Beldhams to lay out the cricket pitch. The match against Odiham &amp; Alton was arranged for 30 July 1784, but there is no post-match report. The teams are known and Farnham included Stawell and the Beldham brothers. A return match was arranged at Odiham Down on 4 August but the result is unknown.\nFarnham played several matches in 1785 against opponents including Alresford and a team called Petworth, Northchapel &amp; Tillington with six of Hambledon. That was followed by three matches against Hambledon for a purse of £100. In the first match at Holt Pound, Farnham were well beaten by an innings and 119 runs. The other two matches were played at Windmill Down but records have been lost. These were played, though, because Billy Beldham recalled them when he was interviewed by James Pycroft in 1837. Farnham won at least one, and possibly both.\nIn June 1786, Hambledon declined a challenge from Farnham. On 28 July 1786, Farnham were scheduled to play against \"seven of Hambledon with four picked men from Sussex\" on Northchapel Green, near Chichester, but again the result has not been found. In other matches in 1786, Farnham played against Berkshire, Warfield (twice), a Guildford &amp; Godalming XXII, and a Godalming XII with four of Hambledon.\nLater years.\nOther famous players associated with Farnham have been Julius Caesar and Graham Thorpe. The club celebrated its bi-centenary in 1982."

        "text": "The 2011 Wimbledon Championships Men's singles final was the championship tennis match of the men's singles tournament at the 2011 Wimbledon Championships, played between Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic. This match is a significant part of the Djokovic–Nadal rivalry, as it was the fifth final in a row played between the two in the 2011 season and the first one in a major tournament that season. Nadal and Djokovic were the top two players at the time, entering the Championships as the world No. 1 and No. 2, respectively. Djokovic won all of their four previous finals in the 2011 season, while Nadal won all their five previous encounters at the majors. Nadal was also the defending champion (and two-time champion overall).\nAfter 2 hours and 28 minutes, second-seeded Djokovic defeated first-seeded Nadal 6–4, 6–1, 1–6, 6–3 to win the match. This was the first time Djokovic defeated Nadal at a major, the first of an eventual seven Wimbledon titles for Djokovic, and the first time a Serbian won a Wimbledon singles title.\nBackground.\nThe match took place on the final day of the 2011 edition of the 13-day Wimbledon Championships, held every June and July. Rafael Nadal was the world no. 1 entering Wimbledon, and was the top-seed in Wimbledon for the first time in his career. Djokovic was the world no. 2 and was seeded second. Both were in contention for the No. 1 ranking, which Djokovic gained by defeating Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinal. Nadal was going for his third Wimbledon title, while Djokovic was in a Wimbledon final for the first time in his career. Nadal came to the final with a 20-match winning streak at Wimbledon (starting from 2008) while Djokovic came to the final with a 47–1 win-loss record in the 2011 season. \nMatch.\nRafael Nadal won the pre-match coin toss and chose to receive, Novak Djokovic elected to stay. In the first nine games of the first set, both players held serve quite comfortably, without facing any break points or deuces. On the tenth game, Djokovic turned a 30–0 deficit and won the next three returning points to create a first set point for himself. A forehand unforced error by Nadal after the return granted the first set to Djokovic, 6–4. \nThe second set was one-sided. Djokovic trailed 0–30 in the first game of the set but won his next four service points and took the first game of the set. On the second game, a back unforced error mid-rally by Nadal gave Djokovic another break point. Djokovic countered a drop-shot from Nadal to break Nadal for the second time in the match for a 2–0 lead in the second set. Djokovic's second break in the set came at the sixth game, when a forehand cross-court by Djokovic forced an error from Nadal to give Djokovic a double break lead of 5–1. Djokovic successfully served to love for the second set and took it 6–1. Djokovic wasn't facing any break points or deuces during the first two sets. \nThe third set was also one-sided, this time for Nadal's side. In the first game, Djokovic managed to reduce a 40–0 deficit to 40–30, but Nadal won the next point to hold serve. On the second game, Nadal got his first break point opportunity after a forehand unforced error from Djokovic. Nadal took the break when Djokovic sent a backhand shot to the net, to give Nadal a 2–0 lead in the third set. Like in the second set, Nadal got another chance to break Djokovic when the latter again sent a forehand shot outside the singles' line to give Nadal two break points. Djokovic managed to save those break points to create the first deuce of the match, but Nadal created a third break point by forcing an error on Djokovic's forehand. Djokovic double-faulted on the third break point of the game to give Nadal a 5–1 lead in the third set. Like Djokovic in the second set, Nadal served to love for the third set to take it 6–1 and force a fourth set in the match. \nIn the fourth set momentum changed from side to side a couple of times. Nadal created a break point opportunity on the first game of the set, by forcing a backhand error on Djokovic with his forehand. Djokovic saved the break point by coming to the net in the beginning of the rally, creating the second deuce of the match. Unlike the third set, this time Djokovic managed to hold his service game eventually, when two returns of serve from Nadal went long.\nOn the second game, a drop-volley mid-rally from Djokovic created two break chances for him. He took the first one when Nadal sent a forehand shot to the net to give Djokovic a 2–0 lead in the fourth set. Nadal broke him right back, using the net with the return on his break point. Neither player managed to create a break point or a deuce in the next four games. On the eighth game of the set, while leading 4–3, Djokovic won the first three points as a returner to get three break point opportunities. Nadal managed to save the first break point with a forehand winner that landed deep on the baseline, but Djokovic took the second break opportunity with a backhand unforced error from Nadal that went long. The break gave Djokovic a 5–3 lead and a chance to serve for the match. At 30–30 in the ninth game, Djokovic served-and-volleyed to create his first championship point opportunity, which he converted after a backhand from Nadal landed out of the court. \nAfter his win, Djokovic noticeably ate some of the Centre Court grass, a ritual he has repeated every time he won the Wimbledon Championships title in upcoming years.\nStatistics.\nSource "

        "text": "The 2023 Daytona 500 was a NASCAR Cup Series race and the 65th running of the event. It was held on Sunday, February 19, 2023, at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona Beach, Florida. It was the first race of the 2023 NASCAR Cup Series. Jimmie Johnson returned to the Cup Series for Legacy Motor Club in this race. This was the longest Daytona 500 in history going 530 miles. \nRicky Stenhouse Jr., driving for JTG Daugherty Racing, won his first Daytona 500 and third career race after edging out two-time series champion Joey Logano for the lead in front of a multi-car accident on the final lap.\nReport.\nDaytona International Speedway is a race track in Daytona Beach, Florida that is one of six superspeedways, the others being Auto Club Speedway, Pocono Raceway, Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Michigan International Speedway, and Talladega Superspeedway.\nBackground.\nDaytona International Speedway is one of three superspeedways to hold NASCAR races, the other two being Atlanta Motor Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway. The standard track at Daytona International Speedway is a four-turn superspeedway that is long. The track's turns are banked at 31 degrees, while the front stretch, the location of the finish line, is banked at 18 degrees.\nQualifying.\nAlex Bowman scored the pole for the race with a time of 49.536 and a speed of . Kyle Larson earned the outside pole.\nOnly the top two cars qualify from time trials. The Duels set the lineup for positions 3–38. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd-numbered positions on pole qualifying day, while the second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even-numbered positions. Only one Open team in each Duel will qualify in this manner. Grid positions 39 and 40 are filled by the two \"Open\" (teams without a charter) cars that set the fastest times in qualifying, but did not lock in a spot in the Duels.\nThe fastest two Open team qualifiers were Jimmie Johnson and Travis Pastrana which earned them a spot in the race regardless of the outcome of the Duels.\nBluegreen Vacations Duel.\nThe Bluegreen Vacations Duels are a pair of NASCAR Cup Series races held in conjunction with the Daytona 500 annually in February at Daytona International Speedway. They consist of two races 60 laps and 150 miles (240 km) in length, which serve as heat races that set the lineup for the Daytona 500. Both races sets the lineup for positions 3–38. The first race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in odd–numbered positions on pole qualifying day with exceptions based on open teams. The second race sets the lineup for cars that qualified in even–numbered positions. Only the top finishing open car will transfer from each qualifying race. After qualifying races, the final two positions are determined by fastest times in qualifying of open teams that did not advance.\nPractice.\nFirst practice.\nJimmie Johnson was the fastest in the first practice session with a time of 46.338 seconds and a speed of .\nFinal practice.\nBrad Keselowski was the fastest in the final practice session with a time of 47.071 seconds and a speed of .\nRace.\nThe race began with Alex Bowman and Kyle Larson on the front row, The next few laps Larson and Bowman exchanged the lead.\n10 laps in, the inside line began to show it's strength, with Larson, Joey Logano, and Christopher Bell making up the top 3 of the field. A third line emerged with Bubba Wallace, Tyler Reddick and Justin Haley, but quickly faded. Smoke started billowing from Ty Dillon's car on lap 28. His team pushed him to the garage, and discovered an engine problem, making him the first driver to retire from the race.\nBetween laps 37 and 40, the drivers made their first pit stops. On lap 38 there was a spin by Riley Herbst, however NASCAR did not throw the yellow flag. After the pit cycle, Denny Hamlin took the lead, but was passed by Chase Briscoe on lap 42, as two lines have formed again. On the bottom are Briscoe, Wallace and Aric Almirola, with Hamlin, Bell and Reddick on the top. On lap 55, Wallace had taken the lead but made contact with the backstretch wall after a push from Hamlin and Martin Truex Jr.\nOn lap 64, two laps from the end of the first stage, A. J. Allmendinger, who was one lap down at the time, blocked and slowed the inside line led by Almirola and Jimmie Johnson, with the intention of getting the free pass at the stage break, leading the top lane, now led by Brad Keselowski and Ryan Preece, to pass Hamlin and Truex. They were followed by Chris Buescher and Kevin Harvick. Keselowski would win the first stage.\nThe race restarts on lap 72, with Keselowski dropping to the inside to block Preece. Truex and Kyle Busch move to lead the outside line on lap 94, but it has no effect. After another sequence of pit stops, the pack went three wide on lap 112, with Logano and Ryan Blaney leading the race. On lap 117, Harvick bumped Reddick, causing a multi-car incident, the first of many, which would involve almost a dozen cars. Reddick, Erik Jones and Chase Elliott retired from the race, while Blaney received repairs on his right front. The leaders took advantage of the pit stops, with Cindric and Hamlin pitting for two tires while all other teams took four. The race restarted on lap 126, with a group of drivers preferring track position and stage points. Ross Chastain gets down to take the lead from Logano. He begins to block both lines, while Alex Bowman is strong on the outside line with a push from Ricky Stenhouse Jr. Chastain would win the second stage due to a late push from Truex and Logano, in a close finish against Bowman. \nDuring the yellow flag at the end of the second stage, pit stops occurred place, with Chastain getting penalized for going too fast exiting pit lane. Bell was also penalized for passing over equipment, and rookie Noah Gragson was as well for an uncontrolled tire. All three would serve pass-throughs. Wallace stayed out of the pits and would takes the lead of the race at the lap 138 restart. Almirola would overtake him after a push from Buescher, though the yellow flag would come out for debris two laps later, with the right front tire tread coming off Blaney's car in turn two.\nAlmirola was strong on the inside line on the restart, receiving strong drafting help from Buescher. Wallace tried to stick the middle lane, but wound up losing the draft. On lap 145, Buescher moved up to the outside line with a push from teammate and co-owner Keselowski. They would go on to strongly lead the outside lane as laps go by and the inside line led by Hamlin gains no ground. Wallace's gamble of staying out on the stage break would not pay off, as he pitted for fuel alone with 30 laps to go, and would fall a lap down.\nBetween laps 176 and 180, drivers began making their final pit stops, with Harrison Burton taking the lead after the cycle. Stenhouse is penalized for speeding, having to make a pass-through on lap 180. With 18 laps to go, the first Big One takes place, with Preece losing control and making a heavy impact on the wall before collecting Harvick, Truex, Johnson, and Chase Briscoe. The race restarts with 14 laps to go, with Burton leading on the outside pushed by Busch, and Logano on the inside with William Byron. Logano would get loose on the straightaway, forcing him up to the outside, losing the draft. A dive-bomb move from Allmendinger would thrust him into the lead until he was overtaken by Keselowski with 10 laps to go.\nWith laps winding down, both RFK Racing cars of Keselowski and Buscher and the Richard Childress Racing cars of Busch and Austin Dillon remained close each other. With four laps to go, the RCR drivers coordinated with Byron on the back straight to pass Keselowski and Buescher, with Busch taking the lead, looking for his first Daytona 500 victory in his 18th attempt. But on the next lap, Suarez gets a touch from Johnson, sending him spinning at the exit of turn 4, and with this the race went into overtime.\nAfter radio communications on how to take advantage of having his two cars in the first two positions, Richard Childress decided Dillon slow the inside line on the restart, to protect Busch, who would immediately switch into that line, in order to command a 1-2 finish for RCR. However, the inside line would lose pace with Logano and Stenhouse passing both cars. On the back straight, Stenhouse, with a push from Larson, passed Logano, and the yellow flag was waved seconds later for another Big One, caused by Byron's touch on Dillon who spun up the track collecting Cindric, Burton, Hamlin, Johnson, Gragson, Todd Gilliland, and Zane Smith.\nBoth RFK Racing drivers pitted for fuel, in the case that the race could extend into several additional overtimes. Herbst and Almirola also pitted at this time.\nThe race restarted for a second overtime on lap 210, with Stenhouse leading on the outside and Larson on the inside. Stenhouse grew his lead to a stable amount coming to the white flag, blocking the inside line, leaving Larson without a draft. In turn 2, Almirola bumped Travis Pastrana who lost control and spun, creating the third Big One with Keselowski, Almirola, Busch, Wallace, Allmendinger and Hamlin involved, and the yellow flag was quickly waved, ending the race as the white flag had already flown, with Stenhouse in the lead.\nThis was confirmed by NASCAR using video replay, confirming that Ricky Stenhouse Jr, driving the No. 47 car for JTG Daugherty Racing, was the winner of the 2023 Daytona 500.\nRace results.\nStage Results.\nStage One\n\"Laps:\" 65\nStage Two\n\"Laps:\" 65\nFinal Stage Results.\nStage Three\n\"Laps:\" 70\nMedia.\nTelevision.\nSince 2001—with the exception of 2002, 2004 and 2006—the Daytona 500 has been carried by Fox in the United States.

        "text": "The UCI Gravel World Championships are the world championship events for gravel cycling organized by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI). The discipline covers the space between standard road cycling on paved and asphalted roads, and the all-terrain disciplines of mountain bike cross-country and cyclo-cross. The races share the length and tactical nature of road racing parcours, but embrace the unpredictability and technical skill of off-road cycling.\nThe first three finishers in each discipline at the World Championships are awarded gold, silver, and bronze medals. The winner of each discipline is also entitled to wear the rainbow jersey in events of the same discipline until the following year's World Championships. Unlike other UCI-sanctioned races, the competitors in the World Championships represent national rather than commercial teams. The World Championships are usually held towards the end of the season.\nHistory.\nThe first UCI Gravel World Championships took place in Veneto, Italy in 2022 and featured only cross-country events. The inaugural world champions were Pauline Ferrand-Prévot for the women's race and Gianni Vermeersch for the men's race."

A member of the main board of the ruling populist Serbian Progressive Party (SNS), Mandić is considered to be the man in charge of the \"confidential affairs\" of the party.\nCareer.\nMandić was born on 10 February 1980 in Sarajevo, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia. He moved to Belgrade in the early 1990s.\nClub.\nHe started his career in Crvena zvezda (Red Star) where he was a champion with cadets, juniors and seniors. From Crvena zvezda he moved to their rival Partizan. Then numerous titles followed. Already in 1998, he won the national cup, and the following year the championship of FR Yugoslavia. Two years later, with Partizan, he won the Cup again, and in 2002 and 2003, he became national champion twice in a row.\nIn 2004, he signed for Magdeburg, with whom he played in the semi-finals of the EHF Champions League. After Magdeburg, he returned to Serbian handball and signed for Vojvodina, with which he became the champion of Serbia and Montenegro in the 2004/05 season. In 2006, he played for Altea, but soon left the club and took a break in his handball career due to family problems. He returned to handball and signed for Vojvodina once again, with which he won the Serbian Cup in the 2010/11 season.\nIn May 2011, he announced that he was returning to Partizan for the 2011/12 season. Season 2011/12 was extremely successful for Partizan, with whom Mandić won the Championship, Cup and Supercup of Serbia and participated in the group stage of the Champions League. After a great season in which he won three trophies, Mandic announced that he was retiring. In January 2014, he returned to handball and joined Partizan in the desire to help the club win the title. However, that season, Partizan did not manage to win the title, and Mandić definitely decided to retire.\nInternational.\nMandić played for the FR Yugoslavia national team at the 2003 World Championship in Portugal. In total, he played 45 games for the national team.\n2002 murder accusation.\nHe was accused of assisting in the attempted murder of his father's former driver Dejan Marković in 2002. According to the indictment, Mandić lured Dejan Marković, the former driver of his father Momčilo Mandić to Ušće where his cousin Draženko Mandić wounded him. In 2016, the Court of Appeal acquitted Mandić of attempted murder.\nBusiness and political activities.\nFollowing his retirement from handball, Mandić became a successful businessman. Mandić is a member of the main board of the ruling populist Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) and considered to be the man in charge of the \"confidential affairs\" of the party, such as dispersal of protests and rallies of opposition parties in Serbia.\nDuring the local elections campaign in Nikšić, Montenegro, in February 2021, Mandić was detained along with eight other people after he was allegedly involved in the pre-election campaign in Nikšić and logistically and financially helping the \"For the Future of Nikšić\" coalition. In late September 2022, prior to the Republika Srpska general election, Mandić was detained in Banja Luka along with Adam Šukalo, also a high-ranking member of SNS. They were released from custody shortly after. It has been alleged that their arrest was directly ordered by Milorad Dodik, presidency member of Bosnia and Herzegovina and president of the Alliance of Independent Social Democrats (SNSD), as Mandić and Šukalo were allegedly organizing vote buying on behalf of the opposition in Republika Srpska under the orders of Aleksandar Vučić in order to topple Dodik. He was banned entry to Montenegro on 14 October 2022 for \"national security reasons\".\nPersonal life.\nHis father Momčilo is an influential business and political figure and served as justice minister of Republika Srpska in 1992 during the Bosnian War. Momčilo Mandić was elected member of the National Assembly of Serbia in the 2016 parliamentary election on the electoral list of the ultranationalist Serbian Radical Party (SRS).\nMandić has four children."

        "text": "The 2022 Breeders' Cup World Championships was the 39th edition of the premier event of the North American Thoroughbred horse racing year. The 14 races, all of which were Grade I, took place on November 4 and 5 at Keeneland racetrack in Lexington, Kentucky. In the United States, the races were telecast on Friday and early Saturday by USA Network and FanDuel TV, with NBC covering the last three races on Saturday. In the United Kingdom, ITV broadcast all the races live, with day 1 on ITV3 and day 2 on ITV4.\nThe Breeders' Cup is generally regarded as the end of the North American racing season, although a few Grade I events take place in later November and December. The event typically determines champions in many of the Eclipse Award divisions.\nQualifying.\nA maximum of 14 horses (12 in the Dirt Mile and Juvenile Turf Sprint) were allowed to start in each race. Horses could automatically qualify by winning one of the designated races in the Breeders' Cup Challenge series, which provide \"Win and You're In\" berths in a specified division of the Breeders' Cup. Other pre-entries were ranked by a points system and the judgement of a panel of experts. \nOn October 26, 205 horses were pre-entered in the various races, 46 of which qualified via the Challenge series. The entries include 73 Grade/Group 1 winners and 45 horses from overseas. Most of the races had full fields. However, two of the most highly anticipated events (the Classic and Distaff) had smaller fields that included most of the top-ranked horses in the United States, including Flightline, Life Is Good and Epicenter in the Classic, and Nest and Malathaat in the Distaff.\nEvent preparation.\nKeeneland hosted the Breeders' Cup for the third time. They first hosted the event in 2015 when American Pharoah finished his career by winning the Classic after having won the American Triple Crown. The 2020 event at Keeneland though was held without spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Fans who had purchased tickets for that event were given first preference for seating at the 2022 event. Keeneland installed temporary seating, including five \"chalets\" and loge boxes, to increase their normal capacity of about 20,000 to 45,000 people.\nRaces.\nThe official sequence of the Breeders' Cup races was announced on October 26. The betting menu included an All-Turf Pick 3 on Friday, an All-Turf Pick 4 on Saturday and three special \"daily doubles\" where a bettor needed to pick the winner of one race on Friday and the corresponding race on Saturday for older horses: Juvenile Fillies/Distaff, Juvenile/Classic and Juvenile Turf/Turf.\nFriday, November 4.\nTwo horses, Forte and the filly Wonder Wheel, likely wrapped up Eclipse Awards by winning the Juvenile and Juvenile Fillies respectively. Forte, who had previously won the Hopeful Stakes and Breeders' Futurity, beat the heavily favored Cave Rock with a come-from-behind stretch drive. Similarly, Wonder Wheel was well back in the early run but closed well to win by three lengths – the largest winning margin in the day's Breeders' Cup races. \nAll three turf races were won by Irish-bred horses. Trainer Aidan O'Brien won two races for Coolmore – the Juvenile Fillies Turf with Meditate and the Juvenile Turf with Victoria Road – and trainer Charlie Appleby won the Juvenile Turf Sprint with Mischief Magic for Godolphin.\nA record $49.27 million was bet on the five Breeders' Cup races, a 16.4% increase over the record set in 2021 for Friday betting. Only one favorite won on the day but there were no major upsets. Nonetheless, the Pick 5 returned $2,428.02 for a 50 cent bet.\nAn asterisk after the odds means the winner was the post-time favorite\nSource: Equibase charts for Friday, November 4\nLegend:\n \nSaturday, November 5.\nIn winning the Classic by a record lengths, Flightline all but guaranteed he would earn American Horse of the Year honors, as well as the older male horse title. Malathaat also wrapped up the Eclipse Award for older fillies and mares by winning the Distaff in a three-way photo finish with Blue Stripe and Clairiere, while Goodnight Olive is likely to be named the female sprint Champion after her win in the Filly &amp; Mare Sprint. However, the male sprint Champion title is undecided after heavy favorite Jackie's Warrior was beaten by Elite Power in the Sprint. Cody's Wish may also be considered for the title after his win in the Dirt Mile.\nIn the Turf races, European-bred horses were once again dominant, though Pennsylvania-bred Caravel did manage to win the Turf Sprint in the day's biggest upset. Aidan O'Brien and Coolmore won the Filly &amp; Mare Turf with Tuesday, while Charlie Appleby and Godolphin won the Mile and Turf with Modern Games and Rebel's Romance respectively. O'Brien and Appleby tied as the leading trainers over the two-day card with three wins each. Ryan Moore won the Shoemaker Award, having ridden Coolmore's three winners over the weekend, plus three seconds (Stone Age in the Turf, Emaraaty Ana in the Turf Sprint and Dramatised in the Juvenile Turf Sprint).\nThe all-sources handle was a record $189 million over the two days, up 3.4% over the previous record set in 2021. \nAn asterisk after the odds means the winner was the post-time favorite\nSource: Equibase charts for Saturday, November 5\nLegend:\n "

For instance, a loose 'club cut' offering relaxed fit for recreational cyclists, and a form-fitting 'race cut' featuring a tailored fit that is tighter and shorter. Jerseys for other cycling disciplines such as mountain biking have different characteristics. Looser jerseys allow body armour to be worn beneath. Long sleeve options also provide additional protection against branches and twigs.\nProfessional cycling is heavily sponsored. Regulations specify the size, colour and the placement of sponsor, national federation and manufacturer logos and other graphics. In professional races, certain colours or patterns have special symbolism that signify the leader or the champion of a race or tour. Numbers are pinned on the back of the jersey for a race."

The UCI specify the kit and the design the riders use.\nCycling kits have evolved significantly since the early days of the sport when participants wore wool jerseys. Recent advances in manufacturing and technology have enabled lighter, more comfortable, colourful and complex designs to be made. Cycling kits nowadays are made primarily with synthetic materials, such as Lycra, which conforms to the body, thereby reducing drag by eliminating loose fabric as well as increase in comfort. Made-to-order custom kits with tailored cuts made to order are becoming increasingly common for individuals, clubs and teams to produce kits with custom designs. Notable brands include Adidas, Castelli, Pearl Izumi, Rapha and Santini SMS.\nCycling kits in professional races are usually featured with sponsor logos and advertising, and specific colours and/or patterns signify certain position or a leader in a race. In a race, cyclists pin number tags of the race on the back of the jersey (and another on the bike). To generate revenue for the professional teams, replica kits are generally made available for fans to purchase.\nEquipment for the cyclist.\nBasic equipment.\nThe basic equipment set out in the UCI technical regulation guide (Section 3: riders’ clothing) includes a jersey with sleeves, a pair of shorts and possibly a skinsuit.\nGenerally speaking, the typical summer cycling kit (whether racing or not) consists of:\nand in spring/autumn the additional pieces:\nand in winter the additional pieces:\nAccessories.\nThe following optional pieces can be worn by the cyclist for additional comfort or performance monitoring:\nSee also.\nCycling in general\nCycling as a sport\nExercise clothing and fabrics"

On March 6, the University of San Diego announced that they had released Sam Scholl as head coach. Then, on April 6, USD announced that Steve Lavin, who previously had coached at both UCLA and St. John's, had been hired as the new head coach. Due to Todd Golden accepting the position as basketball coach at the University of Florida, San Francisco also had a coaching change.

Therefore, BYU will remain a member of the WCC for the current season, with the WCC potentially dropping to 9 teams for the 2023-24 season. West Coast Conference commissioner Gloria Nevarez indicated that the conference is open to adding additional schools to the conference to ensure \"continued success\" for the league.\nRegular season.\nEarly season tournaments.\nThe following table summarizes the multiple-team events (MTE) or early season tournaments in which teams from the West Coast Conference will participate.\nWCC Player/Freshman of the Week.\nThroughout the year, the West Coast Conference names a player of the week and a freshman of the week as follows:\nAll-WCC Awards and Teams.\nOn March 2, 2022, the West Coast Conference announced the following awards:"

Starting center Adama Faye led the league in rebounds with an average of 12.2 boards per game to go with his 11.4 points per game for a double-double average.\nRoster.\nUST has listed Ivanne Callum and Trevor Valera on their reserve list, where either player can be activated to replace players who would test positive for COVID-19.\n&lt;section begin=\"Roster\" /&gt;\n&lt;includeonly&gt;Depth chart&lt;/includeonly&gt;\n&lt;section end=\"Roster\" /&gt;\nRoster changes.\nThe Growling Tigers have enlisted six rookies in their lineup in the wake of some offseason developments. Veterans Sherwin Concepcion and Bryan Santos were ruled ineligible by the UAAP board for having exceeded the league's age limit. The league relaxed the rules for graduating players in the belatedly-run Season 84, but had reverted them in the succeeding season which began only a few months after. Concepcion and Santos led the Tigers to the 3x3 championship last June.\nDave Ando, the team's starting center, left the team after deciding to play in the FIBA 3x3 Professional Circuit.\nNew head coach Bal David was able to recruit the sons of retired PBA players, Kenneth Duremdes, Ricky Calimag, and Eddie Laure through a scouting trip with assistant coach Rodney Santos in the United States. Siblings Kenji Duremdes and Kylle Magdangal, along with Calimag's son Richi agreed to suit up for the Tigers this season, as Laure's son Echo gave his commitment a month earlier.\nCalimag averaged 13.6 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.5 steals for the Diamond Bar Brahmas. He scored 13 points in their team's loss against Glendora High School in the championship game of the 2021 Gary Prestesater Classic. Magdangal averaged 10.0 points, 5.9 rebounds and 4.3 assists for the Marina High School Vikings. He scored 11 points as Marina advanced to the 2021 CIF Southern Section Finals. Duremdes and Laure were playing as rookies for the NSNU Bullpups before the pandemic and were not able to play in their senior year due to tournament cancellations. Duremdes averaged 3.1 points and 2.3 rebounds, while Laure made 3.3 points and 3.4 rebounds per game as an 11th grader.\nAlso suiting up for the first time were Soysoy Escobido, Ivan Lazarte, and Kendall Valentin. Escobido transferred to UST from Don Bosco Technical College–Cebu for his senior high school year, but like Duremdes and Laure, he wasn't able to play due to league suspension in light of the COVID pandemic. He averaged 10.0 points per game in the 2019 MYBL-Cebu. Lazarte, who was a reserve player for the Tigers last season, came from the 2018 NCAA juniors champion Malayan Red Robins, while Valentin was recruited out of the Adamson Baby Falcons' basketball program, where he played in the 3x3 tournaments.\nThe Tigers have also regained a replacement for Season 82 MVP Soulémane Chabi Yo, who left the team before the start of Season 84 to play professionally in Europe. Adama Faye was already eligible for the season after completing his year-long residency, but had gone to his home country in Senegal and had failed to come back in time for the tournament. Faye was able to rejoin the team this season.\nCoaching changes.\nBal David replaced Jino Manansala as the head coach of the Growling Tigers on July 22, 2022. The coaching change was confirmed by UST's Institute of Physical Education and Athletics head Fr. Rodel Cansancio.\nManansala was earlier reassigned to coach the Tiger Cubs, the school's juniors basketball program after McJour Luib, the former coach tendered his resignation at the end of the Season 84 basketball tournament. Luib was Manansala's chief deputy at the senior squad. Apart from the Tigers' losing season, where the team finished with only three wins, the inability to reinstate former coach Aldin Ayo led to the resignation of the majority of Manansala's assistant coaches.\nDavid has already applied for the coaching position back in 2017 following Boy Sablan's end of tenure in the aftermath of the Tigers' 1–13 season, but Ayo eventually got the position. His coaching staff consists of retired PBA players Rodney Santos and Ronald Magtulis, two of his teammates from his Ginebra playing years; Richard Melencio, David's teammate from the 1994 UST champion team; former UST Tiger Cubs coaches Jon Villanueva and David's brother Bernie.\nSchedule and results.\nPreseason tournaments.\nUST recorded the second biggest winning margin in the history of the PBA D-League when they won by 71 points over the AMA University Titans, 150–79. Sherwin Concepcion finished with a triple-double of 14 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists.\nThe PBA D-League games were aired on One Sports and PBA Rush, while the Filoil EcoOil Preseason Cup games were aired via livestream on Smart Sports' Facebook page.\nUAAP games.\nElimination games were played in a double round-robin format and, except for their second-round game against the Ateneo Blue Eagles on November 17, 2022, all of UST's games were televised on One Sports and the UAAP Varsity Channel.\nSummary.\nThe rebuilding Growling Tigers were ranked last among the eight UAAP teams by ESPN Philippines with a C rating. Even with a good showing in their preseason tournaments, the loss of their veterans to ineligibility issues and the appointment of a new head coach puts a lot of uncertainties in the team's campaign this year. Sophomores Nic Cabañero and Paul Manalang, only a few months detached from their rookie season of the belatedly-ran Season 84 have now been thrust into the leadership roles in the absence of Joshua Fontanilla, Sherwin Concepcion and Bryan Santos. Cabañero had an impressive showing in the preseason, averaging 16.8 points per game in the PBA D-League, and 14.9 points per game in the Filoil EcoOil tournament.\nCabañero scored a career-high 33 points in their 69–60 win over the Adamson Falcons. The Falcons had threatened within three points in the last 41.6 seconds before Cabañero converted on a step-back jumper to beat the shot clock. The Tigers went successful in defending Adamson's Jerom Lastimosa who scored only ten points in the game as he failed a three-point shot attempt while trailing 60–63.\nAfter a high-scoring first half of play, both UST and Adamson went lethargic, scoring only six and four points, respectively to end the third period. The two squads shared a combined total of 14 turnovers in the ten-minute duration. UST was able to pick up their offense and increase their lead to ten after outscoring the Falcons, 61-51, four minutes into the fourth quarter.\nCabañero, who was celebrating his 19th birthday in a few days tallied a high field goal percentage of 72.2 on a 13-of-18 clip. His 33-point output was the highest individual score by a Tiger since Kean Baclaan scored 35 points in their preseason game in August.\nAfter the first round of eliminations, Cabañero was the second overall leader in scoring behind La Salle's Schonny Winston. His seven-game averages were 17.7 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.1 assists per game, with a 16.1 player efficiency rating. Faye's 11.7 points, 9.7 rebounds, and 1.7 blocks per game nets him a higher efficiency rating of 17.0.\nComing out into their second game of the season, Cabañero had become a marked man as the De La Salle Green Archers' defense held him down to just 10 points on a 5 of 20 shooting. The Archers came out with a strong start and led by as many as 12 points in the first period to close out with a 30–21 lead. The Tigers began the second quarter with a 12–3 run to come within one at 32–33, but La Salle regained steam and ended the half on a seven-point lead.\nThe Tigers went anemic again in the third period as the Archers limited their scoring to only six points to end the quarter with a 19-point deficit. The game got blown away as La Salle built a huge 24-point lead with still 4:18 left in the game in the final period.\nAfter a close-scoring first half, the Tigers were dealt with a 0–12 scoring run by the Ateneo Blue Eagles to widen the lead from just one point to 13 at 32–45. UST could only manage to score 11 points as the quarter ended with the team trailing by 14 points at 43–57. Their scoring drought continued as they could only come up with 9 points in the payoff period as Ateneo's lead swelled to as high as 29 points.\nThe Tigers were able to keep up early in the game due to their tough physical defense on the Eagles, but the ploy backfired when Faye was called for his fifth foul with still 3:11 left in the third quarter.\nThe Tigers closed out the first round of eliminations with a 25-point loss to the UP Fighting Maroons and extended their losing streak to six games. The game started with the Maroons igniting a 14–2 run as UST finished the first period with only 8 points.\nUST tried to mount a comeback with a 20–3 run to cut the deficit to 11 from a high of 28 in the last five minutes. Cabañero scored ten straight points in that period to rally his team after being down, 29–57, but UP countered with their own 16–2 run to end the game at 76–51.\nThe Tigers' poor shot selection resulted to a low 27.9 field goal percentage, in contrast to the Maroons' 41.8 stat line.\nDespite Adama Faye's double-double game of 23 points and 18 rebounds, the Tigers fared miserably as they surrendered a 30-point loss to the UE Red Warriors. The Warriors who were coming off a three-game losing streak held UST to a nine-point second quarter scoring to end the half with a 22-point 45–23 lead.\nThe Tigers could not get their shots to drop, making only 18 of their 66 attempts for a 27.3 field goal percentage. UE's tough defense limited Nic Cabañero to a season-low of seven points on a 2-of-15 shooting percentage.\nThe Warriors blew the game wide open in the second half with UE's CJ Payawal burying five three-point shots and then capped by Harvey Pagsanjan's own three for the game's biggest lead at 34, 43.1 seconds remaining in the game. UST slid down to their seventh straight loss for a 1–7 record.\nThe Tigers began the game on a strong 10–3 scoring before Ateneo got going with 19 straight points and kept UST scoreless to end the first period at 10–22. Cabañero pushed his team back to a single digit deficit of eight points from a high of 14 to end the half at 27–35. The sophomore guard had already tallied 11 points, 5 rebounds, and 4 assists in only two quarters of play.\nThe Tigers found themselves on the losing end of a 5–19 run by the Blue Eagles at the start of the second half, where they managed to only score 10 points for the third period. By then, Ateneo's lead had swelled to 25 points. UST rallied back in the final quarter to come within eight points, as they held Ateneo to only ten points, but their efforts fell short with the game ending on another loss for the Tigers. Cabañero finished the match with 26 points, 8 rebounds, and 7 assists. Adama Faye, meanwhile had another double-double of 10 points and 11 rebounds.\nThe Tigers extended their losing streak to 11 games after an 18-point loss to the UP Fighting Maroons. The match was close in the first half with UST gaining a 1-point advantage at the end of the first period, and were trailing the Maroons by only three points at the halftime break. The deficit had remained at three points until midway of the third quarter when UP's Cyril Gonzales and Joel Cagulangan ignited a 15–5 run for a 13-point 52–39 lead over the Tigers.\nUST went scoreless at the start of the fourth period as the Maroons piled up 11 straight points for a 70–49 count. A 4–2 run by UP in the succeeding play widened the deficit to 23 points with still 6:13 left in the game. The Tigers committed a total of 23 turnovers, giving UP 22 points in transition baskets. Cabañero led UST with 14 points, while Faye had another double-double of 12 points and 11 rebounds.\nThe Tigers lost their first-round game against the NU Bulldogs, 63–69. After trailing NU by 2 points at the end of the first period, UST went on a nine-point second quarter scoring drought. They made a recovery in the second half to come within eight points after Jamba Garing converted on a fast break at the 2:38 mark in the third period. The Bulldogs countered with an 18–8 run that stretched from the end of the quarter until the payoff period for an 18-point 62–44 lead. UST answered back with a 19–5 run and held NU scoreless for the next seven minutes. Nic Cabañero's pull-up triple pulled his team to within three points at 63–67, 10.2 seconds remaining.\nThe Tigers fouled NU's John Lloyd Clemente in the next play to stop the clock at 7.6 seconds. Clemente converted both free throws for the final count of 69–63. UST's run came by way of fast break points, at the same time preventing the Bulldogs from running which resulted to zero fast break points on their end. They, however shot horribly from the perimeter, missing 14 out of their 16 three point shot attempts, and converting only 24-of-65 field goals. The Tigers also did poorly in free throws, with Cabañero making only 5 out of 11, four of which he missed during the crucial stretch in the fourth period.\nThe tandem of Cabañero and Faye registered double-doubles, with the Senegalese center making a career-high 20 points and 10 rebounds. Cabañero chipped in 16 points and 12 rebounds in the Tigers' second stright loss.\nUST's 68–78 first-round loss to UE was the first time that the Warriors defeated them since October 7, 2017. The Tigers were leading in the first two quarters, until UE's Jojo Antiporda came out firing threes to pull his team ahead. UST was trailing UE by six points when Adama Faye got called for a disqualifying foul on Harvey Pagsanjan in the 2:01 mark of the third period. Replays showed Faye throwing an elbow at Pagsanjan during a rebounding scuffle which resulted to a one-game suspension, effective on their next game against the FEU Tamaraws.\nThe Tigers' tried to make up for the absence of their center, as Cabañero came up with another double-double of 19 points and 14 rebounds. The Warriors were still within sight with 1:28 left in the game, leading only by three points, until UE's Luis Villegas sparked a 14–4 run to put the game away and handed UST a ten-point 68–78 loss.\nThe Growling Tigers blew a 19-point lead against Adamson in their second-round game and lost, 55–56. After a 6–4 lead at the start by the Falcons, UST took control of the rest of the first half by outscoring their opponents, 17–11 in the first quarter, and limiting them to only 8 points in the second quarter for a 12-point 31–19 score. They were leading until midway of the third period as a result of Nic Cabañero's three-straight triples and Jamba Garing’s transition three to bring the score to 47–28. Adamson began a 19–3 uprising that lasted until the 6:15 mark of the final quarter and brought down UST's lead to two at 50–48.\nThe Tigers had managed to hold on to their 2-point lead until the final 7.1 seconds when Adamson's Cedrick Manzano was fouled by Migs Pangilinan for a three-point play. Garing missed his shot in the next possession as players from both squads scrambled for the rebound. The ball went to Cabañero's hands, but the buzzer had sounded before he was able to release his shot. He topscored for the Tigers with 22 points, but as the Falcons defended him with a double-team, no other player could step up and UST ended up scoring only five points in the fourth quarter.\nThe Tigers lost for the 12th straight time as the FEU Tamaraws handed them a 15-point 62–77 defeat in their second-round game. Down by seven points after the first period, UST went toe-to-toe to match their opponents' output of 16 points in the second quarter to close the half at 33–40. They then buckled down to work to begin the second half on a 10–2 run as they took the upperhand with a 43–42 lead off a surprise triple from Echo Laure. The Tigers would then run out of firepower and allow FEU to counter with their own 14–2 run to end the third period with an 11-point deficit. The Tamaraws' Patrick Sleat scored all of his 9 points in that stretch. UST rallied back to come within seven at 53–60, with 6:40 remaining in the game, but FEU's Xyrus Torres and Bryan Sajonia rained down three straight triples to spearhead a 12–0 run. Pat Tchuente's basket extended FEU's lead to 19, with 3:06 left.\nAdama Faye posted another double-double of 10 points with a game-high of 18 rebounds, while Ivan Lazarte led in socring with 13 points. The Tigers played without their leading scorer Nic Cabañero, as he sat out due to an ankle sprain that he incurred during their last game against UP.\nRoyce Mantua's breakout game was not enough to stabilize the Tigers's run as they lost to the De La Salle Green Archers, 72–77 in their last game of the season and crashed out on a 13-game losing streak. UST had led throughout the game until the final two minutes as they went scoreless for more than eight minutes.\nThe Tigers were leading by four points at 59–55 after three quarters, until Mantua's three-point shot at the 8:26 mark pushed the team to their biggest lead at 69–60. It was at this juncture when the coaching staff called Cabañero and Faye to the bench to rest. Their second stringers could not convert, resulting to UST's scoring drought. The Archers, on the other hand, shot nine unanswered baskets, with La Salle's Jcee Macalalag giving his team a two-point lead with 1:50 remaining in the game. Two free throw conversions by the Archers' Ben Phillips, off Christian Manaytay's foul extended their run to 11.\nBy the time Cabañero and Faye checked back in to replace the inexperienced pair of Kenji Duremdes and Echo Laure, their shooting hands were noticeably ice-cold. Faye, in particular, committed a crucial error with 20.9 seconds remaining as he was made to receive a side-court inbound from outside the three-point arc. With UST trailing, 70–73, Faye dribbled on his foot which resulted to a costly turnover. The Archers scored four straight points as team captain Paul Manalang and Jamba Garing, who was playing his last game in a Tigers uniform got their shots blocked while driving to the basket. A last-second triple by Richi Calimag gave UST their lone field goal since Mantua's basket early in the quarter.\nMantua topscored with 17 points, on a 5 of 7 three-point shot field goal. Cabañero, who had come off the bench while still nursing a sprain, added 16 points and 4 timely assists to Mantua and Ivan Lazarte that resulted to three-point shot conversions.\nThe Tigers' 57–67 second-round loss to the NU Bulldogs enabled their opponents to enter the Final Four for the first time since the 2015 season. UST, in contrast was eliminated from the playoffs for the second straight year after suffering their tenth straight defeat. This marked the first time for the team to incur a double-digit losing streak since 2017, when they began the season with 13 staight losses that brought their streak to 17, adding to their 4 consecutive defeats from the preceding 2016 season.\nUST had the game in control in the first half, leading by as high as 11 points on a 42.4 field goal percentage. Nic Cabañero had already scored 13 of his team-high 20 points in only two quarters of play, but the Bulldogs sprang on them at the start of the second half with eight unanswered points. The Bulldogs' John Lloyd Clemente and Kean Baclaan scored back-to-back three-point shots to wrest the Tigers' lead at 38–37. The Tigers went scoreless for five minutes as they were outscored by their opponents in the third quarter, 8–15.\nThey rallied back in the final period to retake the lead by two at 54–52, but the Bulldogs made a run of their own, outscoring the Tigers, 15–3.\nUAAP statistics.\nSource: Imperium Technology\nPlayers drafted into the PBA.\nIan Herrera was picked 67th overall in the seventh round of the 2023 PBA draft by the Bonnie Tan-led NorthPort Batang Pier team on September 17, 2023."

However, on 11 May 2023, a Test and a T20I was dropped from the itinerary, due to scheduling problems. On 17 May 2023, Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) confirmed the dates and venues for the series.\nBangladesh won the only Test by 546 runs.

Then the league divides into two groups: the top six teams will progress to Group A and the remaining seven teams will progress to Group B. The teams play the other members of their groups once more, meaning Group A teams play a further five games and Group B teams play a further six.\nAs before, eight teams will progress through to the playoffs, meaning the top two teams from Group B will qualify along with the six teams from Group A.\nAs the division has an extra team, two teams will be automatically relegated (instead of one) and the team finishing eleventh will contest a playoff against the runner-up from the División B playoffs.\nThe division is made up of thirteen teams this season instead of the usual twelve after controversy during the 2021-22 season.\nLa Vila and Gernika finished eleventh and twelfth in 2021-22, but Alcobendas were automatically relegated for fielding an ineligible player. This earned La Vila a reprieve from relegation. Initially, Gernika were set to be relegated, but they argued that Alcobendas' point reduction meant the Madrid side technically finished bottom, and that they were therefore denied their rightful opportunity to play off against the runner-up from the Division B playoffs, Belenos RC.\nThe Spanish Rugby Federation ruled that denying either team - Gernika or Belenos - a place in the top flight would be unfair.\nPromotion and relegation.\nThe second-tier División de Honor B is made up of three regional groups.

With a 15–8–5 record, going 9–12–3 in conference play, the Eagles finished eighth in Hockey East and failed to secure a berth to the NCAA tournament. Despite a relatively strong start to the year in which they brought trophies home from both the Ice Breaker tournament and Ledyard Bank Classic, the Eagles suffered a 12-game winless streak to start the 2nd half of the year. During that stretch, they fell in the Beanpot opener to Northeastern and tied with Harvard for 3rd place (the first of its kind in tournament history). The postseason only saw the Eagles advance to the Quarterfinals of the Hockey East tournament; after beating New Hampshire in the Opening Round, Northeastern defeated Boston College to deny them a trip to the semi-finals.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | Exhibition\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"; | Regular Season\n!colspan=12 ! style=\"\"; | \n!colspan=12 style=\";\" | \nStatistics.\nAs of March 14, 2023\nAwards and honors.\nHockey East All-Stars\nHockey East Rookie of the Month\nHockey East Player of the Week\nHockey East Rookie of the Week\nHockey East Goalie of the Week\nHockey East Defender of the Week"

Jones attended Lawrence North High School, where he played football, track-and-field, and basketball. After his successful tenure in high school, Jones was named an Associated Press all-state offensive lineman for the state of Indiana.\nCollege career.\nJones was rated as the twelfth-best player in the state of Indiana going into college and chose to attend Indiana University. Jones redshirted his freshman year and never played a down for Indiana. In his sophomore year, Jones started his first game against FIU and played in eleven games that year. Jones then started the most games in a season he ever would for Indiana, starting twelve games at right tackle and one game at left tackle. With the help of Jones' blocking, Indiana set a school record for the most amount of passing yards in a season. The next year, due to a shortened season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Jones only started five games for Indiana. In Jones' senior and final year, he started all twelve games for Indiana at right tackle.\nProfessional career.\nAfter going undrafted in the 2022 NFL Draft, Jones was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Green Bay Packers. Jones did not initially make the Packers' 53-man roster and was signed to the practice squad. However, due to a lack of depth at offensive line during the 2022 NFL season, Jones was signed from the practice squad to the Packers' roster. On October 1, 2022, Jones was placed on the non-football illness list, and later activated on December 14. After the 2023 season, he was offered a tender."

It was succeeded by the 1972 tour of New Zealand and Fiji, exactly five years. Unlike both teams' usual arrangement of playing a two- or three-match series, the 1967 tour was a one-off match, the first since Australia's 1931 tour and wouldn't be repeated again until New Zealand's 1979 tour of Australia.\nDespite the significant margin going the way of New Zealand, the half-time scoreline was 9–3 in New Zealand's favour with New Zealand scoring two penalty goals and one drop goal. While Australia had one try (unconverted) via Rod Batterham."

        "title": "2025 Rugby League World Cup",
        "text": "The 2025 Rugby League World Cup (RLWC2025) was a planned collection of world cups in the sport of rugby league which was replaced by the 2026 Rugby League World Cup.\nLike 2021, the 2025 World Cup was to have run the men's, women's and wheelchair world cups simultaneously, in addition to a youth World Cup.\nOriginally due to be staged in the USA and Canada, the offer was withdrawn due to financial concerns, hosting was subsequently awarded to France. In May 2023 the French organisers pulled out of hosting the games. On 3 August 2023 the tournaments were cancelled by the sport's governing body with the announcement that a new reduced-size tournament would take place in the southern hemisphere in 2026.\nHost selection.\nHost 1: United States and Canada.\nAfter the United States lost the 2021 Rugby League World Cup bid to England, International Rugby League (IRL) recommended that the United States and Canada should host the 2025 event after a bid by Moore Sports International. The IRL Congress reviewed that recommendation at a meeting in November 2016. \nOn 20 November, it was announced that the United States and Canada bid had won the rights to host the 2025 World Cup. This would have been the first time the tournament was held outside of Europe and Oceania.\nOn 4 December 2018, plans for the World Cup to be held in North America were scrapped due to financial concerns and that the location of the 2025 Rugby League World Cup would be determined by a new bidding process in 2019.\nHost 2: France.\nIn March 2021, it was reported that France is the preferred destination for the 2025 Rugby League World Cup. France officially lodged a bid later that year, in July.\nIn January 2022, France won the bid to host the world cup. The official announcement announcing France as the host nation was made on 11 January 2022 by then French prime minister, Jean Castex, who described hosting the tournament as \"a tremendous asset for economic appeal and social cohesion\".\nInternational Rugby League president Troy Grant stated:\nOn 12 May 2023 reports began circulating that France would withdraw from hosting the tournament.\nOn 15 May, it was announced that France had withdrawn as hosts, due to financial concerns from the new French government, elected in May 2022. French rugby league journalist cited the lack of regular international matches and France's poor performances in recent years as a contributing factor to the French Government's decision.\nControversy surrounding the withdrawal.\nFollowing the withdrawal of France as hosts, organisers and journalists began to criticise the French government on their decision as it was reported that that the French Government were demanding \"financial guarantee to cover the risk of losses\". Controversy comes from the planned investment of €10,000,000 being dwarfed compared to the money already invested by the French Government into the 2023 Rugby Union World Cup (~€170,000,000) and 2024 Summer Olympics (~€1,500,000,000). Other journalists have also likened the dissociation of rugby league by the French Government to the sport's ban under the Vichy France regime.\nReaction to the withdrawal.\nInternational Rugby League president Troy Grant statement on the withdrawal:\nGrant also expressed that France will continue to be \"central to our strategic plans\", whilst acknowledging that the 2025 tournament was an ambitious project from the start, but one believed possible after the success of the 2021 Rugby League World Cup.\nRodolphe Pires described the withdrawal as a \"betrayal\" to French rugby league fans.\nSam Tomkins, then captain of the largest club in France, Catalans Dragons, described the withdrawal as a \"huge blow\" to French rugby league and continued to say it was something that the French public \"were really looking forward to\".\nSubsequent action and cancellation.\nOne day after France's withdrawal, New Zealand announced it was considering a bid to host the tournament in 2026, as well as a bid with potential co-hosts Australia which could be staged in the intended 2025. Fiji, Qatar, and South Africa had also expressed interest.\nIn August 2023 the IRL announced that the 2025 tournaments were cancelled with the next events to take place in 2026 in the southern hemisphere and with the number of nations taking part in the men's tournament reduced from 16 to 10. The number of women's and wheelchair teams participating remained at 8 after a planned expansion to 16.\nNations.\nAt the time of cancellation, 17 nations had qualified for the four tournaments:\nNote: M=Men's tournament, W=Women's tournament, WC=Wheelchair tournament, Y=Youth tournament\nQualification.\nThe above nations had automatically qualified for the 2025 Rugby League World Cup by virtue of reaching the 2021 quarter finals (men's), participating in 2021 (women's and wheelchair), or by being one of the four core rugby league nations (youth).\nMen's.\nAmericas.\nBrazil won the 2022 South American Rugby League Championship. As a result they were to enter a 2023 qualification tournament with Canada, Jamaica, and the United States for the Americas' two places in the tournament.\nEurope.\nEuropean qualification was intended to be achieved via the 2023 Rugby League European Championships and following repêchage in 2024 for Europe's four remaining places.\nAfrica and Oceania.\nThe winner of a 2023 African qualification tournament (details of which were never announced) would play the Cook Islands in 2024 for the final place in the tournament.\nWomen's.\n2025 would have been the first time women's teams would have to qualify for the World Cup. However, a complete qualification schedule was never announced. It was intended that the qualification process would have been announced in June 2023. Including the automatically qualifying teams, the tournament would consist of three teams from The Americas, six from Asia-Pacific, six Europe, and one from Middle East-Africa. On 8 March 2023, details for the European qualification process were announced with eight teams divided into two groups and matches scheduled to take place between September 2023 and May 2024.\nWheelchair and Youth.\nThe wheelchair tournament would continue to be invitees only, with the inaugural youth tournament being the same.\nVenues.\nFor the tournament, 38 cities bid to host matches across the men's, women's, wheelchair, and youth competitions. These were:\nAlbi, Arras, Autun, Beauvais, Blagnac, Begles, Besancon, Biganos, Bordeaux, Boulazac, Carcassonne, Chambery, Chatillon, Issoire, Le Creusot, Le Mans, Libourne, Limoges, Limoux, Lourdes, Marmande-Tonneins, Martigues, Massy, Montauban, Montlucon; Narbonne, Nice, Paris, Perigueux, Perpignan, Pia, Roanne, Salon-de-Provence, Toulouse, Trelissac, Vannes, Vichy, Villefrance-de-Rouergue, Villeneuve-sur-Lot.\nIt was intended that Paris, Toulouse and Marseille would host the final and semi-finals of the men's tournament."
