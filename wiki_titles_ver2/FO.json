        "title": "Points system (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a points system is a method for determining the winner of a cricket series involving multiple formats of cricket matches. The method awards teams points for winning Test, One Day International and T20I matches, with the winner being determined by the team with the highest total score. The system was first introduced in women's cricket for the 2013 Women's Ashes series, and continues to be in use for the Women's Ashes. A multi-format points system was also used in men's cricket in 2016.\nWomen's cricket.\nA multi-format points system was first introduced for the 2013 Women's Ashes series in England; the series consisted of one Test match, three One Day Internationals and two Twenty20 Internationals. Six points were awarded for winning the Test match, with two points each if drawn, and two points for winning a limited overs match, and one point each if the match was drawn. Talking about the points system, then England captain Charlotte Edwards said \" It preserves Test cricket, which is the most important thing, but equally we get to play the more popular formats which are one day and Twenty20 which the media and the public has a huge demand for.\" England won the series 12–4 after the test match was drawn, Australia won one ODI and England won two ODIs and all three T20Is. The system was used again in the 2013–14 women's Ashes in Australia, with England winning 10–8, despite winning fewer matches; England won the test match, one ODI and one T20I, while Australia won two ODIs and two T20Is.\nFor the 2015 Women's Ashes series, the points system was changed, so that four points were awarded for a test match win, rather than six. Australian coach Matthew Mott described this updated system as fairer, as \"Whether you win or lose the Test match, it doesn't really disadvantage or advantage you.\" Australia won the series 10–6. The 2017–18 Women's Ashes was tied 8–8. Australia also won the 2019 Women's Ashes series 12–4.\nIn 2021, the points system was used for India's tour of England, the first time that it had been used in women's cricket outside of the Ashes. The points system was the same as the Women's Ashes, with four points for winning the Test match, two points if the Test is drawn, and two points for each win in the limited overs matches. England beat India 10–6 in the multi-format series. The same system was used for India's tour of Australia later in 2021; Australia won the series 11–5. The Test match was drawn, Australia won the WODI series 2–1. and the T20 series 2–0, The first WT20I finished with no result due to rain. The same points system was used in the 2022 series between England and South Africa. England won the series 14–2, after winning all the limited-overs matches; the Test match between the sides was drawn.\nMen's cricket.\nIn May 2016, it was confirmed that a multiformat points system would be used for England's summer series against Sri Lanka and Pakistan. The points system would be the same as the system used in the 2015 Women's Ashes series, with four points being awarded for winning a Test match, and two points being awarded for winning a One Day International or Twenty20 International. The winning team under the points system will be awarded £25,000. Director of England Cricket Andrew Strauss, who announced the new points system, said that \"We're trying to create more context to every game that's played.\" Sri Lankan captain Angelo Mathews was opposed to the points system, saying \"I don’t like to move away from the traditional game but whatever the administrators decide we’ll have to go with and move on\", whilst former England captain Michael Vaughan called the new system \"nonsense\". Former Australian bowler Jason Gillespie said that the points system was worth a trial, as it had been successful in The Women's Ashes. England won on points in both tours, 20–4 and 16–12. The points system has not been used again in men's international cricket."

In the bronze-medal match, the Czech Republic's Lucie Hradecká and Radek Štěpánek defeated India's Sania Mirza and Rohan Bopanna, 6–1, 7–5. The United States became the first nation to win two gold medals in the mixed doubles, and the Czech Republic won its first medal in the event.\nThe tournament was held at the Olympic Tennis Centre in the Barra Olympic Park in Barra da Tijuca in the west zone of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil from 10 to 14 August 2016. 30 players (15 pairs) from 12 nations competed (with one Spanish pair withdrawing).\nBackground.\nThis was the sixth appearance of mixed doubles tennis. The event was first held in 1900 and would not be held again until 1912 (when both outdoor and indoor versions were held); it would then be held the next two Games in 1920 and 1924. Tennis was not a medal sport from 1928 to 1984, though there were demonstration events in 1968 (which included mixed doubles) and 1984 (which did not). Mixed doubles did not return with the rest of the tennis programme in 1988; instead, it was not until 2012 that mixed doubles returned to the programme, where it has been since.\nVictoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi were the defending champions, but they were not able to defend their title as a result of Azarenka's withdrawal due to pregnancy. There was no clear favourite.\nRomania made its mixed doubles debut. France and Great Britain each competed for the fifth time, tied for most among nations.\nQualification.\nEntries for the 16-team mixed doubles event were determined on-site from those players already participating in singles or doubles, with a maximum of two teams per country. Teams had to be nominated by their National Olympic Committee by the deadline of 9 August.\nCompetition format.\nThe competition was a single-elimination tournament with a bronze-medal match. All matches were best-of-three sets. Tie-breaks were used for the first two sets of each match. If the score was tied at one set all, a 'super tie-break' (the first pairing to win at least 10 points by a margin of two points) would be used."

The Fred Carlson Company of Decorah, which supervised its construction, hired unemployed men from the area as laborers. The bathhouse \"is the only remaining building from WPA projects of its style and significance in Iowa.\" It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2012."

Reynolds played college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores, and the San Francisco Giants selected him with the 59th pick in the 2016 MLB draft. The Giants traded him to the Pirates in 2018. He made his MLB debut in 2019 and was an All-Star in 2021.\nEarly life and amateur career.\nBryan Patrick Reynolds was born on January 27, 1995, in Baltimore, Maryland. He attended Brentwood High School in Brentwood, Tennessee and Vanderbilt University, where he played college baseball for the Vanderbilt Commodores.\nAs a freshman at Vanderbilt in 2014, Reynolds played in 72 games and hit .338/.395/.480 with four home runs and 54 runs batted in (RBIs), helping Vanderbilt win the College World Series championship.

He signed and was assigned to the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes, where he made his professional debut. He was later promoted to the Augusta GreenJackets. In 56 total games between Salem-Keizer and Augusta, Reynolds batted .313 with six home runs, 38 RBIs, and an .847 OPS. He spent 2017 with the San Jose Giants where he posted a .312 batting average with ten home runs and 63 RBIs in 121 games. He participated in the 2017 All-Star Futures Game.\nOn January 15, 2018, the Giants traded Reynolds, Kyle Crick, and $500,000 of international bonus slot money to the Pittsburgh Pirates in exchange for Andrew McCutchen and cash considerations. MLB.com ranked Reynolds as Pittsburgh's sixth best prospect going into the 2018 season. Reynolds began 2018 with the Pirates Double-A team the Altoona Curve. He was placed on the disabled list retroactive to April 9, underwent hand surgery in mid-April, and was activated on May 29. Reynolds played in 88 games for the Curve driving in 46 runs along with a .302 batting average. In 2019 he started the season with the Pirates Triple-A team the Indianapolis Indians.\nPittsburgh Pirates (2019–present).\nOn April 20, 2019, the Pirates promoted Reynolds to the major leagues.

He finished the season fourth in National League Rookie of the Year voting, playing in 134 games.\nIn the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, Reynolds hit .189/.275/.357 with seven home runs and 19 RBIs in 55 games. His performance improved significantly the following season: he was one of two Pirates, along with Adam Frazier to play in the 2021 All-Star Game, where he started in center field and batted eighth. He finished the 2021 season hitting .302/.390/.522 with 24 home runs and 90 RBIs.

After a slow start to the season, Reynolds finished 2022 hitting .262/.345/.461 with 62 RBIs, and a career high 27 home runs. \nOn April 25, 2023, Reynolds and the Pirates reached an agreement on an 8-year contract worth $106.75 million. The contract broke the record for both the largest in Pirates history, as well as the largest for any MLB player outfielder who was drafted out of college.\nPersonal life.\nReynolds is a Christian. Reynolds and his wife, Blair, had their first child, a son, in August 2020. They reside in the Nashville area."

It determined the national champion for the 2016–17 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. The game was played on April 3, 2017, at University of Phoenix Stadium, now known as State Farm Stadium, in Glendale, Arizona between the Gonzaga Bulldogs and the North Carolina Tar Heels. North Carolina defeated Gonzaga, 71–65, to win its sixth men's basketball national championship.\nThis was the first national championship game to be played in a state in either the Mountain or Pacific time zones since the 1995 game, which was held at the Kingdome in Seattle, Washington. North Carolina was playing in its second consecutive title game (and eleventh overall), after losing to Villanova at the buzzer the previous year. Meanwhile, Gonzaga was playing in its first-ever title game. It was the second national title game in three years – and the eighth overall – to be played between two No. 1 seeds.\nBackground.\nGonzaga Bulldogs.\nIn his seventeenth year at the helm, Gonzaga head coach Mark Few led the team to its first Final Four and national championship game in school history, following a sweet sixteen appearance the year before. The team opened the season winning their first two games prior to competing in the AdvoCare Invitational. The Bulldogs beat Quinnipiac and Florida in order to reach the championship game versus Iowa State. The Bulldogs jumped out to an early lead and held it through half time, reaching eighteen points in the second-half. However, with four minutes to go the Cyclones rallied to cut the Bulldogs' lead to one at 70–69. Gonzaga won the game 7271 as Iowa State missed a potential three-point shot as time expired to leave. This was their third time winning the event after previously doing so in 2008 and 2012. Following their defeat of South Dakota, Gonzaga entered their conference season with an undefeated record and broke the school record for most consecutive wins to start a season with twelve.\nAfter a 29–1 regular season and winning the 2017 West Coast Conference regular season championship, Gonzaga beat Pacific and Santa Clara en route to the 2017 West Coast Conference tournament finals, where they defeated Saint Mary's. The Bulldogs were the #1 seed in the West Regional of the 2017 NCAA Tournament.\nIn the first round of the tournament, after a tightly contested first half against South Dakota State, Jordan Mathews' 16 points and Przemek Karnowski's three consecutive baskets built a 20-point lead with 5 minutes left, helping Gonzaga to come away with a 66–46 win. In the second-round game against Northwestern, Wildcat head coach Chris Collins, trailing by five with five minutes left – after trailing by as many as 22 in the second half – stomped onto the court when a goal-tending call was missed. Collins subsequently drew a technical foul, thereby dooming Northwestern's chances of winning the game, as Gonzaga would prevail to win 79–73.\nIn Gonzaga's Sweet 16 game against West Virginia, Mathews hit a go-ahead three-pointer with less than a minute remaining to give Gonzaga a 60–58 lead. Gonzaga won the game 61–58 and advanced to the Elite Eight. In the Elite Eight, led by Nigel Williams-Goss' 23-point performance, Gonzaga routed Xavier 83–59 to reach the Final Four for the first time in school history.\nGonzaga defeated South Carolina 77–73 in the Final Four led by 23 points from Williams-Goss and 27 points from Gonzaga's big men. A Josh Perkins foul preventing Sindarius Thornwell's game-tying three-pointer with 3.5 seconds left enabled the Bulldogs to advance to the championship game.\nNorth Carolina Tar Heels.\nAfter a 26–6 regular season, North Carolina beat Miami (FL) in the ACC tournament before losing to Duke in the semifinals. Despite the loss, North Carolina was selected as the top seed in the South regional as an at-large.\nIn the first round of the tournament, Justin Jackson broke out of a shooting slump and led North Carolina with 21 points to a 103–64 win over Texas Southern. In the second round against Arkansas, after blowing a 17-point first half lead and trailing 65–60 with under three minutes remaining, Kennedy Meeks led a North Carolina comeback with 16 points and a huge tip-in with 44.2 seconds remaining to put UNC ahead 68–65 as they survived to win 72–65, and advance to the Sweet 16.\nIn the Sweet 16, Joel Berry II and Jackson led North Carolina to a 92–80 win over Butler with 26 and 24 points, respectively, to advance to the Elite Eight for the 26th time in program history. In an Elite Eight showdown between two college basketball blue bloods, North Carolina beat Kentucky 75–73 on a jump shot by Luke Maye with 0.3 seconds left, advancing to its second consecutive appearance – and record-setting 20th overall appearance – in the Final Four. Maye's shot is additionally remarkable for its similarities to Duke player Christian Laettner's shot against Kentucky in the 1992 Elite Eight 25 years earlier. Both Maye and Laettner wore the number 32; both games involved a No. 1 seed blue-wearing team from North Carolina playing against No. 2 seed Kentucky in the Elite Eight; and both scored a long two-pointer at or near the buzzer to win the game. Laettner himself noted the similarities in a tweet.\nNext, North Carolina defeated Oregon 77–76 in the Final Four to advance to the championship game. Meeks led the Tar Heels with a double-double – a career-high 25 points and 14 rebounds – including an important offensive rebound of a Berry missed free throw with 4.0 seconds left to clinch the victory.\nMedia coverage.\nThe game was televised in the United States by CBS. ESPN International had the media rights outside of the United States.\nRadio coverage in the United States was provided by Westwood One.\nGame summary.\nGonzaga led North Carolina at the half, 35–32. North Carolina outscored Gonzaga in the second half, 39–30, to win the championship. Gonzaga was up two points with 1:52 remaining, but North Carolina came back and clinched the victory in the closing minutes.\nNorth Carolina won despite a poor (4-for-27) conversion rate of 3-point shots, and the Tar Heels made more points from free-throw conversions (15-for-26). The game included a total of 44 fouls. Overall, there were 26 free-throws for each side, leading the \"Associated Press\" report to deride the game as merely a free-throw contest.\nCriticism.\nIn contrast to the positive reaction to the previous year's title game—in which UNC lost to Villanova at the buzzer—many criticized the quality of play in the 2017 championship. North Carolina head coach Roy Williams did so as well, commenting during the trophy presentation ceremony that \"neither team played very well.\"\nThe media generally blamed officiating for the game's low quality. Both teams were in the bonus eight minutes into the second half. The \"Associated Press\" labeled the game \"unwatchable.\" Mark Tracy of the \"New York Times\" declared it a \"sluggish slog of a national title game.\" Myron Medcalf, writing for \"ESPN\", wrote that the game was blighted with \"an abundance of foul calls, poor offense and a sleep-inducing rhythm.\" Chris Chase of \"Fox Sports\" lamented how the referees had \"ruined\" the contest through a combination of incorrect foul calls, missed calls, and superfluous use of instant replay. Tom Ley of \"Deadspin\" condemned the game as \"memorably disgusting.\"\nMultiple prominent current and former basketball players vocalized their distaste for the game's quality of officiating on social media, including LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, James Worthy, and Jay Williams."

Williams lost just one set during the tournament, to Christina McHale in the second round.\nThis was also the first time two women contested multiple major finals in the same season since Amélie Mauresmo and Justine Henin-Hardenne met in the 2006 Australian Open and Wimbledon finals, as Williams and Kerber had contested the 2016 Australian Open final.\nThis marked the first Wimbledon where no two fellow countrywomen faced off in the first round, meaning no country was guaranteed to have a player in the second round.\nIn addition to Williams and Kerber, Garbiñe Muguruza, Agnieszka Radwańska and Simona Halep were in contention for the world No. 1 ranking. Williams retained the top spot by reaching the fourth round. She also spent her 300th week atop the WTA rankings during the second week of the tournament, and won her 300th major match by defeating Annika Beck in the third round.\nAt 36 years old, Venus Williams became the oldest woman to reach a major semifinal since Martina Navratilova at the 1994 Wimbledon Championships."

        "text": "The Chess World Cup 2017 was a 128-player single-elimination chess tournament, held in Tbilisi, Georgia, from 2 to 27 September 2017. It was won by Armenian grandmaster Levon Aronian. This was the second time he had won the Chess World Cup, 12 years after his first win in 2005. It was the 7th edition of the Chess World Cup.\nThe top two finishers in the tournament, Aronian and Ding Liren, qualified for the Candidates Tournament 2018 for the World Chess Championship 2018.\nBidding process.\nAt the 85th FIDE Congress held during the 41st Chess Olympiad, FIDE received bids to host the World Cup 2017 and 2018 Olympiad from the national federations of Georgia and South Africa. South Africa proposed Sun City and Durban as venues, while Georgia proposed Tbilisi and Batumi respectively. Although Garry Kasparov expressed support for the South African bid during his FIDE presidential campaign, Georgia's bid won, receiving 93 votes to South Africa's 58.\nFormat.\nThe tournament was a knock-out format, with the exception that there was a provision for the two semi-final losers to play off for third place if necessary (see #Candidates qualification).\nMatches consist of two regular time limit games (except for the final, and playoff for third if required, which consist of four regular time limit games). For these two games, players have 90 minutes for the first 40 moves followed by 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an increment of 30 seconds per move from the start of the game.\nIf a match is tied after the regular games, tie breaks will be played the next day. The format for the tie breaks is as follows:\nCandidates qualification.\nThe tournament qualified two players for the 2018 Candidates Tournament.\nHowever Magnus Carlsen (world champion) and Sergey Karjakin (already seeded to the Candidates) had no need for qualification, and both participated in the tournament (even though it is highly unusual for the defending champion to do so). So the rules were actually that the top two finishers other than Carlsen and Karjakin would qualify for the Candidates. This meant there was provision for a match for third place, between the two semi-final losers, if necessary.\nAs it turned out, both Carlsen and Karjakin were eliminated in the first three rounds, so the two Candidates qualifiers were simply the two finalists: Armenia's Levon Aronian and China's Ding Liren.\nSchedule.\nEach of the first six rounds takes three days: one day each for the two regular time limit games, then a third day for tie breaks, if required. The final round has four days of regular time limit games, then a fifth day for tie breaks, if required.\nAll rounds begin at 15:00 local time (11:00 UTC).\nPrize money.\nAccording to the regulations, all players have to pay their own expenses for travel, and 20% of each player's prize money goes to FIDE.\nParticipants.\nThe participants are seeded by their FIDE rating of August 2017. All players are grandmasters unless indicated otherwise.\nDress code controversy.\nShortly before the third-round game between Anton Kovalyov and Maxim Rodshtein was due to start, Kovalyov was questioned by the arbiter about the knee-length Bermuda shorts he was wearing, the same pair he wore in the first two rounds. Tournament organizer Zurab Azmaiparashvili then approached Kovalyov, stating that his attire violated the FIDE dress code and that he would be punished financially if he did not change what he was wearing. Kovalyov explained that he also wore shorts in the 2015 World Cup without incident, but Azmaiparashvili objected and said that Kovalyov's clothing made him \"look like a gypsy.\" Kovalyov interpreted this as a racial slur. Kovalyov then left the tournament hall and did not return, thus forfeiting the game. He also checked out of his hotel and booked a flight for Dallas, where he is studying for a master's degree in Computer Science technology at the University of Texas. The Chess Federation of Canada filed a formal complaint about the incident. FIDE issued a report on the incident on October 1."

        "text": "The 2017 FIA World Endurance Championship was the sixth season of the FIA World Endurance Championship, an auto racing series co-organised by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the Automobile Club de l'Ouest (ACO). The series is open to Le Mans Prototypes and grand tourer-style racing cars divided into four categories. The season began at the Silverstone Circuit in April and will end at the Bahrain International Circuit in November, and include the 85th running of the 24 Hours of Le Mans. World championship titles will be awarded to the leading prototype drivers and manufacturers, while for the first time in the World Endurance Championship the leading grand touring drivers and manufacturers will also be awarded a world championship.\nFollowing the 6 Hours of Fuji, the #2 Porsche drivers Timo Bernhard, Earl Bamber, and Brendon Hartley currently lead the World Endurance Drivers' Championship, the #38 Jackie Chan DC Racing crew of Ho-Pin Tung, Oliver Jarvis and Thomas Laurent lead the Endurance Trophies for LMP2 Drivers and Teams, the #51 AF Corse duo James Calado and Alessandro Pier Guidi lead the GT World Endurance Drivers' and Teams Championships, and the Proton Competition crew of Christian Ried, Marvin Dienst and Matteo Cairoli lead the Endurance Trophy for GTE-Am Drivers. The #61 Clearwater Racing entry leads the Endurance Trophy for GTE-Am Teams. Porsche lead the World Endurance Manufacturers' Championship, while Ferrari leads the GT World Endurance Manufacturers' Championship.\nSchedule.\nThe ACO announced a provisional calendar on 22 September 2016, largely identical to the 2016 schedule. For the upcoming season, the 6 Hours of Nürburgring event is moved one week earlier in the year, in order to avoid a potential clash with the German Grand Prix. At the same time, for the first time in the history of the WEC, the official pre-season test will not be held at Circuit Paul Ricard in France, and will instead be held at the Autodromo Nazionale Monza in Italy.\nTeams and drivers.\nOn 26 October 2016, Audi Sport Team Joest announced its withdrawal from the World Endurance Championship (WEC) at the end of the season. \nLMP2.\nIn accordance with the new Le Mans Prototype LMP2 regulations for 2017, all cars utilise the Gibson GK428 4.2 L V8 engine.\nRegulation changes.\nAs part of the ACO's 2017 regulations, the LMP2 category has been revamped with the introduction of a single specification motor from Gibson Technology, with increased power output compared to 2016 LMP2s. Cockpit and chassis designs will also mimic the LMP1 regulations for safety. The four approved chassis manufacturers were Dallara, Ligier, Oreca and Riley. Due to the single engine manufacturer, LMP2 teams are allowed an unlimited number of engines during the season.\nAt the behest of the manufacturers in LMGTE, the World Motor Sport Council approved the promotion of the GT Manufacturers' and Drivers' World Cups to world championship status, on par with the Manufacturers' and Drivers' World Championships for the LMP categories. LMGTE teams will also be limited to only three tyre compounds over the season, although the third compound does not have to be chosen until Le Mans. However, teams in LMGTE Pro as well as LMP1, will be limited to four sets of tyres plus two spares at all six-hour races. LMGTE entries will also no longer incur a penalty for changing an engine between qualifying and the race.\nAcross all categories, limitations on testing have been decreased in an attempt to lower costs. Wind tunnel testing has also been further restricted.\nResults and standings.\nRace results.\nThe highest finishing competitor entered in the World Endurance Championship is listed below. Invitational entries may have finished ahead of WEC competitors in individual races.\nEntries were required to complete the timed race as well as to complete 70% of the overall winning car's race distance in order to earn championship points. A single bonus point was awarded to the team and all drivers of the pole position car for each category in qualifying. For the 24 Hours of Le Mans, the race result points allocation was doubled. Furthermore, a race must complete three laps under green flag conditions in order for championship points to be awarded.\nDriver championships.\nFour titles are offered to drivers, two with world championship status. The World Endurance Drivers' Championship is reserved for LMP1 and LMP2 drivers while the GT World Endurance Drivers' Championship is available for drivers in the LMGTE categories. An FIA Endurance Trophy is awarded in the LMP2 and in LMGTE Am. The FIA Endurance Trophy for LMP1 Private Teams Drivers was not rewarded in 2017 due to not meeting the minimum number of entrants.\nManufacturer championships.\nTwo manufacturers' titles will be contested, one for LMP1s and one for LMGTEs. The World Endurance Manufacturers' Championship is only open to manufacturer entries in the LMP1 category, while the GT World Endurance Manufacturers' Championship allows all entries from registered manufacturers in LMGTE Pro and LMGTE Am to participate. The top two finishing cars from each manufacturer earn points toward their total.\nTeam championships.\nAn FIA Endurance Trophy is awarded in the LMP2, LMGTE Pro, and LMGTE Am categories. A trophy for the private LMP1 teams is not awarded in 2017 due to not meeting the minimum number of entrants."

        "text": "The Iran national ice hockey team () is the national men's ice hockey team of Iran. The team was founded in June 2016, is controlled by the Islamic Republic of Iran Skating Federation, and on 26 September 2019, became an associate member of the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF). Iran made its debut in the IIHF World Championship in 2022. As of 2022, Iran is ranked 56th in the IIHF World Ranking.\nHistory.\nIce hockey in Iran.\nBack in the 1970s, ice hockey was played as a recreation sport by the general public at the \"Ice Palace\" () which was located in Pahlavi Street before Vanak Square, there was also another ice rink located in Aryamehr Sport Complex which was only used for ice skating. As a result of Iranian Revolution, ice hockey and skating became banned, hence ice rinks got closed down. Today, hockey is an exclusively all-male sport in Iran.\nFarzad Houshidari was among the first Iranians who played ice hockey abroad, and helped start ice hockey in Iran. Daniel Rahimi, Mika Zibanejad and Rhett Rakhshani, who all have Iranian heritage, were selected in the NHL Entry Draft, with Zibanejad and Rakhshani playing in the NHL. Both Rahimi and Zibanejad represented Sweden in international competitions while Rakhshani represented the United States. Currently there are two players of Iranian-origin in Oman, Mustafa Hamedi and Ali Reza Rasoli. Umut Taherzadeh have represented Turkey internationally. Other notable players are Mark Ardelan, Ryan Mior, Farzad Khojasteh and Arian Ali-Zade.\nThere are currently four Ice Rinks which are Aramis Sports Complex (Tehran), Damoon Shopping Center (Kish Island) and Padide Shandiz Shopping Center (Mashhad), which were respectively opened in 2013, 2014 and 2015. There is a standard Ice Rink called Ice Box, located in Iran Mall, Tehran, that was opened in 2019. Slashing, spearing, and stabbing are not penalized in Iranian hockey.\nIn July 2015, Taylan Aytac from Turkey, taught in Iran's first ice hockey workshop which was held in Aramis Sports Complex in Tehran, which was also attended by Iranian trainee-instructors Pooya Ghandali and Saman Goodarzi.\nOn 1 October 2016, the first ice hockey match was played between two Iranian club teams in a friendly in Padide Ice Rink in Mashhad, Padide defeated Khorasan Razavi 5–4. Both teams have been training twice a day since September 2016.\nNational team.\nAs of 2015, Iran decided to form a national ice hockey team with the intention of participating at the 2017 Asian Winter Games. A team was formed in the first quarter of 2016 after Iran made a campaign of recruiting players of Iranian heritage who live abroad. In order to fast track the creation of a national team, the coaching staff decided that it would be best to select players from the Iranian inline hockey national team powered by hockey players of Iranian-origin from abroad. In 2016, three national camps were held, 26–28 June in Asiago (Italy), 20–27 August in Almaty (Kazakhstan) and 21–24 December in Dubai (United Arab Emirates). In each camp players were coached by three different instructors, Christian Müller from Germany, Former head coach of Kyrgyzstan and Yenbek Almaty, Sergei Shavernev from Kazakhstan, and at the time professional player &amp; head coach of Dubai White Bears IIHF and 2x NCAA Men’s Ice Hockey Champion UMICH '98 UMAINE '99 Troy Kahler from Toronto, Canada.\nOn 23 August 2016, Iran national team played its first match against a non-Iranian team. Iran won 5–4 over Kazakh team HC Almaty in the city of Almaty in Kazakhstan.\nIran was supposed to participate at the 2017 Asian Winter Games, but was disqualified after a number of Iranian players were deemed ineligible to compete in the regional games. Reported concerns leading to the disqualification includes some players failing to reside in Iran for at least three years despite having Iranian heritage, and claims of some players having represented other countries. Games were supposed to be the team's first tournament.\nThe Olympic Council of Asia allowed Iran to play its scheduled games at the Asian Winter Games but the matches were considered exhibition games and results did not count in the competition standings. Iran's first official match against other national team was a 7–1 loss to Macau in Sapporo, Japan. The game was supposed to be Iran's first match at the Asian Winter Games if they were not disqualified. They won 10–3 in their second exhibition game against Indonesia."

For 21 years, Crowe coached both the men's and women's programs at Dartmouth.\nCareer.\nGeorge Crowe began his coaching career at the Albany Academy for Boys before moving into the college level to take over for the newly minted club team at Oswego State in 1964. The Great Lakers became a Division III in 1966, and while they had success early on, Crowe left the program after only three more years. He returned to coach high school hockey, this time at Phillips Exeter Academy. Six years on Crowe accepted a second coaching gig in the NCAA, this time with Dartmouth.\nWhen Crowe arrived in Hanover, the Big Green hadn't made a tournament appearance in 26 years and had 15 losing seasons in that span. Crowe's arrival brought about immediate dividends when Dartmouth won 11 more games than the previous season and, after two middling years, the Big Green posted back-to-back 19-win seasons, making the tournament in both 1979 and 1980 (The team's last appearance as of 2016). Unfortunately, Dartmouth began losing soon thereafter once more ending up with sub-.500 records in each of the next four seasons, bottoming out with a 3-23 mark in 1983–84 (a team-worst record to that point). After the season, Crowe resigned to spend more time with his Elite Sports Camps.\nAfter going through 3 separate head coaches over the previous three seasons, the women's team at Dartmouth was looking for yet another bench boss and turned to Crowe to stabilize the program. The choice was soon proven to be a correct one as Crowe led the Big Green to winning seasons in each of the twelve years with the women's team. In that time, Dartmouth won four Ivy League titles and became a perennial power. Crowe retired from coaching for good following the 1997–98 season, turning the team over to Judy Oberting\nHe died on January 6, 2019, at the age of 82."

        "text": "The final of the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy was played on 18 June 2017 between Pakistan and India at The Oval in London, to determine the winner of the eighth edition of the ICC Champions Trophy. Pakistan qualified for the final by defeating the hosts England convincingly by 8 wickets in the first semi-final at Cardiff in Wales on 14 June, and reached their maiden Champions Trophy final. India, the defending champions, came into the final by defeating Bangladesh with ease by 9 wickets in the second semi-final at Birmingham on 15 June, to reach their fourth Champions Trophy final, a record.\nPakistan won by 180 runs, which was the largest margin of victory in the final of an ICC ODI tournament. Pakistan, who were underdogs entering as the lowest-ranked team in the competition, became the seventh nation to win the Champions Trophy, and it was their first ICC ODI tournament title since the 1992 World Cup, as well as their latest ICC title in any format since the 2009 World Twenty20. Fakhar Zaman of Pakistan received the Man of the Match award for scoring 114. Shikhar Dhawan of India received the Golden Bat award for scoring 338 runs in the tournament while Hasan Ali of Pakistan received the Golden Ball award for taking 13 wickets; he was also adjudged the Man of the Series.\nThe match is estimated to have been watched by 400 million viewers, becoming the third most-watched game in cricketing history.\nBackground.\nPakistan and India share a historical rivalry in cricket. Prior to this match, the two sides had played 128 times against each other in ODIs, where Pakistan won 72 matches, India won 52 matches and four matches ended with no result. While Pakistan have had the upper hand bilaterally, India enjoyed an edge in global ICC tournaments where they won 13 times against Pakistan, and Pakistan won twice against India. The two sides met only twice before in the finals of global tournaments: the non-ICC World Championship of Cricket Final in 1985 and the 2007 ICC World Twenty20 Final, both won by India.\nPrior to this match, the teams had met four times in the Champions Trophy and had two victories each. Pakistan's last win was in 2009; since then, India won seven games against Pakistan across all ICC tournaments consecutively although India lost the home series in 2012 Their most recent clash was on 4 June 2017, during the group stages of the ongoing Champions Trophy where India won by 124 runs (D/L method). Much of the pre-match analysis envisioned a strong contest between India's batting lineup and Pakistan's bowling side, both of which were considered the strengths of their respective teams and remained formidable in this tournament.\nRoad to the final.\nPakistan.\nRanked eighth in the ICC ODI Championship at the start of the tournament, Pakistan started poorly, before improving progressively in each game. They lost to India in the first game by 124 runs in a sloppy display, but then defeated top-ranked South Africa by 19 runs by virtue of Duckworth–Lewis method in their next game. They gained momentum and beat Sri Lanka by 3 wickets in their final group game, a thrilling must-win encounter, and qualified for the semi-finals placed second in Group B, behind India on net run rate. In the semi-final, England with their undefeated run and home advantage were tipped firm favourites. However, they were outplayed by Pakistan with both bat and ball, the latter winning comprehensively by 8 wickets with almost 13 overs to spare. This paved the road for Pakistan's first qualification to a Champions Trophy final.\nIndia.\nIndia came into the tournament as defending champions and favourites along with England, and were ranked third in the ICC ODI Championship. They beat arch-rivals Pakistan convincingly in their first group face-off, winning by 124 runs. They lost their second match to Sri Lanka by 7 wickets, despite posting a total of 321, in what turned out to be the highest successful run-chase in Champions Trophy history. India won their final group game, a must-win encounter against South Africa, comfortably by 8 wickets. They finished on top of Group B with two wins and a net run rate ahead of Pakistan. In the semi-final, India faced Bangladesh, and put in yet another dominating display, winning comfortably by 9 wickets and sealing a final with Pakistan.\nMatch officials.\nMarais Erasmus of South Africa and Richard Kettleborough of England were named as the on-field umpires for the final. They had both previously officiated in the semi-final matches of the tournament; Erasmus, in the England–Pakistan match, and Kettleborough, in the Bangladesh–India match. Rod Tucker of Australia and Kumar Dharmasena of Sri Lanka, who also officiated in the semi-finals as on-field umpires, were appointed as the TV umpire and reserve umpire respectively. David Boon of Australia was the match referee, completing the five-member match official team.\nMatch summary.\nIndia remained unchanged from the side that played the semi-final, while Pakistan brought back their leading pacer Mohammad Amir, who was ruled out of the semi-final against England due to back spasm and replaced Rumman Raees. Indian captain Virat Kohli won the toss and elected his side to field first, sending Pakistan in to bat.\nPakistani innings.\nThe Pakistani opening pair, Azhar Ali and Fakhar Zaman, put on 128 runs before Ali was run out for 59 runs off the last ball of the 22nd over. Zaman, who seemed to have been out for 3 runs, only for a no-ball by Jasprit Bumrah to save him, continued on his way to a 92-ball century – his first at ODI level – eventually falling to Hardik Pandya on the first ball of the 33rd over. He made 114 runs from 106 balls, which included twelve fours and three sixes. After his dismissal, the other Pakistani batsmen kept the score ticking over. Mohammad Hafeez plundered 57 not out from 37 balls, including four fours and three sixes. Pakistan eventually finished on 338/4 – their second-highest ODI score against India – after 50 overs. Bhuvneshwar Kumar was the pick of the Indian bowlers, finishing with 1/44 from 10 overs (including two maidens).\nIndian innings.\nIndia started poorly, losing two early wickets to Mohammad Amir. Off the third ball of the game, Rohit Sharma was out leg before wicket for a three-ball duck. In the third over, Virat Kohli was dropped in the slips for just five runs but caught the next ball by Shadab Khan at point. Their poor form continued until, in the middle of the innings, Hardik Pandya and Ravindra Jadeja managed a rapid 80-run partnership prior to Pandya being run-out. However this was India's only batting highlight as the tail was quickly dismissed and India were all out after 30.3 overs, not even managing half of Pakistan's total.\nScorecard.\nFall of wickets: 1–128 (Azhar Ali, 22.6 ov), 2–200 (Fakhar Zaman, 33.1 ov), 3–247 (Shoaib Malik, 39.4 ov), 4–267 (Babar Azam, 42.3 ov)\nFall of wickets: 1–0 (Sharma, 0.3 ov), 2–6 (Kohli, 2.4 ov), 3–33 (Dhawan, 8.6 ov), 4–54 (Yuvraj Singh, 12.6 ov), 5–54 (Dhoni, 13.3 ov), 6–72 (Jadhav, 16.6 ov), 7–152 (Pandya, 26.3 ov), 8–156 (Jadeja, 27.3 ov), 9–156 (Ashwin, 28.1 ov), 10–158 (Bumrah, 30.3 ov)\nMatch officials\nKey\nAftermatch.\nThe Pakistani team were greeted with a heroic welcome by fans upon their return home. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif posted a congratulatory message on social media, and announced a cash reward of for each player. A ceremony was held for the players at the Prime Minister's Secretariat on 4 July. The property developer Bahria Town presented a sum of for every player, and awarded a one kanal plot to Fakhar Zaman for his performance.\nIn India, the loss was met with agitation by several fans. However, many Indians also commended Pakistan's performance and expressed solidarity with the Indian team regardless of the result. In Kashmir, widespread pro-Pakistan celebrations were reported amongst locals. Twenty-one Indian men who were allegedly celebrating Pakistan's victory were charged under India's sedition laws, and remanded in custody. The charges were dropped a few days later after the complainants accused the police of filing a \"false case\".\nTwo days after the match, India coach Anil Kumble stepped down from his position, amid reports of a rift between him and some of the players including captain Virat Kohli.\nPakistan's ICC team ranking for ODIs improved from eighth to sixth position, jumping ahead of Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.

        "title": "William J. Devine Memorial Golf Course",
        "text": "William J. Devine Memorial Golf Course, colloquially referred to as and contained within Franklin Park, is a municipal golf course in the Jamaica Plain neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, bordered by the neighborhoods of Dorchester and Roxbury. Established on October 26, 1896, it is the second oldest public golf course in the United States. The course is named after William J. Devine, former Commissioner of Boston's Parks and Recreation Department.\nHistory.\nIn 1890 George Wright, the former star shortstop of the Cincinnati Red Stockings and the Boston Red Stockings, set in motion the origin of the first public golf course in New England.\nWright and partner Henry Ditson were the proprietors of sporting goods store \"Wright &amp; Ditson\" on Washington Street in Boston. When ordering cricket equipment from an English athletic goods catalog, Wright noticed a listing for golf balls and clubs. Despite not having knowledge of the game, Wright placed an order for a dozen golf balls and a set of clubs.\nAfter acquiring a rulebook he attempted to play a game in Franklin Park in October 1890, but was stopped by a policeman who informed him he needed approval to play from the Boston Parks Department. Wright wrote a letter to the commission but was denied authorization, the stated concern that it was too dangerous for people walking in the park. Undeterred, Wright personally attended the next commissioners' meeting on December 5 and received a hearing, and a permit was granted on an \"experimental\" basis.\nOn December 10, Wright and an assistant paced off the holes, tomato cans buried in the ground serving as cups. Flagsticks were cut 3 feet in length with a piece of red flannel attached to serve as flags marking each hole. Wright, Fred Mansfield, Sam Macdonald and Temple Craig then played the new course, becoming the first foursome to play on American public, municipally-owned land. They played 2 rounds of 10 holes.\nAfter the day's events, Wright reported all had \"enjoyed the outing\" and the game was \"a grand success\". However, while private clubs were being established in Massachusetts after Wright's \"experiment\", no further golf was played at Franklin Park or any other public course in America through 1894.\nBoston resident Willie Campbell, the Scotland-born professional at Brookline's The Country Club began petitioning the City of Boston to open a public links at Franklin Park. Because of these efforts, a 9-hole municipal course designed by Campbell opened at the park on October 26, 1896. The course was built on \"Country Park\", a mile long and ¾ of a mile wide section, originally designed by Frederick Law Olmsted for the enjoyment of rural landscape for urban Bostonians. The cost of play was 25¢ for a double round of 9 holes, and the hours of operation were 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. daily, except for Sundays. The holes were named \"Harvard\", \"Valley Gate\", \"Schoolmaster\", \"Pettigrew\", \"Scarborough\", \"Canterbury\", \"Abbotts\", \"Brooks\" and \"Misery\". Campbell was named the first professional at the course.\nThe course was redesigned and expanded to 18 holes by Donald Ross in 1922. In recent years, course renovations have been done by Mark Mungeam of Mungeam Cornish Golf Design.\nThe first clubhouse was built in 1911. The building was destroyed during World War II when the hilltop was used for artillery guns. The second course clubhouse was built in 1949. Burned down in a suspicious fire in 1975, the building was subsequently reconstructed within the burned out shell of the old building in order to save money. This led to an unsatisfactory result, and the current clubhouse is the product of an entirely new design. It was built by the City of Boston for $3.4 million and was opened in 1998.\nLocation.\nFranklin Park links the neighborhoods of Jamaica Plain, Roxbury and Dorchester together due to its proximity to all three communities.

        "text": "Professional boxing in New Zealand refers to the sport of boxing held in New Zealand at a professional level.\nGoverning body.\nNew Zealand National Boxing Federation (NZNBF) and New Zealand Professional Boxing Association (NZPBA) are the national sporting commissioning bodies that run professional boxing in New Zealand. Other boxing bodies in New Zealand have been inactive including Boxing NZ Inc and New Zealand Boxing Council (NZBC). Boxing NZ Inc currently only commission amateur boxing events and NZBC has been inactive since 2007. The New Zealand Boxing Association (NZBA) was the first boxing commission in New Zealand, which began before 1900. In 1903, the NZBA was granted a special dispensation by the ruling world amateur body to conduct professional boxing. Thus was born the amateur undercard with pro bouts as the main card. In 2016, a New Boxing commission started called the Professional Boxing Commission New Zealand (PBCNZ). The PBCNZ commissioned their first show on Joseph Parker vs. Andy Ruiz. A small commissioning body called Pro-Box NZ (established in 2012), is semi active in New Zealand, however only does an average of three events per year. Most of Pro-Box NZ commissioned events are in the Bay of Plenty and Waikato area. In 2019, NZPBA was no longer considered the main professional boxing body as Pro Box NZ did more shows nationwide the NZPBA. PBCNZ was the main body for Auckland.\nHistory.\nIn 1903 Parliament formed and passed the Boxing and Wrestling Act to cover the facets and the issuing of a Police boxing permit. The act and regulations have been slightly amended over the years. The latest amendment was 1984, because only boxing and wrestling is named in the current act and regulations, is why all the other combat sports do not have to apply for Police permits or restricted by anything else such that is required for current day boxers.\nPacific Titles.\nIn 2018, Pro Box NZ created a new title for the pacific region called the Pro Box Pacific title, with the first bout happening on 4 May 2018 with Bowyn Morgan taking on Andres Delfin Rodriguez. PBCNZ tried to replicate the idea, however the original bout scheduled on 19 May 2018, between Sam Rapira and Abhay Chand did not happen due to Abhay Chand pulling out. Sam Rapira ended up fighting Ratu Dawai instead for the PBCNZ National Titles.\nProvincial titles.\nIn 2018, New Zealand Professional Boxing Association created three Provincial titles for New Zealand. The NZPBA Northern, NZPBA Central and NZPBA Southern title. The first title was competed on 6 October 2018, where Kiki Toa Leutele Knocked out Thomas Russell."

The club also announced former Rot-Weiß Oberhausen and Sportfreunde Siegen midfielder and SK Gaming co-founder Tim Reichert as Head of eSport.\nSchalke finished eighth in the 2016 Summer EU LCS and was relegated to the European \"League of Legends\" Challenger Series after losing a promotion match to Misfits Gaming. In December 2016, Steve and sprattel joined PSG eSports and left Schalke.\nSchalke announced a new roster on 13 January 2017, with SmittyJ, loulex, SELFIE, Upset and Vander joining the team. SELFIE and Vander left Schalke on 30 April 2017. Memento, Caedrel and Norskeren joined Schalke on 22 May 2017, as Jungler, Mid Laner and Support respectively. Schalke also released loulex on the same day.\nSchalke returned to the EU LCS on 25 August 2017, after defeating Ninjas in Pyjamas 3–0 in the 2018 EU LCS Spring Promotion tournament. On 30 September, Schalke released most of its roster: SmittyJ, Memento, Caedrel and Norskeren all announced their free agency via Twitter.\nOn 21 November 2017, Schalke announced the addition of Vizicsacsi, Pridestalker (now Pride), and Nukeduck to their roster as top laner, jungler, and mid laner respectively. Vander rejoined on the same day as Support. The team ended the 2018 EU LCS Spring Split in eighth place, but did not have to play in a promotion tournament as EUCS was abolished prior to the split. Amazing joined Schalke as starting jungler on 31 May 2018, after Pride was moved to a substitute role on 3 April. Schalke ended the 2018 EU LCS Summer Split in third place with a 12–6 record, qualifying the organisation for their first appearance in playoffs. The team managed to make it to the finals, but were defeated by Fnatic 1–3, and later failed to qualify for the 2018 World Championship after falling to G2 Esports 1–3 in the regional qualifiers.\nRiot Games announced on 20 November 2018 that Schalke would be one of ten franchise partners participating in the newly rebranded League of Legends European Championship (LEC). Schalke completely revised their roster prior to the 2019 Spring LEC, signing veterans top laner Tamás \"Vizicsacsi\" Kiss, jungler Jonas \"Memento\" Elmarghichi, and support Lee \"IgNar\" Dong-geun, and rookie mid laner Felix \"Abbedagge\" Braun. Despite a strong start to the regular season, Schalke ended in seventh place with a 9–9 record, barely missing playoffs.\nIn preparation for the 2019 Summer LEC, Schalke signed 2016 Summer EU LCS MVP Kim \"Trick\" Gang-yun to replace Memento in the jungle. The team ended the regular season in fourth place with an 11–7 record, qualifying for playoffs. After defeating Team Vitality and Rogue in the first and second round of playoffs respectively, Schalke moved on to the third round in Athens, where they were swept by Fnatic.\nSchalke 04 performed erratically in the 2020 LEC season. They came in 8th place of 10 in the Spring Split, and were considered a weaker team going into the Summer Split. Their initial results were poor, with an awful 1 win and 10 loss record, and were on the verge of being mathematically eliminated from playoff contention. Schalke proceeded to mount a dark horse \"miracle run\", however, after making adjustments to their jungle and bot lane positions. With Odoamne top lane, substitute jungler Gilius, Abbedagge in mid lane, and new bot laners Neon and Dreams, the team won out their remaining 7 games to narrowly qualify for 6th place and the playoffs. The head coach Dylan Falco explained in an interview at EarlyGame which changes in teamplay and tactics led them into the playoffs. In the playoffs, they defeated SK Gaming, but were themselves defeated by the MAD Lions. The team's surprising success attracted attention from other teams, and Odoamne left for Rogue, while Abbedagge left for 100 Thieves after the season concluded.\nIn 2021, Schalke 04 placed 4th in the LEC Spring Split. Despite their success in the Split, however, Schalke announced on June 29 that they would be selling their team slot and license in the LEC to the Swiss organization Team BDS for an estimated €26.5 million. The team has cited the COVID-19 pandemic and the parent club's relegation from Bundesliga as factors in the decision to leave the LEC. The 2021 Summer Split was their final appearance in the LEC; they finished last place in that split."

        "text": "Basketball is the most popular sport in Lithuania. Lithuanian-American basketball coaches and players in the 1930s helped the Lithuania men's national basketball team win the last EuroBasket tournaments prior to World War II, in 1937 and 1939, causing a massive impact in Lithuanian society and a basketball popularity spike. Since then, despite Lithuania's small size, with a population of just almost 2.9 million, the country's devotion to basketball has made them a traditional force of the sport in Europe.\nFollowing the country's annexation by the Soviet Union during the war, Lithuanian players frequently formed the core of the Soviet national team, and the Lithuanian people strongly supported local club BC Žalgiris, particularly against Russian squads. After the restoration of Lithuanian independence in 1990, the national team was resurrected, with their first official tournament being the 1992 Olympics, where they won a bronze medal. The Lithuanians have since won another two bronzes at the Olympics, a bronze medal at the 2010 FIBA World Championship, and five EuroBasket medals, including the country's third title at FIBA EuroBasket 2003 in Sweden.\nAt the professional club level, Žalgiris of Kaunas won the top-tier EuroLeague in 1999 and the second-tier FIBA Saporta Cup in 1998 and was also the FIBA Intercontinental Cup champion in 1986 under Soviet occupation. BC Lietuvos Rytas of Vilnius won two times the second-tier EuroCup, in 2005 and 2009.\nWhile basketball started being played in Lithuania by women, the women's national team has not achieved the same success as the male one, despite a title at EuroBasket Women 1997.\nHistory.\nInterwar period (1920–1940).\nBasketball was introduced in Lithuania indirectly through the European variety of Netball, featuring a smaller ball and no boards, brought by the Germans. In 1919 Lithuanian women athletes started organizing, and in 1920-1921 they started playing the game in public. The female pioneerism delayed basketball's widespread popularity until the 1930s as it kept being considered a woman's sport. In the meantime, in 1922 Karolis Dineika released the book \"Krepšiasvydis vyrams\" (English: Basketball for men), and in 1926 pilot Steponas Darius, who would later be known for his transatlantic flight, published the first basketball rules in Lithuania.\nDespite the fact that women were the first basketball players in Lithuania, the first official game was played by men. It took place on 23 April 1922 when Lietuvos Fizinio Lavinimo Sąjunga (English: Lithuanian Physical Education Union) played a game against Kaunas team, winning 8–6. That day is regarded as the beginning of basketball in Lithuania. The press at the time described the match by writing: \"The game was very interesting and left positive impression on the spectators. The observers were fascinated by the game so much that they felt living in a quite cultured country by watching our quick, joyful players. ... The audience heartily rejoiced at the gameplay of the excellent basketball players and applauded after shots and passes by Steponas Darius and Viktoras Dineika. ... Krepšiasvydis game, organized for the first time in Lithuania, gave beautiful hopes that in the future this game could lead our sportsmen to greater achievements\". Two years later, the first Lithuanian men's basketball tournament in Lithuania was organized, featuring two teams from LFLS and one from Lietuvos Dviračių Sąjunga (English: Lithuanian Cycles Union), and a course for basketball referees was held. The first class included Elena Garbačiauskienė and Steponas Darius. \nFrom 1926 to 1933, basketball saw its popularity decrease and get overshadowed by football. Basketball was played only during the summer period because there was no suitable indoor arena, and the game was mostly played by representatives of other sports, who allocated little time to it. The number of games played decreased, and the national championship was not even contested between 1929 and 1932. It started to change on 10 October 1934, the day where the Physical Culture Palace was opened in Kaunas. The building had a spacious hall with 200 seats, designed and built for tennis. To increase grip for tennis players, the hall had expensive cork floor installed, which cost over 30,000 LTL (over $5,000) when average teacher salary at the time was around 350–500 LTL and 150–180 LTL for an ordinary worker. Being suitable for indoor basketball, the Hall hosted its first game on 16 November 1934, and soon became the main center for basketball events. \nIn 1935, Lithuania decided to promote a World Lithuanian Congress in temporary capital Kaunas, inviting ethnic Lithuanians from many countries to unite the Lithuanian culture. The Lithuanian American community of Chicago decided to sponsor a team of athletes to participate in this Congress. The delegation included a full basketball team, which included University of Notre Dame star Moose Krause (Edward Kriaučiūnas) and his brother Phil (Feliksas Kriaučiūnas); basketballers Benedict Budrikas, Anthony Lauraitis, Victor Yanzanaitis and Julius Petrulaitis; and multi-sport athletes Konstantinas \"Konnie\" Savickus, Juozas \"Joseph\" Zukas, Peter Barskis, Michael A. Lukas, and Kazys \"Charles\" Sedvilas. After the three-week congress, Zukas and Savickus stayed to teach basketball secrets to Lithuanians. Savickus in particular became a player-coach to the national team, which had just been trounced by inaugural European champions Latvia, 123–10. One year later, with Savickus leading the team and exploiting stalling techniques, Lithuania trailed only 14–7 at halftime before losing, 31–10. The Lithuanian press declared it a moral victory.\nAlso in 1936, Lithuania applied to become a member of FIBA and take part in international basketball competitions, the first being EuroBasket 1937, the second European basketball tournament that the Latvia Basketball Association would organize in Riga as reigning champions. Thus while basketball would become an Olympic sport at the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Lithuania decided not to take part in the tournament, instead preparing for the following year. During the Olympics, one of the gold medalists, Frank Lubin, was of Lithuanian heritage, and was invited to visit the Baltic nation by a Lithuanian official in attendance. Going by the Lithuanian name Pranas Lubinas, he spent five months there and served as the country's first knowledgeable coach, helping spread various basketball techniques. Filling in for Savickus, who had returned to Chicago, Lubinas led Lithuania to its first victory over Latvia, 36-25.\nThe preparations for the EuroBasket 1937 started slowly, with players training only 4 hours a week. At first, it was decided that the national team at the tournament would not include any Lithuanian Americans; however the decision was reversed with only one month remaining, once a Latvian newspaper had printed an extensive article about the second European championship considering Lithuania the weakest of all contestants. Lithuanian player Leonas Baltrūnas was shocked at the article and along with journalist Jonas Narbutas, used a translated version of it to request the inclusion of Lithuanian Americans to Vytautas Augustauskas, director of the Physical Culture Palace. After a telegram was sent to the USA, two players arrived one month prior to the tournament, Pranas Talzūnas and Feliksas Kriaučiūnas, the latter of whom was designated as player-coach. To keep secrecy on how Lithuanian Americans were strengthening the team, all preparation games were cancelled and instead prolonged training sessions before the trip to Riga were held behind closed doors. The national team was being prepared not only technically, but also physically. Even once the reinforcements were made public, opponents were skeptic, with Talzūnas later remembering other teams felt he and Kriaučiūnas were not quality players as \"everyone thought that a good player must be tall, raising his hand and dunking into the basket.\"\nThe efforts were successful—the Lithuanians became the champions of Europe for the first time, defeating all their opponents and with Talzūnas being picked as the tournament's most valuable player. Following the final victory over Italy, the famous Lithuanian tenor Kipras Petrauskas even interrupted his performance at the State Theatre to joyfully announce the triumph of the national basketball team. The crowd then rose to their feet and together sang the Lithuanian anthem. The team returned to a warm reception, with thousands gathering at a train station in a way Kriaučiūnas compared to \"like we, here in America, greet the president.\" Basketball regained its ground immediately, and had its popularity rise abruptly, especially among students. Gymnasium teams from almost all counties competed in student games, teams were assembled in firms and basketball courts appeared all around the country. According to future player Stepas Butautas, \"In every yard hoops are being made from barrels. Children, teenagers are throwing balls into them, others—even a sock crammed with clouts. Our Veršvai Primary School teacher K. Požemecka built two poles, made hoops from a willow and said: 'We will play basketball'.\" Future team coach Vladas Garastas added that \"as kids we started using a barrel to make a hoop. We didn't have a ball, we stuffed in grass or whatever we could find\". Kriaučiūnas also coached the women's national team that did well at the first European women's basketball championship, organized in 1938 in Rome. With three victories in four games, the Lithuanian women finished second behind hosts Italy.\nLithuania was granted the right to organize the EuroBasket 1939. In addition, the Kaunas Sports Hall, Europe's first dedicated basketball arena, was built. In the competition, the team roster mostly consisted of Lithuanian Americans, with five American-born players: the returning Feliksas Kriaučiūnas (Chicago), Juozas Jurgėla (Chicago), Vytautas Budriūnas (Waukegan), Mykolas Ruzgys and Pranas Lubinas (Glendale). As a result, there were several protests from other nations. Lubinas, who was the designated player-coach, lead Lithuania to a second continental title, even scoring the buzzer-beater in the decisive game against Latvia, which warranted a 37–36 victory.\nTeam dissolution during World War II.\nAfter two consecutive EuroBasket titles, Pranas Lubinas dreamed of leading Lithuania at the 1940 Summer Olympics. Sadly, it remained only a dream as the World War II broke out one year before and the Olympics were cancelled. With Nazi Germany invading Europe and the Soviet Union occupying the Baltic states in 1940, the Lithuanian basketball players and basketball-supporting president Antanas Smetona left for safer countries such as the United States and Australia. Only a few of them had a chance to return to Lithuania in 1989-1990. As a consequence, none of the European champions played for the Soviet Union after the war ended. The EuroBasket 1941 was due to take place in Lithuania as well, but was cancelled due to the war. Instead, Lithuania only hosted a Baltic states tournament organized at Kaunas Sports Hall in April 1941, beating Latvia 38–33 in front of 6000 spectators. Two months later, mass Soviet deportations from Lithuania began. Juozas Butrimas, Siberia deportations survivor, once said: \"Our whole sports club was falsely accused of participating in an anti-Soviet Lithuanian resistance organization. In Siberia, we built a regulation basketball court. Basketball allowed us to have dignity, to retain our sense of humanity. How did I survived? Basketball gave a lot. They didn't bury me there\".\nDuring the rest of the war, with the Germans occupying Lithuania in November 1941 and the Soviets taking it back three years later, all the basketballers who did not escape the country went through difficult times. Vincas Sercevičius, often nicknamed as the second Lubinas, had to run away from German raids in 1943. Two years later, Sercevičius was a member of the Žalgiris Kaunas who refused to purposefully lose to CSKA Moscow, leading him and other teammates, along with coach Stasys Šačkus, to end up shipped to the Vorkuta Gulag by the Soviets.\nSoviet period (1947–1990).\nThe first Soviet Union national basketball team was formed in 1947 to participate in EuroBasket 1947, immediately winning gold medals. The team had four Lithuanians: Stepas Butautas, Justinas Lagunavičius, Kazimieras Petkevičius and Vytautas Kulakauskas.\nGiven the Soviet Union was absent from the 1948 Summer Olympics, Lithuanian basketballers could only fulfill their dreams of playing on the Olympic stage at the 1952 Olympic Games, where they qualified by winning EuroBasket 1951. The Soviets got a silver medal, losing only two games against the United States, who had a height advantage—the shortest of their players was still taller than the highest Soviet—and would soon become the USSR's biggest rival. The team was led by Georgian player Otar Korkia (17.3 points per game), along with Lithuanians Stepas Butautas (10.6 points) and Kazimieras Petkevičius (8.1 points). Two other Lithuanians, Justinas Lagunavičius and Stanislovas Stonkus, were also in the team. The four are regarded as the first Lithuania-born Olympic basketball players. Years later, Modestas Paulauskas served as the Soviet Union captain starting in 1969, and would lead the USSR to an historic upset of the United States at the 1972 Olympic Games, making them the first Olympic champions other than the Americans.\nAccording to journalist and future LKL employee Arūnas Pakula, \"We felt like an occupied nation. We had no weapons to use. The only opportunity to prove ourselves against the Soviets was in basketball.\" Despite not being able to challenge the Soviet Union on basketball court, Lithuanians still did that in another way. Basketball club Žalgiris Kaunas, established in 1944 (just a few years after the country's occupation) with a name commemorating the Battle of Grunwald, became one of the main non-violent resistance ways. Games between Žalgiris and CSKA Moscow, a military basketball team mostly formed from best Soviet Union basketball players, were \"de facto\" games between Lithuania and the Soviet Union, and led to mass rallies of sorts once Lithuanians went to receive Žalgiris' players at airports after victories. The teams from Baltic states even tried to help each other during the Soviet tournaments, most notably in 1973. During the last round, the already qualified Žalgiris Kaunas deliberately lost to Kalev Tallinn, as admitted by Paulauskas: \"We gave victory to Tallinn Kalev. That game meant nothing for us, while for Estonians it was crucial in order to avoid the fight for the survival in the highest league\". During the Stagnation and subsequent dissolution of the Soviet Union, the success of Lithuanian basketball provided many moments to showcase their nationalism against the Soviet dominance. The 1981 students sport games in Vilnius had the locals attending in the Lithuanian green and yellow colors to see the national youth team led by Arvydas Sabonis and Šarūnas Marčiulionis defeat the Moscow squad. In the 1980s, Žalgiris defeated CSKA three times in a row for the USSR Premier Basketball League finals (1985–1987). One of their players, Sergejus Jovaiša, stated that in 1987 CSKA was even preparing a huge celebration with orchestra and flowers before the defeat. Žalgiris also won the 1986 Intercontinental Cup in Argentina, receiving much support from the home crowd against the Yugoslavs of Zagreb Cibona. Their return to Europe attracted a huge crowd, with Žalgiris captain Valdemaras Chomičius stating that in Aleksotas Airport \"it seemed that the whole Kaunas gathered that early morning.\"\nIn 1988, Atlanta Hawks which included its major star Dominique Wilkins became the first NBA club to visit Lithuania and played friendly game with the Soviet Union national team in the Vilnius Palace of Concerts and Sports. Later, the Soviet Union squad became Olympic champions in the 1988 Summer Olympics for the second and the last time, defeating the United States, 82–76, in the semi-finals and Yugoslavia 76–63 in the finals. The team mostly was led by four Lithuanians: Šarūnas Marčiulionis (18.1 points, 2.3 assists per game), Rimas Kurtinaitis (13.4 points, 3 rebounds), Arvydas Sabonis (13.3 points, 11.1 rebounds) and team captain Valdemaras Chomičius (7.4 points, 1.5 rebounds). Vytautas Landsbergis, the first head of state of Lithuania after its independence declaration from the Soviet Union, once said: \"The majority of the team was made up of Lithuanians. So really Lithuania won that gold medal for the Soviet Union. But its name wasn't there. And that was another injustice that we had to correct\".\nThe Soviet national team failed to qualify for EuroBasket 1991 following Lithuania's declaration of independence on 11 March 1990. During the 43 years where the Soviets had Lithuanian players, they managed to get with both male and female squads 17 Olympic medals (8 gold, 6 silver and 3 bronze), 17 World championship medals (11 gold, 5 silver and one bronze), and 51 EuroBasket medals (36 gold, 4 silver and 11 bronze). The occupation left many painful marks in Lithuania and Lithuanians' memory. Games between Žalgiris and CSKA, as well as games between Lithuania and Russian national teams, still have extra spice in them nowadays. Singing of the Lithuanian anthem before the professional club's games in Lithuania is still a rare tradition, rarely found outside the National Basketball Association in Europe.\nNotable players (men).\nNotable Lithuanians who never played for Lithuania national basketball team.\nThere have been a few notable Lithuanians who never played for Lithuania national basketball team in FIBA-organized tournaments or the Olympic Games.

        "text": "The 2016 Major League Baseball Home Run Derby (known through sponsorship as the T-Mobile Home Run Derby) was a home run hitting contest between eight batters from Major League Baseball (MLB). The derby was held on July 11, 2016, at Petco Park in San Diego, California, the site of the 2016 MLB All-Star Game. On July 8, the participants that will be eligible to participate in the Home Run Derby were announced. Giancarlo Stanton won the Home Run Derby by defeating defending champion Todd Frazier 20–13.\nRules.\nEight players participated in the derby in a bracket-style, single-elimination timed event. Each player had four minutes to hit as many home runs as possible. Hitters were awarded an additional 30 seconds if they hit two home runs over . Hitters were also allowed one 45 second timeout to stop the clock (two in the finals). Homers hit off a T-Mobile Ball during the final minute resulted in a $10,000 donation to charity by T-Mobile &amp; MLB, to the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America.\nThe eight competing players were seeded 1-8 based on their home run totals. The higher seed hit second in any round, and the round ended if the higher seed surpassed the total of the first hitter. In the event of a tie, the two hitters competed in a one-minute swing-off (with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded). If there remained a tie, each player got three swings; whoever hit more home runs in the three swings would be declared the winner; thereafter, sudden death swings would occur until the tie was broken."

        "text": "The 2015 Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) Draft was held on October 22, , for the 51st time at the Grand Prince Hotel Takanawa to assign amateur baseball players to the NPB. It was arranged with the special cooperation of Taisho Pharmaceutical Co. with official naming rights. The draft was officially called \"The Professional Baseball Draft Meeting supported by Lipovitan D\".\nSummary.\nThis was the third year in a row that Taisho Pharmaceuticals had been a partner for the NPB draft and as such one of their most prominent products \"Lipovitan D\" was used in the official name becoming \"Professional Baseball Draft meeting supported by Lipovitan D.\"\nOnly the first round picks were allowed to be contested with all picks from the second round onward being based on table placing in the 2015 NPB season in a waiver system. Waiver priority was changed from All-Star game results to inter-league results. As the Pacific League teams came out on top with 61 wins, 44 losses and 3 draws against Central League opposition, Pacific League teams were given preference. From the third round the order was reversed continuing in the same fashion until all picks were exhausted.\nFor the first time since 1974, the Yomiuri Giants were without a manager present at the draft. In the previous instance, that year's manager Tetsuharu Kawakami was to be replaced by Shigeo Nagashima who was absent due to his participation in the MLB Japan All-Star Series having still been an active player.\n88 new players were signed at the draft with a further 28 development player contracts decided on.\nLottery Mistake.\nIn the competition for the signature of Meiji University's Shun Takayama between Tokyo Yakult Swallows and the Hanshin Tigers there was an error leading to some trouble at the meeting.\nAt the lottery, both team managers Tomoaki Kanemoto and Mitsuru Manaka both pulled their tickets and it was Manaka who pulled his ticket first mistaking the draft logo for the \"winning\" stamp, raising his fist in a victory pose. Kanemoto, after seeing the Swallows manager's delight, felt that he had lost and went back to his seat without checking his ticket.\nAfter checking the \"winning\" ticket, NPB officials realized immediately that there had been a mistake but before other officials could check the Hanshin ticket, an interview with Manaka had already started. In regards to this, NPB secretary general Atsuhi Iihara later apologized \"we should have stopped the interview but we couldn't. It was a clumsy piece of work.\"\nAfter it was confirmed that Hanshin had indeed won the rights to negotiate, Kanemoto laughingly remarked \"it was like a home run that had been taken away by video replay.\"\nIn the aftermath, Takayama made comment that \"it was a meeting where you didn't now what was going to happen, I certainly didn't, but I'm very appreciative to have been selected in the first round of picks.\"\nThe mistaken Manaka, commented \"please return my celebration.\" As a result of the systems trouble, the draft was delayed by 10 minutes."

Long and Billy Shindle hold the record for most fielding errors in a season, with Long committing 122 errors in 1889, and Shindle committing 122 errors the following year in 1890.

        "text": "Peter Block (1933 - December 13, 2015) was a co-founder and former-owner of the National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins. He was a part of the team's ownership for just one season, selling in his share in 1968. Block rejoined the ownership group in 1971, though, and kept his stake until the team went bankrupt in 1975. He relocated to California in the mid-1980s to start a business venture and died on December 13, 2015, at his home in Santa Monica from cancer.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nBlock and Jack McGregor, a Republican Pennsylvania State Senator from Pittsburgh, came up with the idea for the club in 1965, during a car trip along the Pennsylvania Turnpike when they heard the NHL planned to expand from six to 12 teams. Block stated to McGregor that in order for Pittsburgh to be a true sports town, in needed to have an NHL team. The two men, who were classmates at the University of Pittsburgh School of Law, gathered together a group of investors, that included HJ Heinz II, Art Rooney, and Richard Scaife, and made their successful proposal to the NHL. Pittsburgh was awarded a franchise and McGregor and Block each owned a 12.5 percent share of the team. According to McGregor, Block initially laughed to him for McGregor's wife, Carol, coming up with the name \"Penguins\". Block argued against the name and favored naming the club the Hornets, from Pittsburgh's long-time and successful affiliate in the American Hockey League.\nBlock, and several other Penguins' investors, also purchased a second professional franchise in 1967, the Pittsburgh Phantoms, a soccer team in the non-FIFA sanctioned National Professional Soccer League. The club played for just one season folded before the 1968 NASL season due to poor attendance, drawing only an average of 3,122. The Phantoms' financial losses also tapped out Block and many of the Penguins' investors.\nAside from his ownership duties, Block was also the team's vice president and chief operating officer during the season. At end of the team's inaugural season, Block relinquished his share in the team. However he rejoined the ownership group in 1971. During his ownership tenure, Block would bring his stepchildren to the team Christmas party, and his wife, Ida, even gave guitar lessons to former Penguins winger Bob \"Battleship\" Kelly.\nAt the end of the Penguins' 1974-75 season, the team filed for bankruptcy. The ownership group had been negotiating a plan to keep the team while beginning to pay $532,000 in overdue withholding taxes, however a local management change in the team. On June 12, 1975, IRS agents walked into the Pittsburgh Civic Arena and placed a tax lien against the Penguins.

The race took place on May 6, 1933.\nThe first two finishers of the race were Brokers Tip, ridden by Don Meade, and Head Play, ridden by Herb Fisher. Head Play led early, but Brokers Tip went through an opening on the inside to pull even. As the horses ran side-by-side down the stretch, their jockeys grabbed and whipped each other, and the race became known as the \"fighting finish.\" The racing stewards declared Brokers Tip the winner by a nose. It was the only victory of his career.\nMeade and Fisher later fought in the jockey's room; both were suspended for 30 days for their actions during the race. Fisher claimed that Head Play had won and that Brokers Tip should have been disqualified. Meade, when interviewed 50 years later, said, \"I couldn't push him away from me because he had ahold of me, so I had to get ahold of him. So from there down to the wire, that's what it was - grab and grab and grab.\""

        "text": "Women's rugby league is a popular women's sport in Australia. The sport has a high level of participation in the country both recreational and professional. Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) is the national governing body of the sport in Australia, organising the Australian Women's Rugby League, the Australian women's national team, and the nine state governing bodies of the game, among other duties. Women's participation of modern rugby league has been recorded since the early 1920s. It has since become one of Australia's most popular women's team sports.\nHistory.\n1920s.\nThe first Women's Rugby League match in Australia was played in Sydney, on Saturday, 17 September 1921. Players, who had been training in the preceding months, had been divided into two teams, named Metropolitan (who played in blue jerseys) and Sydney (who played in maroon jerseys). Metropolitan won the match 21–11. The crowd of 30,000 was the largest ever for women’s sport in Australia for many years. A second 'return' match was played the following Saturday, 24 September 1921. Three matches were held in 1922 in April, August and October. The organisation was disbanded prior to the 1923 season. \n1970s.\nIn the mid-1970s Women's Rugby League teams were organised in Perth, including South Perth and Cottesloe.\nIn 1976, a Women's Rugby League team from Manurewa in Auckland, New Zealand toured Australia. The Manurewa club had earlier received junior boys teams from Goulburn and Lalor Park, Sydney and these two clubs offered to host a visit from Manurewa's ladies team. A women's team was formed in Goulburn to play against the tourists. They played two matches, one in Goulburn and another at Endeavour Field in Cronulla. The Lalor Park team had played and won four local matches prior to their match against Manurewa.\n1990s.\nIn the early part of the 1990s Women's Rugby League competitions were run in Sydney, the Illawarra and the Australian Capital Territory. Some of the clubs from those regions participated in an annual knock-out competition. The East Canberra club won this knock-out tournament in three consecutive years: 1991, 1992 and 1993. Other participating clubs included the Albion Park Outlaws, Calwell Colts, North Sydney, Northern Districts Illawarra, Warilla Warriors, Woden Valley and the Wollongong Wildcats. In the final of the 1994 tournament, Picton defected Bulli.\nIn 1995, Australia hosted a tour by the New Zealand national team. This was the inaugural series of Test Matches for both countries in Women's Rugby League. Tour matches were played in Sydney, Canberra and Brisbane.\nIn 1996, Australia hosted a seven match, three Test tour by the Great Britain women's national rugby league team. Australia claimed their inaugural international win in the First Test in Canberra. Great Britain, however, won the Second Test in Brisbane and the Third Test at Redfern Oval in Sydney to claim a series victory.\nThe Australian national team toured New Zealand in 1997 (both matches lost) and Fiji in 1998 (both matches won). Hosting duties for a Test Match series in 1999 were shared with New Zealand with games played at Leichhardt Oval and Penrith Stadium in Sydney and the third and final match played in Auckland. Australia beat New Zealand for the first time in the Second Test at Penrith, but the Kiwi Ferns won the series, 2–1.\nThe women's game in Queensland expanded from Brisbane and Ipswich in 1998 when a competition commenced in Mackay. Souths beat the previously undefeated Norths in the Grand Final.\nDuring the later years of the 1990s National Championships were conducted with representative, rather than club, teams participating. In 1997, Illawarra beat Brisbane in the final. The 1998 tournament was held at Pizzey Park, Burleigh Heads and included teams from Sydney, Canberra, Illawarra, Brisbane, Ipswich and for the first time Western Australia. The 1999 tournament was reconfigured to have four state/territory teams. New South Wales beat Queensland in the final, ahead of Western Australia and the Australian Capital Territory.\nThe year 1999 saw the introduction of an interstate series between Queensland and New South Wales. The teams play for the Nellie Doherty Cup. Although this ongoing series was occasionally referred to in the media as the Women's State of Origin the respective teams were selected on a residential basis until 2017. Queensland won this augural match, 16–14.\n2000s.\nAustralia participated in the inaugural Women's Rugby League World Cup in November 2000, playing two matches each against Great Britain &amp; Ireland and New Zealand. The Australian squad comprised players from the Australian Capital Territory, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia.\nNational Championships were held at Belmont, Western Australia in 2000, Rooty Hill, New South Wales in 2001, Ipswich, Queensland in 2002, West Belconnen, Australian Capital Territory in 2003, Runaway Bay, Queensland in 2005, and Queanbeyan, New South Wales in 2006. Queensland won the tournament in 2000 and 2001. In 2003, Queensland Whites defeated Queensland Maroons in the final, ahead of ACT and NSW teams. The tournament was not held in 2004. In 2005, South East Queensland beat a Queensland Barbarians team in the final, ahead of NSW City and NSW Country teams. in 2006, Brisbane beat Sydney Metro in the final, ahead of NSW Country Monaro and NSW Country Southern Division teams.\nThe 2008 Women's Rugby League World Cup was the first held in Australia from 26 October, culminating in the final between Australian Jillaroos and the Kiwi Ferns on 22 November. It was held at Stockland Park alongside the Police World Cup. Eight teams took part including defending champions New Zealand.\n2010s.\nThe 2011 All Stars match included the first Women's All Stars exhibition match which was won by the NRL Women's All Stars 22–6.\nIn 2016 the first local derby by NRL clubs was played Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks and St. George Illawarra Dragons had a Women's rugby league nines match at Southern Cross Group Stadium which aired on Fox Sports it was a curtain-raiser for the main game Sharks won 16–12.\nThe New South Wales Rugby League announced the creation of a nine-a-side under-18s women's league for 2017 Named the Tarsha Gale Nines after the former Australian Jillaroos and NSW captain of the 1990s.\nFor the first time in the sport's history the 2017 Women's Rugby League World Cup was held concurrently with the men's tournament.\nOn 14 May 2017 the first Women's City vs Country Origin game was played.\nNational Championships.\nThe Women's Rugby League Australian National Championships have continually evolved since their establishment in the early 1990s. The tournament was initially for club sides, with the ability of the players to self-fund their travel to the tournament being a factor in the number of teams participating. 1994 saw a change to regional representative teams. In 2018 and 2019 the tournament featured the best Australian-based players in the women's game. With the advent and success of the NRL Women's Premiership NRLW, the tournament was revised to have a development focus on emerging talent.\nFor the 2022 National Championships, a four-team Under 19 tournament was run in addition to the six-team open age tournament. Queensland Rubys (10) defeated NSW City (4) in the final. The other Under 19 teams were NSW Country and the Queensland Sapphires.\nRecent Tournaments.\nThe format of the National Championships was restructured ahead of the 2023 tournament. The NRL announced that to further focus on player development and opportunities for players to be seen by NRLW clubs, there would be no official winner. Teams were divided into three pools for the first three days of the four-day tournament. On the fourth and final day, teams would be paired off for matches based on earlier results. &lt;br&gt;\nA New Zealand team, named \"Ahi Ka Aotearoa\", entered the 2023 tournament. &lt;br&gt;\nFiji and Papua New Guinea teams entered the 2024 tournament. To accommodate these teams and preserve the twelve team structure, Queensland dropped from two teams to one team and NSW Country (Under 19's) and NSW Emerging Country (Open Age) merged."

        "text": "The 1971–72 Serie A basketball championship was the 49th season of the Serie A, the highest professional basketball league in Italy.\nThe regular season ran from 24 October 1971 to 4 April 1972, twelve teams played 22 games each. As Simmenthal Milano and Ignis Varese ended joint first with an equal head-to-head record, a single playoff game decided the title for the second year running.\nMilano won the game, played in Rome, to break Varese's three-year title streak, taking home their nineteenth overall title (and a spot in the European Champions Cup).\nTo accommodate a league expansion to 14 teams due the following year, only one side was relegated that season, newly promoted Stella Azzurra Roma went straight back to the Serie B.\nPreseason.\nHolders Ignis Varese were seen as the favourites to retain their title, with habitual rivals Simmenthal Milano – whom they had beat in a title playoff game the previous season – as challengers.\nAmbitious teams Forst Cantù and Splügen Venezia could take a few points off the leading duo but were not considered as strong enough to join the title fight.\nA Nikolić coached Ignis had kept all their major players, with star Mexican Manuel Raga complemented by Italian internationals Dino Meneghin, Ottorino Flaborea, and Ivan Bisson among others.\nThe addition of Tony Gennari and Marino Zanatta (both from Mobilquattro Milano, the re-sponsored All'Onestà) had created an abundance of star players in their squad, something ironically seen as their only potential weakness.\nSimmenthal, coached by Cesare Rubini, had virtually kept the same squad yet were seen as more potent, with combative American Art Kenney settled in and youngsters Giulio Iellini and Mauro Cerioni more mature.\nRegular season.\nSimmenthal's title hopes took a dent when they lost 69-67 away to Forst Cantù during the fourth round, leaving Ignis as the only undefeated team at that stage. \nWhen the two met in Varese on 9 January 1972, Simmenthal was already in a do-or-die situation, trailing the leaders by four points (having lost again in between, to mid-table Norda Bologna led by league top scorer John Fultz).\nIgnis' 62-57 win in a nervous game characterized by poor shooting from both sides (Bisson and Renzo Bariviera top-scoring for their respective teams with 16 points each) led some observers to already declare them champions, with their now 6-point lead seen as insurmountable. \nHowever, the same month, Pierluigi Marzorati and Carlo Recalcati helped Cantù end Ignis' four-year invulnerability at home with an 84-83 overtime win that made that claim less certain. \nSoon after, the leaders lost by a single point again, this time to Venezia after two overtimes, to see their lead on Simmenthal reduced to only two points.\nThat gap remained the same until the penultimate round game between the two freshly crowned European champions (Ignis winning the Champions Cup and Simmenthal the Cup Winners' Cup) played on 26 March 1972 in Milan. \nContrarily to the previous encounter, the game was reportedly an entertaining affair, Cerioni neutralised a diminished Raga defensively whilst adding 18 points to a vindictive Kenney's 21. Meneghin's 28 points were not enough for a Varese missing the injured Bisson, as they were undone 77-72 to concede their hold on first place. \nBoth teams comfortably won their last round games, which meant they finished as joint leaders, making a one-off playoff game at a neutral venue necessary to decide the title.\nStandings.\nSource: Lega Basket\nIndividual scoring table.\n\"Source: unofficial statistics compiled by the Giganti del Basket magazine (official statistics started from the 1975–76 season).\"\nPostseason.\nTitle playoff.\nThe title-deciding playoff game was played in Rome's Palazzo dello Sport on 4 April 1972 in front of more than 15,000 people.\nRaga, having returned to fitness, scored a game-high 25 points, with Meneghin adding 22 points for the defending champions as Varese led by 9 points in the first half.\nDespite this, a team-effort by Simmenthal's mayor players such as Kenney, Giuseppe Brumatti and captain Massimo Masini allowed them to get back in the game, with the teams tied on 60 with only 29 seconds left to play.\nBarivera scored twice in succession to allow Milano to win the closely contested game and the league title for the first time in five years.\nItalian Cup.\nSimmenthal completed the domestic double over Ignis, beating their rivals 81-77 in Turin to lift the cup.\nAs both teams were already qualified for the 1972–73 European Champions Cup (Milano through the league and Varese by winning the 1972 edition), the spot in the European Cup Winners' Cup was given to Mobilquattro Milano after they beat Forst Cantù 84-83 in the third-place game.\nChampionship-winning squad.\nSimmenthal Milano 1971–72 Serie A champions\nSource: Lega Basket"

He currently serves as head coach for the Winnipeg Sea Bears of the Canadian Elite Basketball League (CEBL). Previously, he was head coach of the Poland national team, which he led to the Round of 16 at the 2015 EuroBasket and the quarter-finals of the 2019 FIBA World Cup.\nBefore he coached Poland, he led several professional teams in the United States and Germany.\nCoaching career.\nHamburg Towers.\nOn 23 May 2018, Taylor signed a two-year contract with Hamburg Towers of the German second tier ProA.\nHe was sitting there without notice and without being noticed until a journalist walking up the steps recognized the spectator who knew a bit more about basketball than all the others there.\nIn the stand for the first game of day three at the IWBF Wheelchair Basketball World Championships was Mike Taylor, the new head coach of the Hamburg Towers, a second tier ProA team in the Basketball Bundesliga with greater aspirations. He was brought in this season to bring the Towers, whose home court is this same arena, to the top level. The two teams he was watching push up and down the court below – the United States and Poland national wheelchair basketball teams - are already among the world's best.\nAn American from western Pennsylvania where his dad was a coach, Taylor was nonetheless split on his loyalties. For the last five years, he has been working as head coach for the Poland national team, coaching NBA and top European league players.\nFriendly and immediately affable, the coach related that he had met members of the Polish wheelchair basketball staff and team when the two squads shared a training facility.\nMike Taylor will be the new head coach of the Hamburg Towers from the 2018/19 season. The Wilhelmsburg and 45-year-old agreed on a two-year contract. Taylor currently oversees the Polish national team. Benka Barloschky, who stepped in as an interim coach last season, will assist him.\n“Mike is definitely our preferred candidate and was at the top of the list when we started looking for a coach. With this very experienced and highly recognized coach in Europe as well as in the US, we made a big impression. His profile is impressive: Mike has demonstrated that he can lead teams to promotion, has already coached in the Bundesliga, gained experience in dealing with the best of the best in the D-League, and has done an excellent job in Eastern Europe, where some of our players come from Reputation worked out. This is a portfolio that not many trainers can show. Since he has an extremely positive, winning way of doing this, he fits 100 percent with the Hamburg Towers. An absolute plus is his great interest in promoting young people, which he has repeatedly shown from the very first interview. He helped players like Per Günther and Robin Benzing to start their careers and ultimately helped them to the highest levels. We would like to follow a similar path here in Hamburg, ”says Towers managing director and sports director Marvin Willoughby.\n In his first season, he won the championship with the club and led Hamburg to its first promotion to the Basketball Bundesliga (BBL)."

        "title": "2017 World Series",
        "text": "The 2017 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball's (MLB) 2017 season. The 113th edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the National League (NL) champion Los Angeles Dodgers and the American League (AL) champion Houston Astros. The series was played between October 24 and November 1.\nThe Astros defeated the Dodgers, four games to three, to win their first World Series in franchise history, also becoming the first team from Texas to do so. They became the second team in postseason history to win two Game 7s in one postseason, after the 1985 Kansas City Royals. It was the first time since 2001–2002 when two consecutive World Series went to seven games. Both teams set a World Series record with a combined total of 25 home runs throughout the entire series, including a team record 15 home runs by the Astros, and 10 homeruns by the Dodgers, and hit a combined total of eight home runs in Game 2 to set the single game World Series mark. Houston outfielder George Springer was named the World Series Most Valuable Player (MVP) after hitting five home runs in the series to tie a World Series record with Reggie Jackson in 1977 and Chase Utley in 2009.\nThis was the first World Series in which home-field advantage was decided by the regular season record of the two pennant winners. From 1903 to 2002, home-field advantage had been determined by coin flips and by alternating between the AL and NL. From 2003 to 2016, it was determined by results from that season's All-Star Game, when it was awarded to the team from the winning league. The Dodgers earned home-field advantage over the Astros. The series was played in a 2–3–2 format, with the Dodgers hosting Games 1, 2, 6, and 7; and the Astros hosting Games 3, 4, and 5.\nThe Astros' victory was marred in 2019 after a league investigation had revealed that they had illegally utilized a system to steal signs from opposing teams during their championship season. As a result, the Astros were fined $5 million and docked several top draft picks, while Astros manager A. J. Hinch and general manager Jeff Luhnow were suspended for one year; both were subsequently fired. However, Commissioner of Baseball Rob Manfred opted against punishing any of the players involved or revoking the Astros' World Series title.\nBackground.\nThis was the first World Series matchup, and second postseason meeting overall, between the Astros and Dodgers. Los Angeles defeated Houston in five games in the 1981 National League Division Series, en route to first their World Series championship since 1965. The teams also met in the 1980 National League West tie-breaker game, won by the Astros at Dodger Stadium. This was the first Fall Classic since , and the eighth overall, in which both participants had 100 or more wins during the regular season.\nThe two teams did not meet in interleague play during the regular season.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nThe Dodgers held a 91–36 record through August 25 and ended the season with a 104–58 record. They won their fifth consecutive National League West title and home-field advantage throughout the entire playoffs as the overall #1 seed. In the postseason, the Dodgers swept the 4th-seeded Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League Division Series and then defeated the number 3 seed and defending World Series champion Chicago Cubs in the previous year's rematch of the National League Championship Series in five games, leading to the fourth time since 2000 that two teams played each other in consecutive League Championship Series. This was the first appearance in the Fall Classic for the Dodgers since 1988, the tenth since the franchise moved from Brooklyn to Los Angeles in 1958, and the 19th overall.\nEntering the 2017 World Series, the Dodgers bullpen had thrown 23 consecutive scoreless innings, a postseason record for a bullpen. Additionally, by outscoring the Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago Cubs by a combined 48–19 margin, the Dodgers entered the World Series with the third-best run differential of any pennant winner since the playoff structure was expanded in 1995.\nAll-Star shortstop Corey Seager, who was out for the entire National League Championship Series with a back injury, was included on the Dodgers' World Series roster. Manager Dave Roberts became first manager of Asian heritage ever in the World Series, as well as the fourth African-American manager. The Dodgers had their second consecutive Rookie of the Year, Cody Bellinger, who hit 39 home runs in 2017. Clayton Kershaw finished second in Cy Young award voting, and closer Kenley Jansen finished fifth. The Dodgers had six NL All-Stars in Bellinger, Seager, Justin Turner, Kershaw, Alex Wood, and Jansen.\nHouston Astros.\nWith a 101–61 regular season record, the team won its first American League West title, their first division title since 2001, and the #2 seed in the AL. In the American League Division Series, they defeated the 3rd-seeded Boston Red Sox in four games and then defeated the 4th-seeded New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series (ALCS) in seven games. This was their second World Series appearance, first since 2005, when they were swept in four games by the Chicago White Sox and first appearance as a member of the American League (which the team joined in 2013), as they became the first team in history to make it to the World Series as members of both National and American Leagues.\nThe city of Houston in August 2017 suffered record flooding from Hurricane Harvey. The team began to wear patches which had the logo of the team with the word \"Strong\" on the bottom of the patch, as well as promoting the hashtag \"Houston Strong\". Manager A. J. Hinch has stated in an interview that the team wasn't just playing for a title, but to help boost moral support for the city.\nOn August 31, just seconds before the midnight deadline, the Astros traded for Detroit Tigers pitcher Justin Verlander. Following the trade, including the regular season and postseason to this point, Verlander had posted a 9–0 win–loss record with a 1.23 earned run average. He was named the ALCS MVP.\nGame summaries.\nGame 1.\nThe temperature at the start of the game was , which made this the hottest World Series game ever recorded. Clayton Kershaw started Game 1 for the Dodgers, while Dallas Keuchel started for the Astros.\nChris Taylor hit a home run for the Dodgers on Keuchel's first pitch of the game. It was the third home run to leadoff a game in Dodgers postseason history (following Davey Lopes in 1978 World Series and Carl Crawford in 2013 NLDS). Alex Bregman hit a tying home run for the Astros in the fourth inning. In the sixth inning, Justin Turner hit a go-ahead two-run home run for the Dodgers. Turner tied Duke Snider for most career runs batted in (RBIs) in Dodgers postseason history with 26. \nKershaw struck out 11 in seven innings pitched with no walks and only three hits allowed while Keuchel allowed three runs on six hits in innings. Brandon Morrow pitched a scoreless eighth and Kenley Jansen earned the save. \nThe two-hour, 28-minute game was the shortest World Series contest since Game 4 in .\nGame 2.\nThe starting pitchers for Game 2 were Rich Hill for the Dodgers and Justin Verlander for the Astros. The Astros scored first when Bregman drove in Josh Reddick with a hit in the third inning. Hill struck out seven in four innings but was replaced by Kenta Maeda in the fifth. Joc Pederson tied the game with a home run in the bottom of the fifth inning, and the Dodgers took the lead when Corey Seager hit a two-run home run after Taylor walked in the bottom of the sixth inning. Verlander allowed two hits, both home runs, in his six innings pitched. Carlos Correa drove in the Astros' second run of the game on a single in the eighth, ending the Dodgers bullpen's streak of 28 consecutive scoreless innings in the postseason. Marwin González hit a home run off Jansen in the ninth to tie the game. This was only Jansen's second blown save all season and snapped his streak of converting his first 12 postseason save opportunities, a major league record.\nThe game went into extra innings. José Altuve and Correa hit back-to-back home runs off Josh Fields in the tenth inning to put the Astros in the lead. Yuli Gurriel doubled after the home run, but Fields was replaced by Tony Cingrani and Gurriel was stranded. In the bottom of the inning, Yasiel Puig hit a solo home run off of Ken Giles and Enrique Hernández drove in Logan Forsythe, who had walked and advanced on a wild pitch, to tie the game, with the latter being the Dodgers' first run that was not driven in by a home run. In the next inning, pinch-hitter Cameron Maybin singled and stole second. George Springer hit a two-run home run for the Astros off of Brandon McCarthy to retake the lead. In the bottom of the 11th inning, Charlie Culberson homered off of Chris Devenski, who later struck out Puig to end the game. This was the first ever World Series game in which a team hit home runs in the ninth, tenth and eleventh inning. The teams set a new record for combined home runs in a single World Series game with eight and this was the first time in MLB history, regular season or postseason, that five home runs were hit in extra innings. The Astros won their first World Series game in franchise history as they had been swept in their previous appearance in 2005.\nGame 3.\nThe starting pitchers for Game 3 were Yu Darvish for the Dodgers and Lance McCullers Jr. for the Astros. The Astros scored four runs in the bottom of the second inning on a home run by Yuli Gurriel and RBIs by González, Brian McCann, and Bregman. Darvish left the game after innings, which was the shortest outing of his career. The Dodgers scored one run in the top of the third inning as Seager grounded into a double play after McCullers loaded the bases with three consecutive walks. The Astros added another run in the fifth on an RBI single by Evan Gattis and the Dodgers added two in the sixth on an RBI groundout by Puig and a wild pitch. McCullers wound up pitching 5 innings and allowed three runs on four hits. Brad Peacock replaced McCullers, completing the final innings with no hits allowed and four strikeouts to earn his first major league save. It was the longest hitless World Series relief outing since Ron Taylor's four innings in Game 4 of the 1964 Series, and tied Ken Clay for the longest hitless postseason save, first accomplished in the 1978 ALCS.\nGurriel made a racially insensitive gesture in the dugout after his home run. He stretched the sides of his eyes and mouthing the Spanish word \"chinito\", which translates to \"little Chinese Boy\"; Darvish is from Japan. Gurriel apologized, and said that anyone from Asia is called a \"chino\" in Cuba, although he acknowledged knowing that the term was offensive in Japan from having played there. As a result, Rob Manfred, the Commissioner of Baseball, suspended Gurriel for the first five games of the 2018 MLB season without pay, but allowed him to continue playing in the World Series.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown by Houston Texans pass rusher J. J. Watt.\nGame 4.\nThe starting pitchers for Game 4 were Alex Wood for the Dodgers and Charlie Morton for the Astros. Springer homered off Wood in the bottom of the sixth for the first run of the ballgame. It was the only hit Wood allowed in innings pitched in the game. Forsythe drove in Cody Bellinger to tie the game in the top of the seventh. Morton struck out seven and only allowed three hits and one run in 6 innings. \nBellinger then drove in the go-ahead run with a double in the top of the ninth off of Giles and the Dodgers added four more runs on a sacrifice fly by Austin Barnes and a three-run homer by Pederson. Bregman hit a home run off of Jansen in the bottom of the ninth inning, but the Dodgers won the game to even up the series. The Astros had two hits in the game; both were home runs. This was the first game in World Series history where both starting pitchers allowed four or fewer baserunners.\nAfter Game 4, both teams' pitching coaches, Rick Honeycutt for the Dodgers and Brent Strom for the Astros, commented on how the baseball being used for the World Series is slicker than the baseball used during the regular season. Pitchers on both teams noted that this difference has made it more difficult for them to throw their sliders.\nTwo years after this game, when MLB sanctioned the Astros for sign stealing during the 2017 season, Alex Wood said he and Austin Barnes changed signs every ten pitches because the Dodgers had suspected the Astros of sign stealing. Wood later said that the team tried to get Clayton Kershaw, Game 5 starter, to follow the same method, but Kershaw did not think it was necessary and did not want to disrupt his routine.\nGame 5.\nKershaw and Keuchel started Game 5, in a rematch of the opening game of the series. Forsythe singled in two runs off of Keuchel in the first inning to put the Dodgers up early. A third run scored on a throwing error by Gurriel. Barnes singled in the fourth to score Forsythe. Keuchel pitched innings for the Astros, allowing five hits and four runs (three earned). The Astros scored their first run with an RBI double by Correa in the bottom of the fourth inning, followed by a three-run home run by Gurriel to tie the game. Bellinger hit a three-run home run off of Collin McHugh in the top of the fifth to put the Dodgers back on top only for Altuve to hit his own three-run home run in the bottom of the inning off Maeda to tie it back up. Kershaw pitched innings and allowed six runs on four hits and three walks.\nA triple by Bellinger on a line drive that Springer missed on a dive in the seventh inning off of Peacock scored Hernández from first base. In the bottom of the seventh inning, Springer hit a home run off the first pitch he saw off of Morrow, who was pitching for the third consecutive day, to tie the game. Bregman scored on a double by Altuve to put the Astros ahead for the first time in the game, and then Correa hit a two-run home run to extend the lead. Seager doubled in a run in the top of the eighth inning, but McCann hit a home run in the bottom of the inning. That was the 21st home run of the series, tying the record set in the 2002 World Series. Puig broke the record with a two-run home run in the top of the ninth inning. Down to their last strike, Chris Taylor drove in Barnes to tie the game with a single.\nIn the tenth inning, McCann was hit by a pitch to put him on base with two outs. Subsequently, Springer walked on five pitches to move McCann to second base. McCann was then replaced by pinch runner Derek Fisher. \nOn the next pitch, Bregman hit a walk-off single, scoring Fisher with the winning run. The Astros became only the second team to come back twice from three runs down in a World Series game, the other was the Toronto Blue Jays in the 15–14 win during Game 4 of the 1993 World Series. The six game-tying home runs in the series to this point is the most for any World Series on record. This World Series set a new record for most players to hit a home run (14 to date in the World Series). With the teams combining to score 25 runs throughout the game, this was the highest scoring World Series game since the Florida Marlins defeated the Cleveland Indians 14–11 in Game 3 of the 1997 World Series. Game 5 lasted five hours and seventeen minutes, making it the second-longest World Series game in history by time. It has been frequently cited as one of the greatest World Series games of all time.\nThe ceremonial first pitch was thrown by former President George W. Bush, accompanied by his father, George H. W. Bush.\nGame 6.\nGame 6 featured the same starting pitchers as the second game: Verlander and Hill. Springer hit a home run off of Hill in the top of the third for the first run of the night. It was Springer's fourth homer of the series, tied for third all-time in a single series and joining Gene Tenace, in 1972, as the only players with four game-tying or go-ahead home runs in a World Series. Springer also joined Hank Bauer in the 1958 World Series and Barry Bonds in the 2002 World Series with four home runs in a series. The Astros loaded the bases in the fifth inning, but did not score. Hill pitched innings, struck out five and allowed four hits and one run.\nIn the sixth inning, Taylor tied the game with an RBI double and Seager hit a sacrifice fly to give the Dodgers the lead. Verlander pitched six innings with nine strikeouts and only three hits allowed. Pederson hit a home run in the bottom of the seventh inning and Jansen pitched two scoreless innings for the save, forcing a winner-take-all game seven. Pederson tied a World Series record with his fifth consecutive game with an extra base hit. Andre Ethier, who appeared in the game as a pinch hitter, set a new Dodgers franchise record with his 50th career postseason game.\nGame 7.\nThis was the first World Series Game 7 to be played at Dodger Stadium (and the first Game 7 of any postseason series at the stadium since the 1988 NLCS, and the Dodgers' first World Series Game 7 since 1965 against the Minnesota Twins). It was also the first time since the 1931 World Series that a Game 7 occurred in a Series with both teams having won at least 100 games during the season. Besides, this was the first time since the 2001 World Series and 2002 World Series that back-to-back Fall Classics had a Game 7.\nThe starting pitchers for this game were the same as in the third game: McCullers and Darvish. Springer doubled to open the game and scored the first run on an error by Bellinger, which allowed Bregman to reach second base. Bregman stole third base and scored on an Altuve groundout. McCann scored the next inning on a groundout by Astros pitcher McCullers. Springer hit a two-run home run, his fifth of the series, tying Reggie Jackson and Chase Utley for most home runs in a single World Series and setting a new record with 29 total bases in any postseason series. As in Game 3, Darvish lasted only innings (tying the shortest outing of his career) and became the third pitcher with two starts of less than two innings in a World Series, and the first since Art Ditmar in the World Series. Morrow relieved Darvish and in the process became only the second pitcher to pitch in all seven games of a single World Series, joining Darold Knowles in the World Series. McCullers lasted only 2 innings himself; he allowed three hits and hit a World Series record four batters. This was the first Game 7 in World Series history where neither starting pitcher got past the third inning.\nThe Dodgers failed to score a run and left eight men on base through five innings. Andre Ethier hit a pinch-hit RBI single that scored Pederson in the sixth inning for the Dodgers' only run. They only had one hit in 13 chances with runners in scoring position in the game. Kershaw pitched four scoreless innings of relief in the game, and in the process, he broke Orel Hershiser's Dodgers postseason record with his 33rd strikeout. Morton pitched four innings of relief to earn the win, as Corey Seager grounded out to José Altuve, who threw to Yuli Gurriel to end the game, with the Astros winning their first championship in franchise history, and ending their 56-year drought. Springer won the World Series MVP Award. With the Astros' win, for the first time since 2002, when the Angels beat the Giants in seven games, a franchise won its first World Series title. It was also the first time since 1972 that an American League team won a World Series Game 7 on the road.\nThe Astros were the first team to beat the three wealthiest teams in the sport –– Red Sox, Yankees, and Dodgers -– in a single postseason.\nAfter Game 7, the trophy presentation, usually taking place in the locker room whenever the visiting team clinches the series, took place on the losing team's field for the first time ever before a small crowd of mostly Astros fans that remained as most Dodgers fans left the stadium. Correa proposed to his girlfriend, 2016 Miss Texas USA winner Daniella Rodríguez, on live television during a postgame interview conducted by Rosenthal. She accepted.\nMore than a month later, a \"Sports Illustrated\" article revealed that the Astros had figured out how Darvish was tipping his pitches: \"Darvish holds the ball at his side when he gets the sign from the catcher. Whether he re-grips or not as he brings the ball into his glove was the tip-off whether he was going to throw a slider/cutter or a fastball.\" This unnamed Astros player said the Astros had known about this going into Game 3 which they also won, but that they had an even better game plan for Game 7. After this revelation, 14-year veteran Chase Utley watched the film and later reported to Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman that Darvish was not giving off any pitch-tipping cues.\nComposite line score.\n2017 World Series (4–3): Houston Astros (AL) beat Los Angeles Dodgers (NL).\nThis was the second straight World Series to end with the same number of runs scored by each team.\nBroadcasting.\nTelevision.\nFox broadcast the series in the United States, with Joe Buck serving as the play-by-play announcer, along with John Smoltz as color commentator and Ken Rosenthal and Tom Verducci as field reporters. For Fox Deportes, Rolando Nichols provided play-by-play while Carlos Álvarez and Edgar Gonzalez provided color commentary.\nKevin Burkhardt hosted the pregame shows, joined by analysts Keith Hernandez, David Ortiz, Alex Rodriguez, and Frank Thomas. Outside the United States, MLB International televised the series, with Matt Vasgersian on play-by-play and Buck Martinez doing color commentary.\nIn September 2017, American Spirit Media removed the signals of their Fox affiliates from DirecTV and U-verse systems. As a result, some DirecTV subscribers in portions of the Southeastern United States (as well as those in the Toledo market) were unable to watch the World Series. This dispute would eventually be resolved in January 2018.\nRatings.\nAccording to Nielsen ratings, this series was the third highest rated since 2005, trailing only the 2009 World Series and the 2016 World Series. For the second straight year, a World Series game, Game 5, beat out \"NBC Sunday Night Football\" in ratings.\nRadio.\nESPN Radio broadcast the series nationally in English, with Dan Shulman providing the play-by-play and Aaron Boone serving as color analyst. Tim Kurkjian and Buster Olney served as reporters for the network, while Marc Kestecher hosted the pre-game and post-game coverage along with analyst Chris Singleton. The ESPN Radio coverage was carried on affiliated stations throughout the United States and Canada, as well as online at ESPN.com and via the ESPN mobile app. Spanish-language coverage was provided by ESPN Deportes Radio, with Eduardo Ortega, Renato Bermúdez, José Francisco Rivera, and Orlando Hernández announcing.\nLocally, both teams' flagship radio stations broadcast the series with their regular announcers. Sportstalk 790 aired the English-language broadcast for the Houston area, with Robert Ford and Steve Sparks calling the games. In Los Angeles, AM 570 LA Sports aired the English-language broadcast, with Charley Steiner and Rick Monday announcing. In Spanish, Univision America 1020 carried the broadcast, with Jaime Jarrín and Jorge Jarrín on the call. In Korean, Radio Korea 1540 aired the series, with Richard Choi and Chong Ho Yim in the booth.\nImpact and aftermath.\nSince 2017, the Astros and Dodgers have consistently boasted the teams with among the most regular season wins in their respective leagues. Every postseason from 2017 onwards has featured both teams, with the Astros winning 52 postseason games since 2017 and the Dodgers winning 40. Furthermore, every World Series from 2017 through 2022 had also featured either the Astros or Dodgers, with the Astros making four appearances and the Dodgers three. The Astros have since won the 2022 World Series, while the Dodgers won in 2020. There have been quite a few chances at a much anticipated re-match between the two clubs in the World Series, especially in the wake of the sign stealing scandal, but as of 2023 this has not occurred.\nIn 2020, ESPN writer Sam Miller ranked the series the 23rd best World Series of all-time (and the fifth best since 2000), noting the prowess of both teams and the intensity of all seven games, but noting the sign stealing scandal has tainted the series, comparing it to the 1919 World Series.\nThe 25 combined home runs is a World Series record that still stands today.\nHouston Astros.\nThis was Houston's first professional sports championship since the Houston Dynamo won the MLS Cup in 2007, and the first in one of the traditional \"Big Four\" American sports leagues since the Houston Rockets won back-to-back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995.\nThe Astros earned $30,420,155.57 from postseason pool money to split among team personnel; each share was worth $438,901.57. The Dodgers received $20,280,103.72, with shares of $259,722.14 The sportsbooks in Nevada lost $11.4 million in November 2017, a record for baseball-related betting.\nThe city of Houston held a parade for the Astros on November 3, 2017, which Mayor Sylvester Turner proclaimed was \"Houston Astros' Day\". Schools in Houston were closed for the day. An estimated 750,000 to one million attended the parade. Springer and Altuve appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" November 13, 2017, issue, with Altuve holding the Commissioner's Trophy and Springer holding a copy of a \"Sports Illustrated\" from 2014 that predicted the Astros would win the 2017 World Series. The Astros' win has been seen as a morale boost for the city of Houston, which 9 weeks earlier had suffered tremendous damage due to Hurricane Harvey. According to Manny Fernandez and Paul Debenedetto of the \"New York Times\", \"Every city wants a World Series victory. Houston, post-Harvey, needed one.\"\nThe 2017 postseason saw the beginning of American League dominance for the Astros. Starting in 2017, the Astros have made it to the American League Championship Series seven consecutive times; this set the record for most consecutive ALCS appearances, and second-most LCS appearances after the 1991-1999 Atlanta Braves. Of these, the Astros have won four out of seven pennants, losing in 2018 against the Boston Red Sox, 2020 against the Tampa Bay Rays, and 2023 against the Texas Rangers, while winning in 2017, 2019, and 2022 against the New York Yankees and 2021 against the Red Sox. They would further lose the 2019 World Series against the Washington Nationals and the 2021 World Series against the Atlanta Braves before winning their second World Series in 2022 against the Philadelphia Phillies. Five players - Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman, Yuli Gurriel, Lance McCullers, Jr. and Justin Verlander - were on both championship teams; furthermore, 2017 Astros pitcher Charlie Morton was on the champion 2021 Braves.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nAfter the season, Yu Darvish became a free agent for the first time in his career, and he chose not to re-sign with the Dodgers, as there was much fan ire against him for his disappointing World Series outings that many felt had cost the Dodgers the title. Darvish signed with the Cubs and continued to struggle with performance and injury in 2018 and early in the season in 2019, before returning to his pre-2017 World Series form for the second half of 2019. He was traded to the San Diego Padres, a division rival of the Dodgers, prior to the 2020 season.\nThe Dodgers would return to the World Series in 2018, where they lost to the Boston Red Sox in five games to become the first team to lose the World Series in consecutive years since the 2010-2011 Texas Rangers. After losing in the 2019 National League Division Series against the Washington Nationals, the Dodgers would finally win their seventh championship in 2020 against the Tampa Bay Rays in the COVID-19 affected season. Though they remain one of baseball's most dominant teams, the Dodgers have not returned to the World Series since then, losing the 2021 NLCS to the Braves, the 2022 NLDS to the Padres, and the 2023 NLDS in a sweep to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Every Dodger team since 2021 has won over 100 games, but they won two combined playoff series from 2021 to 2023, with the 111-win 2022 setting a dubious achievement for most regular season wins to not win even one postseason series. Incidentally, outfielder Joc Pederson, who played for the Dodgers from 2014 to 2020, would win a World Series with the Braves in 2021.\nRelation to Houston Astros sign stealing scandal.\nBefore the 2019 World Series, several Dodgers reached out to Washington Nationals second baseman Brian Dozier and pitcher Daniel Hudson, who had been with Los Angeles the previous year, to warn them that Houston was elaborately stealing signs.\nAfter the 2019 season, former Houston pitcher Mike Fiers alleged that the 2017 Astros used technology to illicitly steal their opponents' signs and relay it to their hitters. This was later confirmed through numerous citizen sleuths, and it showed the Astros used this method throughout the 2017 season, and part of the 2018 season. MLB and the Astros opened an investigation into this sign stealing allegation. MLB found the Astros used technology to cheat during their 2017 season and suspended Hinch and Astros' general manager Jeff Luhnow for one season; the Astros fired Luhnow and Hinch the same day. Alex Cora, who was the Astros bench coach in 2017 and the Red Sox manager from 2018 to 2019, parted ways with the Red Sox after the scandal broke. Carlos Beltran who was hired by the New York Mets who was also part of the 2017 Astros was also fired for his involvement in the cheating scandal before getting the chance to manage the team. Cora would eventually be re-hired back for the season in Boston, while Hinch was named the Tigers manager a few days after the conclusion of their season long suspensions. Besides Beltran, no other Astros players were punished. On November 8, 2020, ex-Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow sued the Astros, alleging that Astros owner Jim Crane and Major League Baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred negotiated penalties for the sign-stealing scandal that enabled the team to paint Luhnow as “the scapegoat for the organization and fire its general manager in order to save more than $22 million in guaranteed salary.”\nLong time baseball writer Buster Olney said \"front-office staffers around baseball cannot remember a circumstance of such widespread and loud player-to-player condemnation.\" Angry comments from players increased when spring training began in February. Many players criticized the Astros, especially after their press conference at the beginning of camp. Many of the condemnations came from members of the Dodgers, who the Astros defeated in the 2017 World Series, and the Yankees, who the Astros defeated in the ALCS in both 2017 and 2019. The Dodgers were the only team to release a statement the week the report was released, only to say that they had been ordered by MLB not to comment on the punishments or \"any wrongdoing during the 2017 World Series.\"\nOn July 29, 2020, Dodgers reliever Joe Kelly was issued an eight-game suspension after throwing at Alex Bregman and Carlos Correa of the Houston Astros and inciting the benches to clear after a strikeout of Correa. This was the first meeting between the Astros and Dodgers since MLB handed down penalties to the Astros for sign-stealing. Kelly's pouty face mocking of Correa complaining about the near hit by pitch became an internet meme.\nBefore the start of the 2023 season, Red Sox's manager Alex Cora, one of the alleged ring leaders in the sign-stealing scandal, personally apologized to 2017 Dodgers Kenley Jansen, Justin Turner, and Kiké Hernandez—all of who were members of Cora's Red Sox by this time. \"I just felt like I wanted to cry at that moment when he said that,\" Jansen told WEEI. \"Because I felt like that was the best season I ever had in my whole career because I dominated the whole year, dominated the playoffs, and the Houston Astros were the only ones who put the ball in play. It’s over with, and you can’t change stuff, but what we can do is appreciate when someone steps up and comes forward and be accountable for what they did.\"\nSponsorship.\nFor the first time, MLB sold presenting sponsorships to all of its postseason series; the internet television service YouTube TV is the first-ever presenting sponsor of the World Series. The series is officially known as the \"2017 World Series Presented by YouTube TV\". This sponsorship includes logo branding in-stadium and on official digital properties, as well as commercial inventory during Fox's telecasts of the games."

It represents the interests of the provincial club volleyball.\nThe MSVA was founded in 2009. It is affiliated to the Sport and Recreation Council of Zimbabwe through the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association. It was formed in 2009 when the then Matabeleland Volleyball Association was divided into three provincial volleyball associations, Bulawayo Volleyball Association, Matabeleland North Volleyball Association and Matabeleland South Volleyball Association. The main motto \"ke motshameko wa rona\" is in SeTswana/SeBirwa language meaning \"it's our game\". Variants of the motto are sometimes used with different languages found in the province, Sotho/Pedi \"moraluko wa rona\", Venda \"ndi zwa hashu\", Tsonga/Shangani \"nthlangu wa hina\", Khalanga \"nzano yedu\".\nExecutive Members.\nThe MSVA executive members are elected into office after every four years in an elective congress whereby affiliated members vote for members of their choice.\nActivity.\nThe MSVA has been active since its formation by organising club volleyball tournaments. Of note is the MSVA League that was created in November 2013 and resumed in 2014. In its tenth season running, the league has featured so far, teams as follows but not all in one season; Izihlobo, JM Nkomo Polytechnic, ZRP Gwanda, ZPCS Gwanda, Gwanda High, Gwanda Gvt, Gwanda Stalioans and Wolves, all from Gwanda town, Jessie Mine and JZ Moyo High School from West Nicholson, Filabusi Pirates, Filabusi Wildones and GSU Cavaliers of Gwanda State University from Filabusi, Plumtree and VJM Spartans from Plumtree, Mzingwane Vipers of Mzingwane High School in Esigodini, Matopo Dolphins from Matopo High School, Beitbridge Eagles from Beitbridge and Colleen Bawn from Colleen Bawn.\nInaugural MSVA League.\nThe inaugural MSVA league (2014 season) was contested by five male teams with the final league standings as follows;\n2015 season.\nIn 2015 the MSVA managed to organize a women's league. A provincial team was organized to participate in the Zimbabwe Volleyball Association Inter Provincial championships, the women team came out second after losing to Harare province in the final.\n2016 season.\nThe 2016 season kick-started in March 2016. There were initially nine men and two women teams participating. Due to lack of travel funds by teams, the league was reduced to four men's teams and no women league. The league was re-branded \"The MSVA Super 4\", composed of Izihlobo, ZRP Gwanda, Jessie Mine and Gwanda Government. However, the league was cancelled with only one match played, Izihlobo beating ZRP Gwanda, 3–1.\n2022 season and onwards.\nThe 2022 MSVA Volleyball League season kickstarted in October after a 2 year layoff due to COVID restrictions. It was participated by 12 men teams and 3 women teams. Beitbridge Eagles were the eventual men's champions, with Wolves and Jessie Mine taking 2nd and 3rd places, respectively. Gwanda High were the women champions, with GSU Cavaliers and Jessie Mine taking 2nd and 3rd places, respectively. The MSVA League has since been participated every year that followed. The defending (2023) men's champions are Beitbridge Eagles."

They currently compete in the Handball Liga Austria.\nHistory.\nBregenz Handball was founded in 1946 at the divisions of SC Schwarz-Weiß Bregenz. The team initially played in the German championships. In the 1995/1996 season, the team switched from the German championship to the Austrian championship. After two years in the 2nd league, in the 1996/1997 season, it was promoted to the first division with a championship title. After the handball division of SC Schwarz-Weiß Bregenz operated as an independent club for several years, the parent association was effectively separated in 1996. The growing importance of the club allowed different companies to become involved as main and name sponsors, so the club name changed often (Casino Zima Alno Bregenz, PTA Bregenz, Post Bregenz, jet2web Bregenz, A1 Bregenz). It was only in the 2012/2013 season that the club management decided that the main sponsor no longer had any influence on the name of the club. The team won the Austrian Cup in 2000. A year later, the first league title in the club's history followed. The team won the Austrian championship 9 times in total (the Austrian record) and the Austrian cup 5 times."

Four of the qualification places were won by Namibia, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Spain who booked their places by reaching the semi-finals of one qualifying event in Sicily. Latvia won their place by beating Russia in the final of a mini-tournament staged in Moscow to decide who would replace the USSR, which had broken up since its invite to the world cup.\nThe invited participants were Argentina, Australia, Canada, England, Fiji, France, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, New Zealand, Romania, Scotland, Tonga, South Africa, South Korea, USA, Wales and Western Samoa.\nSicily (1992).\nSeventeen nations came to Catania, Sicily, in May 1992 (from 29th to 31st) to battle for four qualifying spots in the finals in 1993. They were divided into three groups, five in one and six in the other two. Taiwan, Namibia, Spain and Hong Kong were the successful qualifiers after three group stages and three knockout rounds. The affair was complicated and confused. The group stages produced a situation where, by the transition from the second to the third groups, the lower ranked teams were better off losing to one another in order to face weaker opposition in stage 3. Also, the two teams with the best records leading into the quarter-finals, Namibia (played 8 won 8) and Zimbabwe (played 9 won 7, drawn 1, lost 1) ended up playing each other. Meanwhile, a Czechoslovakian side that had won just one match made it to the quarterfinals at the expense of Tunisia that had won 5 of 9.\nDetermination of Pool Winners:\nAll matches in the tournament carry the following points A Win 3 points, A Draw 2 points, A Loss 1 point. The team with the greatest number of points at the end of preliminary rounds would declared the winner. if teams at this stage are level on points then the winner shall be: (a) the winner of the match in which tied teams played. (b) the team that scored the most tries throughout the Round . (c) the team which has conceded the fewest tries throughout the Round. (d) the total points scored by each team in all matches in the Round shall be divided by total points scored against each team and the team with the higher quotient shall be the winner. Teams eliminated on either group stage participated in the Etna Cup mini-tournament alongside an invitational Sicily side.\nThe original groups were as follows:\nGroup stage 1.\nPool A\nPool B\nPool C\nGroup stage 2.\nPool D\nPool E\nPool F\nPool G\nGroup stage 3.\nNo team was eliminated from stage 2, just rearranged on new seedings that went into Pools H, I, L and M. These four pools of three teams each meant that each team had to play a further two matches and this process resulted in eight teams given a new seeding for the quarterfinals, with four teams eliminated, to play in the Etna Cup.\nPool H\nPool I\nPool L\nPool M\nEtna Cup.\nRound 1 Etna Cup (30 May 1992)\nRound 2 Etna Cup (31 May 1992)\nQuarter-finals\n won lost\n won lost\n won lost\n 10 - 10 (extra time 14–10)\nSemi-finals\n won lost\n won lost\nFinal\n won lost\nThe Sicilian team were completely fresh and faced opponents who in some cases had played nine draining games. Sicily entered Sunday having played a total of two games. The final was contested by Sicily and Tunisia. Although Tunisia led by 2 points when normal time expired, the Italian referee allowed play to continue until, in the fourteenth minute of the second half, the Sicilians scored.\nFormer USSR representative.\nAlthough the Soviet Union had originally been an invited team, it had subsequently collapsed and the former constituent nations, demanded their own qualifying event. This was held in Moscow where the Latvia team, in their first ever sporting event, overcame Ukraine and Kazakhstan to reach the final where they beat Russia to claim the last place in Edinburgh."

        "title": "2014 Ana Ivanovic tennis season",
        "text": "The 2014 Ana Ivanovic tennis season officially began with the start of the 2014 ASB Classic event in Auckland and ended with the 2014 WTA Finals. Ivanovic entered the season as the number 16th ranked player and wasn't defending champion at any tournament.\nHowever, during the season, Ivanovic reached second Australian Open quarterfinal after reaching final in 2008. In the fourth round she pulled off the biggest surprise by beating world No. 1 Serena Williams, who was clear favourite for the title and snapped Serena's 25 match winning streak all the way. Despite losing in early rounds of other three Grand Slams, Ivanovic had great season marked with the most WTA match wins of all players at 59 (officially 58, because WTA doesn't count matches in Fed Cup which are in lower round than World Group II, and Ivanovic won one match against Simona Halep in World Group II Play-offs), winning four titles and finishing the year as number five, her third top 10 season and first since 2008. It was the first time that she won 4 titles in a season and never won more matches in a season than this season. She also had 10 wins over top 10 ranked opponents during the season, the most she had after 2007 when she had 14 wins.\nYear in details.\nAustralian Open series.\nASB Classic.\nIvanovic started season playing in Auckland, ranked 16th and was seeded 2nd there. She rolled to her first final on outdoor courts since 2009 Indian Wells Masters, beating Alison Riske, Johanna Larsson, Kurumi Nara and Kirsten Flipkens all in straight sets. Ivanovic was on course for one more easy win when she was 6–2, 5–3 up against former No. 1 Venus Williams in final, but Venus then won four straight games to equal result. Ivanovic broke soon in third set, and closed out later third set with 6–4. This was her first title on outdoor courts since winning 2008 French Open, as all of her four titles in the span came in season-ending series on indoor hardcourts, and it was her first title since 2011 overall.\nAustralian Open.\nComing to Australian Open with first title since 2011, Ivanovic looked as she brought good momentum from the first moment on. She was seeded 14th and was set in line for a clash with world No. 1 Serena Williams in fourth round, tough some though opponents were standing between that match. Against not high-ranked opponent Kiki Bertens at 93, but future Slam semifinalist, Ivanovic had though battle before eventually winning, as she broke in both sets when returning at 5–4. Next opponent was German Annika Beck, and despite of her much better rank placement than Bertens, Ivanovic lost just three games and it could be even easier as she was serving at 6–1, 5–0 but lost next two games.\nIn third round she played against 17th seed Samantha Stosur, who doesn't have much success at her home soil, but is always dangerous opponent as a former US Open champion. Stosur was even positive in their matches at 4–3. Ivanovic started badly, but from 3–5 and set point for Stosur, when line judges called double fault and Ivanovic had successful challenge, she continued a lot better, and despite losing eventually that set in a tiebreak, she lost just six games in next two sets.\nShe then set expected clash with Serena, who was on a roll with 25 match winning streak dating from August 2014. Ivanovic started better, breaking in fifth game of a match, but lost next service game at love. A few games later, and Ivanovic's sudden larger amount of unforced errors gifted Serena first set. But as the match continued, she became more and more confident in her service games and also put more pressure on Serena's, and soon she repeated first set, when breaking in fifth game. But this time she saved it in next game, then had a chance for one more break for 5–2, but however broke at even better moment for 6–3 in second set, because she then served first in decider. At 1–0 for Ivanovic in third set, she broke one more time at love, winning all four points with stunning returns. Players held their service games to the end of the match, which meant that Ivanovic eventually won, 4–6, 6–3, 6–3. It was the biggest surprise of the tournament, especially because of Serena's 4–0 record against Ivanovic before the match, and of course because of her great form, which allowed her opponents to beat her just 4 times in 2013.\nHowever, despite that big win against Serena, Ivanovic looked already in next round as she had much more pressure of eventually winning title, and she succumbed to all of that when she lost to 30th seed Eugenie Bouchard in quarterfinals, though she was better in first set and won it, but from that moment Bouchard was leading every moment, breaking always first and eventually winning, 5–7, 7–5, 6–2. But in addition to her pressure, double fault on a set point for Bouchard in second set says much itself. Despite heartbreaking loss, especially because of chance for winning title as there was no more Serena and Maria Sharapova in the draw, she had great tournament for the Slam, as it was her first Aussie quarterfinal since reaching final in 2008, and just second Slam quarterfinal overall since winning title at 2008 French Open.\nMiddle East Series.\nQatar Total Open.\nAt Qatar Total Open, she followed hard loss at Australian Open with first early exit of a season, as she lost in second round to Klára Zakopalová in three sets, after Daniela Hantuchová had retired in first round when Ivanovic rebounded from nearly lost first set.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nIvanovic was ranked 12th when Dubai Tennis Championships started, but wasn't seeded because nearly all top players came. That caused a clash in the first round against #8 Angelique Kerber. After losing the first set, she found a way to return, and in the end there was a lot of drama, as Ivanovic missed 3 match points on Kerber's serve at 6–5, and then from 5–2 in tiebreak for Ivanovic, Kerber took back both minibreaks, and then had match point herself. But Ivanovic won even three points in a row, and won 3–6, 6–3, 7–6(8–6). In next round she lost to wildcard Venus Williams, player whom she beat just a month ago in Auckland final, winning now just three games, which turned out to be the worst defeat of a season in terms of games won.\nSpring hard court season.\nBNP Paribas Open.\nAfter receiving a bye in the first round of the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells as the 11th seed, she won against Elina Svitolina in three sets, coming back two times when Svitolina served for match in the third set, eventually winning in a tiebreak, tough that serves for the match were just part of players' constant breaks from 3–3 in the final set. In the third round she lost to another rising star, Sloane Stephens, in straight sets.\nSony Open Tennis.\nIn Miami Ivanovic returned a bit from bad results from last three tournaments where she won one match and lost second, as she brushed aside Lauren Davis in second round losing just two games, and Flavia Pennetta, newly crowned Indian Wells champion, in third round. And despite being favorite in the fourth round against Petra Kvitová, she showed once again hot and cold performance, winning first set 6–3, but subsequently losing next two sets with a double bagel.\nMonterrey Open.\nComing to her second International tournament of the year at Monterrey Open, Ivanovic returned to winning ways by winning the second title of the year at same category, defeating Urszula Radwańska, Aleksandra Wozniak, 6th seed Magdaléna Rybáriková, 3rd seed and former No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in semifinals, and Jovana Jakšić in first all-Serbian final.\nClay court season.\nFed Cup.\nFresh off her victory in Monterrey, Ivanovic flew a week later to Bucharest, Romania, for a Fed Cup World Group II Play-offs tie against Romania. Playing in a team without other high-profile players from Serbia, Jelena Janković, who hasn't played Fed Cup since they reached final in 2012, her team wasn't favourite against quite solid Romania's. In first match, she played against Sorana Cîrstea, and Sorana pulled off a big upset, winning in three sets. Playing now as a non-favorite against No. 5 Simona Halep, Ivanovic made upset herself, beating her in straight sets. However, as Bojana Jovanovski lost both her matches, they were relegated to the Europe/Africa Zone – Zonal Group I in 2015, for the first time since 2008.\nThis was Ivanovic's seventh straight year that she competed for Serbia's Fed Cup team, and eight overall.\nPorsche Grand Prix Open.\nPlaying at first clay court tournament in Stuttgart, Ivanovic reached quarterfinals for a second straight year, after two wins against Germans, an easy one over No. 14 Sabine Lisicki and hard-fought against wildcard Julia Görges, rallying from first set blowout where she won just one game. Ivanovic continued to show why is clay her best surface, as she beat two-time Slam champion Svetlana Kuznetsova and former No. 1 and current top 10 player at the moment, compatriot Jelena Janković. Being just one step far from winning blue \"Porsche\" prize, Ivanovic started very strong against two-time defending champion Maria Sharapova, as she cruised to 5–0 lead with three breaks. Despite having 40–30, she lost three games before eventually winning first set with 6–3. Breaking first again in the second set, she was close to a big lead when having a game point on 3–1, but double fault on that point looked as the key for the falldown which followed it, as she won just two more games to Sharapova's 11. If Ivanovic had won it, it would have been the first time in her career that she won back-to-back titles, as she won Monterrey Open previously, but however, these were even Ivanovic's first back-to-back finals.\nMutua Madrid Open.\nIvanovic followed last year semifinals appearance at Mutua Madrid Open with another good one, reaching quarterfinals after comfortable wins over Madison Keys, Bojana Jovanovski and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Average games per set which she lost in that three rounds was 2,66. She fell then to Simona Halep, losing in an hour and winning just four games.\nInternazionali BNL d'Italia.\nContinuing to match good results on clay, Ivanovic repeated her best result in Rome – semifinals. First she beat Italian wildcard Karin Knapp with loss of just two games, before having to battle hard for victory over always dangerous Alizé Cornet. In third round she gave revenge from Stuttgart final loss to #7 Maria Sharapova, cruising past Stuttgart &amp; Madrid champion, 6–1, 6–4. The win was significant for a whole host of reasons, but most significantly she became the first player other than Serena Williams to defeat Sharapova on clay since 2011, ended her winning streak in Rome (Sharapova was 47–3 on the surface and was undefeated in Rome since 2011) and was the only player to beat the Russian on clay that year. It was also the first time since the semifinals at the 2007 French Open that Ivanovic had defeated Sharapova. She then won in quarterfinals against clay court specialist Carla Suárez Navarro in three hard sets. In semifinals defending champion Serena Williams awaited. Despite it looked at the start like her win over Serena at Australian Open was coincidence, as she lost first set 6–1, she rebounded fast and showed that it was far from that, as she broke twice for 4–0 lead in second set, and eventually won it 6–3. However, bad start to the third set gave Serena same advantage in second set, and she won it again with 6–1. At the end of the tournament, Ivanovic was however the only player to take set off Williams.\nFrench Open.\nIvanovic came to French Open as one of the title contenders, mostly because of her recent great form on clay and not because of the rankings, as she was yet hanging one place from coming back to top 10. She was seeded 11th, her highest seed at Grand Slam since 2009 US Open, when she was the same seed. From the first moment she proved wherefore she was in that circle of favourites, as she cruised past promising rising star Caroline Garcia, losing just four games against the local French. She followed that with another straight sets victory against Elina Svitolina, player to whom she nearly lost a few months ago in Indian Wells. Next opponent was 23rd seed Lucie Šafářová. The player who beat Ivanovic five times in a row proved to be disadvantageous for Ivanovic, as she struggled throughout the whole match against the lefty and succeeded to win just three games per both sets.\nIvanovic ended up clay court season without a title, which was unfortunate for her as she would have titles on all three surfaces in a season for the first time, as she later won one title on grass with no problems. She put a solid 13–4 record on clay courts (excluding Fed Cup), the even bigger reason why she should have won a title on clay.\nGrass court season.\nAegon Classic.\nAfter disappointing French Open, Ivanovic came back strong to grass, winning her first grass court title ever at Aegon Classic, as the first seed. She brushed aside Mona Barthel, Lauren Davis, 6th seed Klára Zakopalová, ninth seed Shuai Zhang and Barbora Záhlavová-Strýcová in final. In all matches, she lost five or less games. Win over Strýcová was even more significant as she later reached Wimbledon quarterfinals with some big upsets. This was her first Premier title since 2008 Linz.\nWimbledon Championships.\nQuick work for Premier title on grass at Aegon Classic put Ivanovic again amongst the favourites for Grand Slam title at the Wimbledon Championships. She was again seeded 11th. In the first round, she played against French Open champion Francesca Schiavone and won in two though sets. In the next round, she avenged her 2008 Wimbledon Championships loss to Jie Zheng, as she was shocked then by wildcard Zheng when she was the reigning French Open champion and world No. 1. Now she beat her with few problems, all coming in the first set which she won 6–4, before giving a bagel to Zheng in the second set.\nHowever, on the surface which proved to be her worst through the years, and where she won just her first title this season, grass court specialist and previous year finalist Sabine Lisicki beat her in the next round, giving her another early exit at the Slam, 'early' only because of all she showed throughout the season. Still, Ivanovic lost to the same players just four games in Stuttgart, a few months ago. And also the match showed that Ivanovic was in there all the time, but an early break in the third set turned out to be key as she was giving up over the time the match was closing out. Also, bad conditions played their role in the match, which caused the match to be played over 3 days over the Middle Sunday. First, bad light stopped the match on Saturday when momentum was on Lisicki's side, as she was leading 6–4, 1–1. They continued the match on Monday, and Ivanovic proved to be better one till the rain started, as she won four games and Lisicki one. Rain started to fall on the worst moment for Ivanovic, as she was putting pressure on Sabine's serve, going to deuce a few times before they stopped, and if she won it she would serve first in the third set. When they came back on court after long pause, instead of problems for Lisicki on serve which were before the rain, she blasted two service winners, which were important because she later served first in the decider, and she won eventually 7 of 9 games played in the third part against absent Ivanovic for final score of 6–4, 3–6, 6–1.\nAll of mentioned facts show that Ivanovic played this year with a lot of pressure at Slams opposite to comfort game at other tournaments, which caused two early exit at Slams and also a bad loss at Australian Open quarterfinals, where she played against inexperienced teenager, at the moment, Eugenie Bouchard, when winning was imperative.\nUS Open series.\nBank of the West Classic.\nIn favor of the facts about Ivanovic at the Grand Slams and beside them, soon came a revenge to Lisicki, in her very first match since Wimbledon at Bank of the West Classic, when she won in straight sets. In the next round she lost against Canadian teenager Carol Zhao, losing just two games. In first quarterfinals at Stanford tournament, she played for the third time in a season a three-set match against Serena Williams. Ivanovic won first set convincingly by losing just two games, but eventually lost.\nDespite losing points, she returned to the world's top 10 for the first time since 2009 French Open as Victoria Azarenka lost more points than Ivanovic. Ironically, it was just Azarenka who replaced Ivanovic then back in 2009 in top 10.\nRogers Cup.\nAt Rogers Cup, tournament where she was the youngest champion at the time, when she won in 2006, she didn't have such a great time, as she didn't follow convincing win over Timea Bacsinszky against CoCo Vandeweghe in second round, where she missed a chance to close the match out in two tiebreak sets, but then lost next 6–4.\nWestern &amp; Southern Open.\nIvanovic rebounded back at Western &amp; Southern Open, where she reached her first final of Premier Mandatory or Premier 5 since 2009 Indian Wells Masters. She won her first two matches easily against Sorana Cîrstea and Christina McHale, revenging Fed Cup loss to Cîrstea all the way. In next round she survived hard three-set match against Svetlana Kuznetsova, similar to their previous in Stuttgart. This time Kuznetsova even had a break in decider at 3–1, but after saving a few more crucial break points for Kuznetsova's double break, Ivanovic won five games in a row to close the match out. In quarterfinals she had better time against Elina Svitolina, losing five games and putting perfect head-to-head record against her at 5–0 and also 3–0 in a season.\nThen in semifinals, Ivanovic was on course for even faster win when she was up 6–2, 4–0, when the match started to get likes of controversial one. When Sharapova was up a break point in that game, Ivanovic hit the line and Sharapova barely returned that ball into part of the net above even end of the doubles court. But as the line judge called out, main judge Felix Torralba immediately corrected it, but said to replay the point. Despite 'she was there' as he said, she hit the ball at the same time they called out and hit it far from Ana's side. Ivanovic even clenched her fist before knowing that they should replay the point, and then insisted that point was hers, but Torralba didn't change the decision. From that moment on Ivanovic looked so distracted and absent, as she hit ball weaker and totally lost her game which brought her massive lead. Despite managing to win one service game which propelled her to a 5–2 lead, it was all of her in the second set, as Sharapova won next five games and a total of 7 games to Ivanovic's 1 since that judge's decision. Ivanovic went to bathroom pause before the third set, and as the pause was getting longer, Sharapova asked the judge whether is she changing wardrobe or she's just on bathroom break. Soon after the third set began, after Ivanovic won first service game, in the middle of Sharapova's service game she started to clutch on herself and hardly walked to her seat ending in tears and then had a timeout – doctors checked they blood pressure to be precise. After that they continued match, and Sharapova then started to scream louder and louder and to scream very loud 'come on' after many points, even after Ivanovic's mistakes. After Sharapova held that game, series of breaks followed, as there was just one hold for both which caused Sharapova to serve for match at 5–4. She saved some break points, and then had two match points, but after missing second, she made two double faults in a row. Ivanovic then saved break point in her game, held it, and won a match on Sharapova's serve on second match point for 6–2, 5–7, 7–5 result. Epic match lasted 2 hours and 46 minutes, and Ivanovic was slightly better in nearly all categories, finishing match with 29 winners to 28, and 45 unforced errors to 51.\nIn the biggest final in five years, Ivanovic started good with break in the first game against Serena Williams, which she followed to a 3–1 lead. After missing 3 separated break opportunities for two breaks advantage, she lost 11 of the 13 subsequent games.\nAt the end, Ivanovic didn't win any place at US Open Series as she finished 4th, though she needed just one more win at Rogers Cup which would double her points and propel her to 2nd place.\nUS Open.\nIvanovic came to US Open as the eight seed, her first top 8 or even top 10 seeding at Slam since 2009 French Open where she was the same seed. She lost just three games against Alison Riske in first round but lost to Karolína Plíšková in the second round in straight sets.\nIvanovic showed for the third straight Slam how nerves can distract player at big stage, and this time she even lost to a player who never before reached third round at Slam.\nAsian hard court swing.\nToray Pan Pacific Open.\nIvanovic returned to confidence again, beating four top players to win fourth title of the season. After receiving first round bye, she beat Victoria Azarenka, Lucie Šafářová (revenging French Open defeat and ending 5 straight matches win streak for Lucie in their matches), and two top ten players, Angelique Kerber who was top seed, and Caroline Wozniacki, second seed and reigning US Open finalist. She didn't drop set all tournament. By reaching final, she set personal best for most finals in a season with six, and by winning title for most titles in a season with four.\nWuhan Open.\nHaving to play the day after winning Tokyo title in Wuhan, Ivanovic fell to fatigue and was forced to retired in second set against Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova.\nChina Open.\nAfter enough time to rest, Ivanovic came charged to Premier Mandatory event in Beijing, and moved confidently to quarterfinals after defeating US Open quarterfinalist Belinda Bencic, Romina Oprandi and Sabine Lisicki. There she was given a walkover from Simona Halep. In first Beijing semifinals she lost to Maria Sharapova, shockingly easy, after being bageled in first set and winning consolation four games in second set.\nEuropean indoors and WTA Finals.\nGenerali Ladies Linz.\nIvanovic came to Linz with good memories, as she is two-time champion and one more time finalist. But soon after winning first match against Pauline Parmentier, she withdrew from tournament citing a hip injury.\nWTA Finals.\nIvanovic was drawn into Red Group at WTA Finals along with Serena Williams, Simona Halep and Eugenie Bouchard. First match was against Serena, and she lost for the fourth time in a season to her after her shock win over Serena in Melbourne. Though she lost in two sets, she had one moment in first set to regret when having a break point to serve for the set and missing the ball which Serena couldn't return. In next match she brushed aside Eugenie Bouchard, losing just four games. Ivanovic once again gave a revenge to Grand Slam loss, meaning that she beat all players to whom she lost at Slam ultimately in their next match, excluding Pliskova whom she didn't play against since loss at US Open.\nIn final round robin match against Simona Halep, Ivanovic needed to win in straight sets to reach semifinals, because both Serena and Halep had two wins and would have more sets then Ivanovic if she even wins in three sets. Ivanovic needed just two set win with no matter of score, because even in worst case (two tiebreaks), she would have had better game percentage than Serena. After Halep was close to crashing Ivanovic's hopes by leading 5–2 and serving, Ivanovic managed somehow to get back and won in tiebreak with 9–7. In second set Halep raced to 4–1, Ivanovic won next two games to get break back, but another break for Halep and hold at love definitely crashed her dreams of returning to WTA Finals semifinal for the first time since debut in 2007, though she had just one more appearance in 2008. However, at least Ivanovic managed to finish season with the won match, with score of 7–6(9–7), 3–6, 6–3.\nThis win was Ivanovic's 59th win at WTA Tour, record leading of all players in the season at the end of it, and which ensured Ivanovic finish at the 5th place at the WTA rankings. If she eventually lost the match she would finish at 7th place, giving even bigger importance to Ivanovic's win over Halep. It was Ivanovic's third top 10 finish, along with 2007 and 2008, tough all of that finishes were in the top 5.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nIvanovic's 2014 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nDoubles schedule.\nIvanovic's 2013 doubles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by percentage of wins, as of WTA Tour Championships\""

In 2020, they also finished second in their qualifying group to secure automatic qualification for the finals, and again reached the knockout phase, but lost to Denmark in the round of 16.\n1964.\nWales first entered the European Championship in 1964, when it was still known as the European Nations' Cup, having declined to participate in the 1960 tournament. Three of the 29 teams that entered – Austria, Luxembourg and the Soviet Union – received byes to the round of 16, while the other 26 teams competed in the two-legged preliminary round for the other 13 places. Wales were drawn against Hungary in their first competitive meeting since the group stage of the 1958 FIFA World Cup. The first leg was played in November 1962 and saw Hungary win 3–1 at Népstadion in Budapest; Flórián Albert opened the scoring in the fifth minute, before Terry Medwin equalised for Wales just under a quarter of an hour later, only for goals from Lajos Tichy in the 34th minute and Károly Sándor in the 48th to give Hungary the win. The second leg was played four months later at Ninian Park in Cardiff, and Wales got themselves back into the tie when Cliff Jones converted a penalty midway through the first half; however, Tichy equalised from the penalty spot in the 77th minute and Hungary won the tie 4–2 on aggregate.\n1968.\nThe 1968 tournament, now known as the UEFA European Championship, saw 31 teams enter, divided into eight groups for the qualification process. With all four Home Nations entering for the first time, the already established British Home Championship served as one of the eight qualifying groups, combining the results from the 1966–67 and 1967–68 to determine which of the four would qualify for the quarter-finals. Wales began their campaign against Scotland at Ninian Park on 22 October 1966, but only managed a draw; Ron Davies opened the scoring in the 77th minute, only for Denis Law to equalise in the 86th. Wales then suffered a 5–1 defeat away to England on 16 November 1966; Wyn Davies pulled a goal back for Wales after Geoff Hurst had put England 2–0 up after 34 minutes, but goals from Bobby and Jack Charlton and an own goal by Terry Hennessey gave England the win. Wales' final game of the 1966–67 British Home Championship was away to Northern Ireland on 12 April 1967, but it finished as a 0–0 draw, which meant Wales went into the second half of the qualifying campaign in third place.\nWales began the 1967–68 British Home Championship with another heavy defeat to England on 21 October 1967; Martin Peters opened the scoring in the 34th minute, before late goals from Bobby Charlton and Alan Ball gave England a 3–0 win that left Wales needing to win both of their remaining matches to have a chance of qualifying for the next round. In the second match, away to Scotland on 22 November 1967, Alan Gilzean gave Scotland the lead in the 16th minute before Ron Davies equalised two minutes later. Alan Durban then put Wales in front in the 57th minute, only for Gilzean to pull Scotland level again eight minutes later, before Ronnie McKinnon gave Scotland the win 12 minutes from full-time, confirming Wales' elimination. Wales secured their only win of the campaign in their final match against Northern Ireland on 28 February 1968, when goals in the last 15 minutes of the match from Ronnie Rees and Wyn Davies gave them a 2–0 victory, which also meant they avoided finishing bottom of the group.\n1972.\nAlthough it continued to be played until 1984, the British Home Championship was not used as a qualifying group for UEFA Euro 1972; instead, the four Home Nations were all drawn into different groups. Wales were paired with Romania, Czechoslovakia and Finland in Group 1; it was their first meeting with Romania and Finland, and the first time they had been drawn with Czechoslovakia since qualifying for the 1958 World Cup. Wales' first game was against Romania at Ninian Park on 11 November 1970 and finished as a goalless draw. They then met Czechoslovakia at the Vetch Field in Swansea on 21 April 1971, where they took a 1–0 lead via a Ron Davies penalty early in the second half; however, two goals from Ján Čapkovič and another from Vladimír Táborský in the last 10 minutes gave Czechoslovakia a 3–1 win. Wales then met Finland at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium a month later, where John Toshack's goal in the 54th minute gave them their first win of the campaign.\nToshack scored again in the return fixture at the Vetch Field on 13 October 1971; Alan Durban and Gil Reece also scored to give Wales a 3–0 win and a chance at qualification if they could pick up away wins over Czechoslovakia and Romania in their final two games. However, a 1–0 win for Czechoslovakia in Prague on 27 October put Wales out of contention, and a 2–0 win for Romania in Bucharest on 24 November meant Wales finished the group in third place.\n1976.\nQualifying.\nWales were drawn in Group 2 in qualifying for UEFA Euro 1976, along with Hungary, Austria and Luxembourg; it was the first time they had met Austria or Luxembourg competitively, and their first meeting with Hungary since qualifying for the 1964 European Nations' Cup. Wales began their campaign away to Austria on 4 September 1974 and took the lead through Arfon Griffiths with 10 minutes left in the first half; however, Wilhelm Kreuz and Hans Krankl each scored in the second half to give Austria a 2–1 win. It was Wales' only defeat of their qualifying campaign. Wales responded with consecutive clean sheets against Hungary and Luxembourg; Griffiths and Toshack gave them a 2–0 win over Hungary at Ninian Park on 30 October, before doing so again at the Vetch Field against Luxembourg, where Mike England, Phil Roberts and Terry Yorath also contributed to make the final score 5–0.\nToshack scored his third goal in three games just before half-time in the return match against Hungary on 16 April 1975, before John Mahoney made it 2–0 in the 69th minute, although László Branikovits was able to pull a goal back for Hungary eight minutes later, the first goal Wales had conceded in 266 minutes of qualifying football. Two weeks later, Gil Reece and Leighton James again gave Wales a 2–0 first-half lead away to Luxembourg, only for Paul Philipp to pull a goal back for the home side with a penalty six minutes before half-time; however, James scored with another penalty in the 83rd minute to confirm a 3–1 win for Wales and set up a winner-takes-all match against Austria at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham on the final matchday. Arfon Griffiths scored in the 69th minute to give Wales a 1–0 win and send them through to the quarter-finals.\nQuarter-finals.\nIn the quarter-finals, Wales were drawn against the winners of Group 3, Yugoslavia. In the first leg, they went behind to a goal from Momčilo Vukotić in the opening minute, before Danilo Popivoda made it 2–0 in the 57th. Josip Katalinski then gave Yugoslavia a 1–0 lead with a penalty in the 19th minute of the second leg at Ninian Park to essentially put the tie out of Wales' reach. Ian Evans pulled a goal back in the 38th minute, but with no further goals in the second half, Wales were eliminated.\n1980.\nUEFA Euro 1980 was the first European Championship to feature an eight-team final tournament. With Italy qualifying automatically as hosts, the 31 remaining participating nations were divided into seven groups, with only the winners qualifying for the finals. Wales were drawn into Group 7 with West Germany, Turkey and Malta. Despite being ordered by UEFA to play all their home matches at least from Cardiff due to crowd trouble in the quarter-final against Yugoslavia in 1976, they took an early lead in the group with victories over Malta (7–0) and Turkey (1–0) at the Racecourse Ground in October and November 1978. West Germany could only manage draws away to the same opponents in February and April 1979, and drew level on points with Wales with a 2–0 victory in Wrexham in May 1979. Wales pulled back ahead with a 2–0 win in Malta a month later, but a 5–1 loss to West Germany in October 1979 meant they would have to beat Turkey in their final match to keep their chances of qualification alive, with West Germany yet to play their return fixtures against Turkey and Malta. However, Turkey beat Wales 1–0 to overtake them at the top of the group. With West Germany winning both of their final games, Wales finished the group in third place on six points.\n1984.\nUEFA Euro 1984 followed the same qualification process as the 1980 tournament, with 32 participating teams again divided into seven groups. Wales were seeded in Pot 2 and drawn into Group 4 along with Yugoslavia, Bulgaria and Norway. Home wins over Norway and Bulgaria and draws away to Yugoslavia and Norway put Wales top of the group, a point ahead of Yugoslavia, ahead of the pair's last two matches. Wales lost 1–0 to Bulgaria in their penultimate match, which meant they would need to beat Yugoslavia in Cardiff in December 1983 to guarantee qualification. Robbie James opened the scoring for Wales early in the second half, but Mehmed Baždarević's equaliser with less than 10 minutes to go meant the match finished 1–1. A draw between Yugoslavia and Bulgaria (or a one-goal win for Bulgaria) in the final group match would send Wales to the finals, and the score was 2–2 as the match entered injury time at the end of the second half; however, a header from Ljubomir Radanović gave Yugoslavia the win and sent them to the finals in Wales' place.\n1988.\nQualifying for UEFA Euro 1988 again followed the same process as the last two tournaments, with the 32 participating teams drawn into seven groups, and the winners joining hosts West Germany in the finals. Wales were again seeded in Pot 2, and drawn into Group 6 with Denmark, Czechoslovakia and Finland. As they had done four years earlier, Wales went unbeaten in their first four matches, with draws away to Finland and at home to Czechoslovakia, and home wins over Finland and Denmark; that put them top of the group, ahead of Denmark on goal difference ahead of the two sides' decisive match in Copenhagen in October 1987. Victory for Wales would have sent them to the finals, but Preben Elkjær gave Denmark a 1–0 win, which left Wales needing to beat Czechoslovakia in the final group match to retake top spot; however, goals from Ivo Knoflíček and Michal Bílek gave Czechoslovakia a 2–0 win and Wales finished in third place.\n1992.\nThe same qualification process was followed for a fourth tournament in a row for UEFA Euro 1992, with 34 teams drawn into seven groups, the winners of which would join hosts Sweden in the finals. Wales were seeded in Pot 4 and were drawn into Group 5 with both West and East Germany, Belgium and Luxembourg. Following the German reunification in October 1990, all of East Germany's matches were scratched and the reunified nation continued in place of West Germany, who had won the World Cup earlier in the year. Wales again made a strong start to their qualifying group, with three wins and a draw in their first four matches, including an historic 1–0 win over Germany in Cardiff in June 1991, the only goal scored by Ian Rush. Despite losing 4–1 in the return match against Germany, a 1–0 win over Luxembourg in their final match put Wales on top of the group, three points ahead of Germany, albeit with Germany having two games left to play. That meant if Germany lost to either Belgium or Luxembourg, Wales would qualify for the finals; however, Germany managed to win both matches and finished a point ahead of Wales to qualify.\n1996.\nUEFA Euro 1996 featured an expanded tournament, with 15 teams qualifying for the finals alongside host nation England. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, a record 47 teams participated in qualifying, drawn into eight groups (seven groups of six teams and one of five). The winners of each group qualified automatically, along with the six best runners-up, while the other two would contest a play-off for the remaining place in the finals. Wales were seeded in Pot 2 and drawn into Group 7 with Germany, Bulgaria, Georgia, Albania and Moldova. Wales' qualifying campaign began with a 2–0 win at home to Albania, but consecutive defeats to Moldova, Georgia and both home and away to Bulgaria put Wales second-bottom at the halfway stage, only ahead of Albania by virtue of their victory in the opening match. A surprise draw away to Germany in April 1995 gave Wales a little hope, but they only managed one more win in the group – at home to Moldova in September 1995 – and following home defeats to Georgia and Germany, it was only a draw away to Albania in November 1995 that kept Wales from finishing bottom.\n2000.\nQualifying for UEFA Euro 2000 saw a new record of 49 teams divided into nine groups; with Belgium and the Netherlands qualifying automatically as hosts, the nine group winners and the best runner-up qualified automatically, while the other eight runners-up went into play-offs for the four remaining spots in the finals. Wales were seeded in Pot 4 and drawn into Group 1 along with Italy, Denmark, Switzerland and Belarus. Despite an opening defeat at home to Italy (played at Anfield in Liverpool due to the ongoing construction of the Millennium Stadium), wins away to Denmark and at home to Belarus put Wales in second place going into their fourth match against Switzerland; however, consecutive defeats away to Switzerland and Italy, and at home to Denmark saw Wales drop to fourth place and out of contention to win the group. An away win over Belarus meant finishing as runners-up was still possible with one match left, but Denmark's comeback win over Italy on the penultimate matchday ended that prospect, and defeat to Switzerland in their final match meant Wales finished in fourth place.\n2004.\nThe UEFA Euro 2004 qualification process featured yet another record number of teams, as the 50 participating nations were divided into 10 groups of five teams each; the winners would qualify automatically for the finals in Portugal, while the 10 runners-up would contest two-legged play-offs for the five remaining places. Wales were again seeded in the fourth of the five draw pots, and were assigned to Group 9 with Italy, FR Yugoslavia (renamed Serbia and Montenegro in February 2003), Finland and Azerbaijan. Wales won each of their first four matches, including an historic 2–1 victory at home to Italy in October 2002. Wales picked up just one point from their last four matches – a 1–1 draw at home to Finland – which saw them lose out on winning the group, but it was enough for a runners-up spot and a place in the play-offs.\nThere was no seeding for the play-off draw, which saw Wales paired with Russia, the runners-up of Group 10. Wales managed to hold Russia to a goalless draw in the first leg in Moscow, but a goal from Vadim Evseev gave Russia a 1–0 win in Cardiff, prolonging Wales' wait to qualify for a first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup. It was later revealed that Russia midfielder Yegor Titov had tested positive for the banned substance bromantane after the first leg, for which he had been an unused substitute, and was given a one-year suspension from football. Wales appealed against the result of the second leg, of which Titov played almost an hour, arguing that they should be awarded a 3–0 win because Russia fielded an ineligible player, but their initial case was denied as they were unable to prove Titov was under the influence of bromantane when he played in the match. After their appeal was turned down by both UEFA and the Court of Arbitration for Sport, Wales' bid to reach Euro 2004 came to an end.\n2008.\nUEFA Euro 2008 was co-hosted by Austria and Switzerland, which meant the 50 teams participating in qualifying were split into seven groups (six of seven teams, one of eight), from which the top two teams would qualify for the finals. Wales were seeded in Pot 5 and drawn into Group D with the Czech Republic, Germany, Slovakia, the Republic of Ireland, Cyprus and San Marino. After defeats to the Czech Republic and Slovakia in their first two matches, Wales responded with a 3–1 win at home to Cyprus, only to lose 1–0 to the Republic of Ireland in their next match. A 3–0 win over San Marino and a goalless draw with the Czech Republic, both at home, followed, before a 2–0 home defeat to Germany. In their next game, Wales beat Slovakia 5–2 away from home, their first away win for almost two years and the first time they had scored five goals in an away match for 11 years; however, they were unable to follow it up, losing 3–1 in Cyprus in October 2007. Wales did go unbeaten in their final three matches – beating San Marino 2–1 before draws with the Republic of Ireland (2–2) and Germany (0–0) – but it was not enough for a qualification spot, ultimately finishing in fifth place on 15 points, 12 behind second-placed Germany.\n2012.\nQualifying for UEFA Euro 2012, jointly hosted by Poland and Ukraine, saw the 51 participating nations divided into nine groups (six of six teams and three of five), with the winners of each group and the best runner-up qualifying for the finals automatically, while the eight other runners-up contested play-offs for the four remaining spots. Wales were seeded in Pot 4 and drawn into Group G along with England, Switzerland, Bulgaria and Montenegro. Wales lost each of their first four matches, their first victory coming at home to Montenegro in September 2011. That was the first of three victories they achieved in the group, the other two – at home to Switzerland and away to Bulgaria, their first back-to-back competitive wins for six years – coming after a second defeat to England. Those results meant Wales finished with the same number of wins as second-placed Montenegro, but fewer draws left them three points outside the play-off position.\n2016.\nQualifying.\nIn qualifying for Euro 2016, Wales were placed in the fourth of six seeding pots, along with Montenegro, Armenia, Scotland, Finland, Latvia, Bulgaria, Estonia and Belarus. They were drawn into Group B with Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Belgium, Israel, Cyprus and Andorra.\nWales began their campaign in September 2014 with an away game against Andorra, and went behind to a penalty kick in the sixth minute; however, Gareth Bale equalised midway through the first half before scoring from a free kick with only a minute left in the game to give Wales their first three points. A double-header in Cardiff followed in October 2014; first, a 0–0 draw with Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, followed by a 2–1 win over Cyprus. Goals from David Cotterill and Hal Robson-Kanu gave them the lead, only for Cyprus to pull one back; however, Wales were able to hang on for the win despite Andy King being sent off early in the second half. Another goalless draw came away to Belgium in November 2014, leaving Wales in second place behind Israel – who were yet to drop a point – at the end of the year.\nWales' first game of 2015 saw them travel to the group leaders in March, with Bale setting up Aaron Ramsey before scoring another two goals himself in a 3–0 win to take top spot. On the occasion of his 50th international appearance, Bale then scored his fifth goal of qualifying back in Cardiff in June 2015, giving Wales a 1–0 win over Belgium, who had gone top of the group with victory over Israel in March and were on an unbeaten run stretching back to the 2014 FIFA World Cup. Bale again scored the only goal of the game in Wales' next match away to Cyprus in September 2015, but their first chance to assure qualification was missed at home to Israel, as the visitors' defence neutralised Bale and Simon Church had a goal disallowed for offside in injury time at the end of the game.\nLosing 2–0 away to Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina in October 2015, Wales' first defeat of the campaign, allowed Belgium to move into top spot in the group, but Israel's loss to Cyprus meant Wales had qualified for their first European Championship and their first major tournament since the 1958 World Cup. Despite the defeat, the nation celebrated and a 2–0 win over Andorra three days later, with goals from Ramsey and Bale, was followed by a party atmosphere at the Cardiff City Stadium. Bale finished with seven goals, joint for the sixth most in qualifying.\nFinals.\nSquad.\nWales named an initial squad of 29 players on 9 May 2016 for a training camp in Portugal ahead of travelling to France for the finals; Gareth Bale was left out due to Real Madrid's involvement in the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final. Defender Adam Henley and forward Tom Bradshaw left the camp early due to injuries, before the final squad of 23 was announced on 31 May. Bale was included but was a fitness concern after suffering cramp in the Champions League final, while Joe Ledley was also included less than a month after breaking his leg. There were also issues relating to the fitness of striker Hal Robson-Kanu and midfielder Joe Allen. Adam Matthews, Paul Dummett, Emyr Huws and Wes Burns were cut.\nGroup stage.\nFinishing in second place in their qualifying group meant Wales avoided having to go through a play-off to reach Euro 2016, but due to their UEFA coefficient, they were placed in the fourth and final pot for the finals draw in December 2015, along with Turkey, the Republic of Ireland, Iceland, Albania and Northern Ireland. The draw saw Wales paired with England, Russia and Slovakia in Group B.\nIn their first appearance at a major tournament for 58 years, Wales played their first match of the finals on 11 June 2016, coming up against Slovakia in Bordeaux. Bale opened the scoring with a direct free kick in the 10th minute, and Wales held the lead until 16 minutes into the second half, when Ondrej Duda equalised for the Slovaks; however, Hal Robson-Kanu's goal nine minutes from the end secured the three points for Wales, who went top of the group after the first round of matches. The second game on 16 June saw Wales play England in Lens; again, Bale opened the scoring from a free kick just before half-time, but a goal from Jamie Vardy 10 minutes into the second half and an injury-time winner from Daniel Sturridge saw England move a point ahead of Wales at the top of the group. With places in the round of 16 going not only to the top two in each group but also to the four best third-place finishers, Wales needed only to avoid defeat to Russia in their final group match in Toulouse on 20 June; however, they were not content to settle for just a point, and ultimately ran out as 3–0 winners. Aaron Ramsey opened the scoring with a chip over Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev in the 11th minute, followed by a first international goal for left-back Neil Taylor nine minutes later, before Bale added the third midway through the second half. Combined with England's goalless draw with Slovakia, the result meant Wales finished as group winners, and would play against Northern Ireland in the round of 16.\nKnockout phase.\nAs the winners of Group B, the combination of best third-placed teams meant Wales played against the third-placed team from Group C, Northern Ireland, in the round of 16. The match was played in Paris on 25 June, with Wales winning 1–0 thanks to an own goal from Northern Ireland defender Gareth McAuley as he attempted to clear a low cross from Bale. In the quarter-finals, Wales came up against their opponents from qualifying, Belgium, in Lille on 1 July, and went behind after less than 15 minutes, thanks to a long-range strike from Radja Nainggolan; however, just after the half-hour mark, captain Ashley Williams scored with a header from a Ramsey corner, and 10 minutes into the second half, Robson-Kanu made space in the Belgium penalty area with a Cruyff Turn to beat three defenders before finishing past Thibaut Courtois. Then, with less than five minutes to play, Sam Vokes headed home a cross from Chris Gunter to make it 3–1 to Wales and send them into their first ever semi-final of a major tournament. However, they were unable to get over the last hurdle and reach the final, losing 2–0 to Portugal in Lyon on 6 July, a quick-fire double from Cristiano Ronaldo and Nani proving the difference between the two sides.\nRound of 16\nQuarter-finals\nSemi-finals\n2020.\nQualifying.\nWales' run to the semi-finals of Euro 2016 and subsequent good form meant they were placed in Pot 2 for the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying draw, along with Germany, Iceland, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Ukraine, Denmark, Sweden, Russia, Austria and the Czech Republic. They were drawn into Group E with Croatia, Slovakia, Hungary and Azerbaijan. The top two teams from each of the 10 groups qualified automatically for the finals, while the final four places were decided by play-offs based on the teams' performance in the 2018–19 UEFA Nations League.\nWales had a bye in the first round of matches, due to being in a five-team group, so their first fixture was at home to Slovakia on the second matchday, on 24 March 2019. Five minutes into his first competitive start for Wales, Daniel James scored the only goal of the game to give Wales their first three points of the campaign. They had two away fixtures in June 2019, against Croatia and Hungary. In the first match, on 8 June, James Lawrence diverted a cross from Croatia's Ivan Perišić into his own net, before Perišić put the home side 2–0 up just after half-time; David Brooks pulled a goal back for Wales, but they were unable to find an equaliser. Three days later in Budapest, Máté Pátkai scored the only goal of the game in the 80th minute to give Hungary the victory. In September 2019, Wales again had just one match, at home to Azerbaijan, and they took the lead in the 26th minute through an own goal from Pavel Pashayev. Mahir Emreli equalised for the visitors in the 59th minute, but Gareth Bale gave Wales the win with his first goal of the campaign six minutes from full time.\nOctober's fixtures began with a trip to Trnava to take on Slovakia, where Kieffer Moore gave Wales the lead in the 25th minute with his first international goal, only for Juraj Kucka to salvage a point for the hosts with a goal early in the second half. Three days later, Wales hosted Croatia and went behind to an early goal from Nikola Vlašić; Bale equalised in the third minute of first-half stoppage time, but the second half went goalless and the match finished 1–1. That meant Wales went into the final two matches on eight points, four behind second-placed Hungary, and needing to win both to have a chance of qualifying automatically. The first match was away against Azerbaijan on 16 November, where Wales managed a 2–0 win thanks to Moore and Harry Wilson. A place in the play-offs was already assured, but following Slovakia's 3–1 loss to Croatia, victory at home to Hungary in the final game on November 19 would assure automatic qualification. Making his first international start for just over a year, Aaron Ramsey opened the scoring with less than a quarter of an hour played, before doubling Wales' lead just after half-time. The rest of the game went goalless and Wales won 2–0 to secure qualification for their second consecutive European Championship.\nFinals.\nSquad.\nWales announced on 23 April 2021 that Rob Page would serve as manager for the tournament, after regular manager Ryan Giggs was charged by the Crown Prosecution Service. The team announced a 28-man preliminary squad on 24 May. The final squad was announced on 30 May. James Lawrence withdrew injured and was replaced by Tom Lockyer on 31 May.\nGroup stage.\nAs in 2016, Wales' second-place finish in their qualifying group meant they avoided a play-off to reach Euro 2020; however, their UEFA coefficient meant they were again placed in Pot 4 for the finals draw in November 2019, along with Finland and the four play-off winners. Wales were placed in Group A along with host nation Italy, as well as Switzerland and Turkey.\nWales' schedule saw them given two games in the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, which they made their team base for the tournament. Due to the spread of COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic in March 2020, the tournament was ultimately delayed by a year to June and July 2021. Wales played their first game against Switzerland in Baku on 12 June 2021; Breel Embolo opened the scoring for Switzerland early in the second half, but Kieffer Moore equalised for Wales with a header from a corner with just over 15 minutes to play. Mario Gavranović had the ball in the back of the net for Switzerland late on, but the goal was ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR), in use for the first time at a European Championship, and the match finished 1–1. At the same venue four days later, they took on Turkey, who had lost 3–0 to Italy in the tournament's opening game. Aaron Ramsey gave Wales the lead just before half-time, when he beat the offside trap to collect a lobbed pass from Bale before rolling the ball past goalkeeper Uğurcan Çakır. Bale had a chance to put Wales 2–0 up on the hour mark, when he was fouled in the penalty area, but he shot over the bar from the resulting penalty kick; however, right-back Connor Roberts did make it 2–0 in the fifth minute of injury time at the end of the game, following a short corner routine involving Wilson and Bale.\nThe win put Wales in second place in the group, and their advantage of three points and five goals over third-placed Switzerland meant they could afford a loss to Italy in the third match and still qualify. Italy were unbeaten in their last 29 games ahead of their meeting with Wales and had scored three goals in each of their first two matches at Euro 2020, having never previously done so at a European Championship, and took the lead just over five minutes before half-time, when Matteo Pessina turned home a free kick from Marco Verratti. Wales midfielder Ethan Ampadu was sent off for a foul on Federico Bernardeschi 10 minutes into the second half, but Italy were unable to make the numerical advantage count and the game finished 1–0. Meanwhile, Switzerland only managed a 3–1 win over Turkey, which meant Wales held onto second place in the group despite the defeat.\nKnockout phase.\nAs the runners-up of Group A, Wales were paired with the runners-up of Group B, Denmark, in the round of 16. The match was played in Amsterdam on 26 June; Kasper Dolberg put Denmark 1–0 up in the 27th minute, before doubling their lead just after half-time. Joakim Mæhle scored Denmark's third in the 88th minute, before being fouled by Harry Wilson in the 90th, which resulted in a red card for the Wales midfielder. Martin Braithwaite scored Denmark's fourth in the 94th minute to seal Wales' elimination from the tournament.\nRound of 16\n2024.\nQualifying.\nHaving reached the knockout phase of the last two European Championships, Wales were seeded in pot 2 for the UEFA Euro 2024 qualifying draw, along with France, Austria, the Czech Republic, England, Israel, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Serbia, Scotland and Finland. Wales were drawn into Group D along with Croatia, Armenia, Turkey and Latvia.\nThe qualifying process began in March 2023, when Wales travelled to Split to play Croatia. Andrej Kramarić opened the scoring in the first half-hour, but Croatia were unable to kill the game off, and in the third minute of second-half injury time, Nathan Broadhead scored the equaliser on his Wales debut. Three days later, Wales beat Latvia 1–0 thanks to a goal from Kieffer Moore shortly before half-time. In June 2023, Wales first faced Armenia in Cardiff and took an early lead through Daniel James; however, Lucas Zelarayán volleyed in an equaliser shortly afterwards, before Grant-Leon Ranos headed the visitors in front on the half-hour mark. Ranos gave Armenia a two-goal lead 20 minutes into the second half, but Harry Wilson pulled one back for Wales six minutes later, only for Zelarayán to put Armenia 4–2 up with 15 minutes to go, sealing a surprise victory. Moore was sent off three minutes later for kicking out after grappling with Armenia goalkeeper Ognjen Čančarević, which ruled him out of the game against Turkey on 19 June. Wales suffered another red card in the first half of their game against Turkey, as Joe Morrell was sent off for a high tackle on Ferdi Kadıoğlu. They had had a reprieve in the opening 10 minutes, when Chris Mepham's own goal was ruled out for offside, but in the second half, Turkey's numerical advantage told; although Danny Ward was equal to Hakan Çalhanoğlu's 64th-minute penalty, he could only get a hand to Umut Nayir's opener less than 10 minutes later, and he was powerless to stop Arda Güler's long-range effort that made it 2–0 with 10 minutes to go. That result left Wales second-bottom of the group after four matches with just four points.\nDue to playing in a five-team group, Wales played just one qualifier in September 2023, travelling to Latvia. Armenia's surprise 1–1 draw with Turkey on 8 September meant a win for Wales would pull them to within three points of the automatic qualification spots, and Aaron Ramsey put them 1–0 up with a penalty just before the half-hour mark. Both sides had chances after that, but victory was secured in the sixth minute of second-half injury time, when David Brooks chipped the ball over an onrushing Roberts Ozols. They again had just one qualifier in October, when they hosted Croatia. After going close with a free kick in the first half, Harry Wilson scored twice in the first 15 minutes of the second to open up a comfortable lead. Mario Pašalić pulled one back for Croatia with 15 minutes to go, but Wales held on for the win, putting them into the top two with two games to go. November's double-header saw them travel to Armenia before returning to Cardiff for the final game at home to Turkey. In Yerevan, Zelarayán was again on the scoresheet for Armenia, putting the home side 1–0 up in the opening five minutes. Wales levelled at the end of the first half thanks to an own goal from Nair Tiknizyan following a long throw by Connor Roberts, but they were unable to find a winner, leaving their fate out of their hands going into the final game. As well as needing to beat Turkey, Wales also required Croatia to drop points at home to Armenia. Neco Williams gave Wales a good start, putting them 1–0 up in the seventh minute, but they were unable to take advantage of further chances, and Yusuf Yazıcı's penalty after Ben Davies' push on Kenan Yıldız ultimately consigned Wales to a third-place finish in the group and a place in the play-offs.\nPlay-offs.\nThe draw for the play-offs took place on 23 November 2023. By virtue of their ranking in the 2022–23 UEFA Nations League, Wales were placed into Path A, along with Poland, Estonia, and one of Finland, Israel and Ukraine. Finland were the last team drawn, which meant they were paired with Wales in the Path A semi-final, to be played on 21 March 2024, the winners of which would host the final five days later.\nDavid Brooks opened the scoring for Wales inside three minutes against Finland. Neco Williams doubled their lead with a free kick in the 37th minute, but Teemu Pukki pulled a goal back for the visitors on the stroke of half-time. Brennan Johnson restored Wales's two-goal lead from a corner just after the break, and Daniel James capitalised on a defensive error to round the goalkeeper and complete the scoring in the 86th minute, setting up a final against Poland, who beat Estonia 5–1 in the other semi-final. The final was goalless through 90 minutes, as Ben Davies had a goal ruled out for offside, while Chris Mepham was sent off for a second bookable offence in the 121st minute as the match went to penalties. Both teams were successful with their first four kicks, before Krzysztof Piątek gave Poland a 5–4 lead with their fifth attempt; however, Daniel James saw his kick saved by Wojciech Szczęsny and Wales were eliminated.\nOverall record.\nNotes"

The route entered the Champs-Élysées via the Cours-la-Reine and the Place de la Concorde, heading up the Champs-Élysées and returning down the other side, just before the Arc de Triomphe.\nThe time trial was the first and, so far, only to have ever finished on the Champs-Élysées at the end of a Tour de France.\nLeMond's time trial bike was set up with a 54-tooth chainring on the front and a 12-tooth gear as the fastest on the rear cogset, as well as the triathlon bars he had used in the Stage 5 and Stage 15 time trials, and a rear Mavic disc wheel. Meanwhile, Fignon rode with the same rear gear, but a 55-tooth front ring, no triathlon bars, and with front and rear disc wheels. LeMond used an aerodynamic helmet, whilst Fignon rode without a helmet and wore a long ponytail. Fignon also had a saddle sore and had little sleep the night before.\nWith the weather hot, dry and still, LeMond departed from the starthouse in Versailles at 4:12 p.m. CEST, and Fignon two minutes later. LeMond requested that his support crew did not provide him with his intermediate times, or details of Fignon's progress, so that he could give total concentration to his own ride. By the timecheck, LeMond was 21 seconds up on Fignon, for the stage. LeMond averaged along the course, which was a Tour de France time trial record at the time."

Currently entry is restricted to professionals employed by a Welsh club and those born in Wales or with a parent or grandparent born in Wales. 2016 was the 100th edition of the event and was won by Lydia Hall after a final round 67.\nHistory.\nThe first Championship was held at Radyr Golf Club on 15 July 1904. It was a 36-hole stroke-play event played on a single day. There were 19 entries. Tom Brace led after a 79 in the morning but fell away after an afternoon 92. The winner was the Tenby professional, Arthur Day, who had rounds of 81 and 80 for a total of 161. This put him three strokes ahead of the joint runners-up, 20-year-old George Duncan and Bill Leaver, who had finished 8th in the 1903 Open Championship. The winner received 10 guineas and a gold medal.\nThe 1905 Championship was held at Conwy Golf Club on 23 August 1905. There were 15 entries. The winner also received entry to the final stage of the News of the World Matchplay. The winner was the Llandudno professional Fred Collins on 153. Collins finished two shots ahead of George Duncan. However, Duncan had moved to Timperley and was only trying to qualify for the News of the World Matchplay, not being eligible for the Welsh Championship. Alfred Matthews, the Rhyl professional, was runner-up in the Championship on 160. The News of the World Matchplay had started in 1903 but in the first two years the Welsh professionals had had to play in the Northern or Midland sections qualifying events.\nIn 1971 the event was held as part of the Welsh Professional Open Championship. Don Gammon won the open event with a score of 278, a stroke ahead of Stuart Brown. Two golfers tied for the closed event, Jimmy Buckley and Kim Dabson both scoring 291. Buckley won a sudden-death playoff at the second extra hole.\nWinners.\nSource:"

        "text": "Sun Valley Golf Course is a resort golf complex in the Rocky Mountains of the western United States, located in Sun Valley, Idaho. It consists of three courses totaling 45 holes: Trail Creek, White Clouds, and Elkhorn Golf Club.\nCourses.\nTrail Creek.\nThe resort's primary 18-hole championship course, now known as Trail Creek, straddles that tributary of the Big Wood River, which flows southwest toward the resort and city of Ketchum. Opened as a nine hole course in the resort's first summer of 1937, it was traditionally known as \"Sun Valley Golf Course,\" and expanded to 18 holes in the early 1960s.\nAfter Earl Holding purchased Sun Valley in 1977, the golf course underwent a redesign by Robert Trent Jones Jr. and reopened in 1980. The par-72 course plays at from the back tees, with a course rating of 72.9 with a slope rating of 138. The approximate average elevation is above sea level. At its base is the Sun Valley Club, the sizable golf clubhouse for the resort, with a practice facility and an 18-hole putting course.\nThe Ernest Hemingway memorial is west of Trail Creek's eighth tee.\nWhite Clouds.\nThe White Clouds Course opened in 2008, on the former land of the Sun Valley Gun Club. The newest of the courses, the nine-hole layout has impressive views and severe elevation changes over its and is the most difficult, with a course rating of 37.5 (75.0 for 18 holes) and a slope of 145. Also designed by Jones, it is named after the White Cloud Mountains in adjacent Custer County.\nElkhorn Golf Club.\nElkhorn Golf Club is south of the other two courses, southeast of Dollar Mountain, and opened for play in 1975. It varied between being a semi-private and private club, then was acquired by the resort in 2011. Elkhorn is a split-design of Robert Trent Jones Senior and Junior; the father contributed the hillier front nine and the son the back, which is laden with water hazards. Also par 72, the tips measure with a rating of 72.7 and slope of 139.\nKillebrew-Thompson Memorial.\nSun Valley hosts the Killebrew-Thompson Memorial (KTM) golf tournament each August to help fund cancer research. Launched in 1977 by baseball hall of famer Harmon Killebrew of Payette and former congressman Ralph Harding, it originally honored Danny Thompson, a teammate of Killebrew's with the Minnesota Twins who continued his major league career after being diagnosed with leukemia, and died at age 29. Notable participants that first year were President Gerald Ford, House Speaker Tip O'Neill, and hall of fame slugger Mickey Mantle. Following Killebrew's death from esophageal cancer in 2011, his name was attached to the event."

        "title": "BeNe League (ice hockey)",
        "text": "The BeNe League () is the highest-level professional ice hockey league in Belgium and the Netherlands from 2015. The league was founded in 2015, following a merger between the Belgian Hockey League and the Dutch Eredivisie and thus became the top tier of the sport in both nations. In terms of league structure, the BeNe League is made up of 11 teams, 6 from the Netherlands and a further 5 from Belgium, and they all play in a single group. The league featured a mix of Belgian, Dutch, European and overseas players.\nOverview.\nThe BeNe League is made up of 11 teams, 6 based in the Netherlands and 5 based in Belgium. In the first season, the league comprised 16 teams (10 from the Netherlands and 6 from Belgium). These 16 teams were split into two groups, each containing 5 Dutch teams and 3 Belgian teams. Each team played a total of 22 games over the course of the regular season, they played each team in their division twice, as well as once against every team in the other division. Points are awarded in the following fashion, 3 points for a win, 2 for a win in overtime and 1 for an overtime loss.\nAt the end of the regular season, the top 4 teams from each division qualified for the playoffs. The playoff quarterfinals were played over two legs, whilst the semi-finals and final were both played as a best of three series. The winner of the playoffs was then crowned the league victor. On top of this, the league also crowns National Champions from each country. The team that advances the furthest through the playoffs from each country is subsequently crowned as National Champion.\nOne of the Netherlands most successful ice hockey teams, the Tilburg Trappers, announced that they would not be a part of the BeNe League, and would instead join the Oberliga, the 3rd tier of ice hockey in Germany. They do however, operate a developmental team in the BeNe League in the form of Tilburg Trappers II.\nHistory.\nFollowing the 2009 season of the Belgian Hockey League, HYC Herentals and White Caps Turnhout decided to the join the Eredivisie, whilst the remaining 3 teams dropped down a division and played instead in the Belgian National League. This resulted in the North Sea Cup being played in place of both the Belgian Hockey League and the Eredivisie. Following the culmination of the 2011–12 season, in which White Caps Turnhout dropped out midway through the season, followed by the Leuven Chiefs also stating they would be leaving the competition, it was announced that the Eredivisie would once again take place, and that HYC Herentals would participate. A reformed Belgian Hockey League, featuring both Leuven Chiefs, White Caps Turnhout, and former Belgian National League teams would also take place.\nThe Geleen Eaters released a statement via their website stating they were unsure if they would be able to compete in the 2014/15 Eredivisie due to lack of funding, which is an issue that also occurred the previous year. On August 26, 2014, Geleen stated that in order to participate in the upcoming season they would have to raise somewhere in the region of €60,000.\nThis was soon followed by an announcement that the Dordrecht Lions would be dropping down to the Eerst Divisie, and it was subsequently reported in September 2014 that the Eredivisie was in a state of Crisis due to the fact that the league was reduced to five participants. Furthermore, one of those five teams, Eindhoven Kemphanen, declared that they had no interest playing in a five team league, which potentially reduced the Eredivisie down to four teams for the 2014/15 season.\nEindhoven Kemphanen subsequently agreed to play in a 5 team league, which also featured Geleen Eaters, HYC Herentals, Heerenveen Flyers and Tilburg Trappers, and as a result the Eredivisie went ahead.\nFollowing the difficulties both leagues had suffered in the recent years, the hockey federations of both nations worked in partnership, and on 12 June 2015, it was announced that the Belgian Hockey League and the Eredivisie would merge in to the BeNe League.\nOn 13 March 2016, it was announced that GIJS Groningen would be joining the BeNe League from the Eerst Divisie bringing the number of teams up to 17. It was subsequently announced on 16 June 2016 that the Dordrecht Lions would not be playing in the BeNe League for the upcoming season, instead dropping down a division to the Eerst Divisie. This means that the 2016–17 edition of the BeNe League is projected to stay at 16 teams.\nSeason format.\nIn the main round, all 13 teams play a double round competition in the regular season. With this, each team will play 24 games.\nThe top eight participants from the main round qualify for the play-offs. Playoff quarterfinals and semi-finals will be played as best of three series whilst the final will be played as a best of five series with the winner being crowned as BeNe League Champion.\nTeams.\n(2019./20.):\nPlayers.\nThe BeNe League relies heavily on Belgian and Dutch native players, and as a result the majority of players on the Belgian and Dutch national teams ply their trade in the BeNe League.\nOverseas players (termed \"imports\") are allowed in the league however, with each team being able to sign two imports. An import is defined as any player who is not eligible to play for either the Belgian or Dutch national teams."

        "title": "New Zealand at the 2008 Rugby League World Cup",
        "text": "The 2008 New Zealand rugby league tour of Australia was a tour by the New Zealand national rugby league team to compete at the 2008 Rugby League World Cup. New Zealand came second in Group A of the tournament before winning their semi-finals against England and defeating Australia 34–20 in the final to win the World Cup for the first time.\nBackground.\nAlongside Australia and France, New Zealand had competed at all twelve previous World Cups. New Zealand finished runner up in 1988 and 2000.\nThe thirteenth World Cup was scheduled to be held in Australia in 2004, however the lack of international success by Great Britain and New Zealand after the 2000 World Cup and the rise of the Tri-Nations tournament meant that it was delayed for a further four years. The Rugby League International Federation officially announced this tournament on 6 May 2006, with further details on scheduling and dates following on 19 April 2007.\nAfter the 2000 tournament, international football had focused on three Tri-Nations tournaments held between 2004 and 2006. New Zealand won the 2005 tournament but finished third in 2004 and second in 2006. New Zealand also lost 0–3 to Great Britain during the 2007 All Golds Tour and had not defeated Australia since the 2005 Tri-Nations tournament.\nNew Zealand was granted automatic entry into the World Cup.\nBuild up.\nFollowing the losses on the 2007 All Golds Tour Gary Kemble was fired as the New Zealand head coach, with Roy Asotasi and David Kidwell leading a public campaign to replace him. Kemble was replaced by Stephen Kearney as head coach and Wayne Bennett as assistant coach.\nIn Kearney's first match in charge, the New Zealand Kiwis played the annual ANZAC test against Australia at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 9 May 2008, losing 12–28. New Zealands squad was; Brent Webb (Leeds), Jason Nightingale (St George Illawarra), Setaimata Sa (Sydney Roosters), Iosia Soliola (Sydney Roosters), Sam Perrett (Sydney Roosters), Lance Hohaia (New Zealand), Thomas Leuluai (Wigan), Roy Asotasi (captain - South Sydney), Isaac Luke (South Sydney), Nathan Cayless (Parramatta), Sonny Bill Williams (Canterbury), Simon Mannering (New Zealand Warriors) and David Fa'alogo (South Sydney). Bench: Jeremy Smith (Melbourne), Dene Halatau (Wests Tigers), Adam Blair (Melbourne) and Frank Pritchard (Penrith).\nDuring the 2008 NRL season, Sonny Bill Williams left the Canterbury Bulldogs and joined a French rugby union side, becoming unavailable for the Kiwis at the World Cup. Despite this, he was still named in the Kiwis training squad.\nSquad.\nTraining squad.\nNew Zealand selectors named 47 NRL players and two from the Super League in a 49-man training squad.\nFraser Anderson, Roy Asotasi, Adam Blair, Nathan Cayless, Rangi Chase, Anthony Cherrington, Greg Eastwood, David Fa'alogo, Sonny Fai, Nathan Fien, Dene Halatau, Bronson Harrison, Weller Hauraki, Lance Hohaia, Krisnan Inu, Masada Iosefa, Shaun Kenny-Dowall, David Kidwell, Thomas Leuluai, Jeff Lima, Issac Luke, Simon Mannering, Sika Manu, Manase Manuokafoa, Benji Marshall, Steve Matai, Ben Matulino, Fui Fui Moimoi, Jason Nightingale, Eddie Paea, Sam Perrett, Frank Pritchard, Sam Rapira, Ben Roberts, Jerome Ropati, Setaimata Sa, Jeremy Smith, Iosia Soliola, Chase Stanley, Fetuli Talanoa, Taulima Tautai, Lee Te Maari, Ben Te'o, Taniela Tuiaki, Evarn Tuimavave, Manu Vatuvei, Cooper Vuna, Brent Webb, Sonny Bill Williams.\nFinal squad.\n1 Replaced originally named Iosia Soliola who withdrew due to injury on 21 October.\n2 Replaced originally named Brent Webb and Jeff Lima who withdrew due to injury on 7 October.\nFixtures.\nWarm up matches.\nThe New Zealand national rugby league team played two matches in New Zealand. As the All Golds they played a match against the New Zealand Māori in New Plymouth. They also defeated Tonga in a test match in Auckland.\nWorld Cup Group A.\nAustralia.\nBefore this match an opening ceremony for the tournament was held.&lt;br&gt;\nThe first points of the match came from a penalty kick by Johnathan Thurston (playing despite the murder of his uncle the previous day in a Brisbane park) after New Zealand's Simon Mannering held Brett Stewart down for too long in a tackle at the 9-minute mark. Three minutes later the Kiwis were again penalised in their own territory when Steve Matai's swinging arm struck Paul Gallen in the head, the incident being placed on report. Australia opted to attack New Zealand's line and the first try of the match went to Greg Inglis who beat his opposite number Matai to dive over. Thurston's successful conversion gave the Kangaroos an 8 nil lead. Later as the Kiwis were on the attack, second-rower Sika Manu, playing his debut match for New Zealand, ran an inside line onto a Benji Marshall short ball and found a way through the middle of Australia's defence to touch down near the uprights just on 27 minutes. Matai's conversion brought the margin back to two points. Shortly after however, Australia struck back through debutant winger Joel Monaghan whose try was awarded by the on-field referee after the video official referred the decision back to him. Thurston's conversion gave the Kangaroos a 14 - 6 lead going into the half-time break.\nAustralia were again the first to score in the second half, this time on the right side, with Israel Folau's arm reaching out over one of his tacklers at the goal-line to plant the ball down in the 48th minute. Thurston missed his first kick of the night so the score was 18 - 6. Ten minutes later Brent Tate was being taken from the field with a neck injury just before the Australian halfback Thurston made a break mid-field and, as he was being brought to the ground by a defender, threw the ball back for Billy Slater to regather and score. Thurston then kicked the extras, pushing Australia's lead out to three converted tries with just under a quarter of the match remaining. With less than three minutes of game time left the Kiwis looked to have scored a consolation try when Jerome Ropati crashed over out wide, the decision being put to the video referee. The replay however showed that the Australian fullback, Slater, had slid across in desperation feet-first, knocking the ball from Ropati's grasp with his boot just before he could touch it to the ground. In the final seconds of the match Australia scored one more try when quick hands from Slater flicked the ball out wide for Folau who dived over for his second. Cameron Smith was assigned the conversion from the side-line and was successful, giving the Kangaroos a 30 - 6 victory.\nPapua New Guinea.\nIn the second week of the tournament, Group A's New Zealand and Papua New Guinea faced off at Queensland's Gold Coast. It was the first time the two countries had met since the Kiwis had a 64–0 win over the Kumuls at Palmerston North in 1996. Papua New Guinea made no changes to their side from the previous match, while New Zealand were without Steve Matai who was serving a suspension due to his high tackle on Australia's Paul Gallen in their previous match. This meant Krisnan Inu got his chance to play, and Sika Manu and Dene Halatau were also replaced by Isaac Luke and David Fa'alogo.\nThe first points came in the ninth minute when New Zealand, from fifteen metres out, moved the ball through the hands from the right side of the field out to the left, catching PNG's defence outnumbered so Jermoe Ropati could crossed untouched. Krisnan Inu's conversion attempt missed, leaving the score at 4 nil. Less than four minutes later it was Ropati again who fell over PNG's line, but was held up in goal. In the sixteenth minute the Kiwis again moved the ball out wide through the hands, this time to the right side where Simon Mannering was able to pass untouched between the thinly stretched defence to score. Inu kicked the extras and New Zealand were leading 10 nil. Mannering scored his second try eight minutes later, again on the right side of the field, after taking on the defensive line and breaking through. Inu's conversion was successful, taking New Zealand's lead out to 16 nil with fourteen minutes of the first half remaining. New Zealand's defence then withstood a series of assaults on their line when Papua New Guinea got repeat sets. Back in the Kumuls' half though, the Kiwis scored in the thirty-fourth minute, again on the right wing, when Benji Marshall threw an enormous cut out pass over to Sam Perrett who jogged over unchallenged by PNG's severely outnumbered defence. Inu's conversion made it 22 unanswered points by New Zealand and this would remain the scoreline at the half time break.\nMarshall, New Zealand's key play maker, sat out the second half to ice a tightened hamstring muscle and after seven minutes it was Papua New Guinea who got the first points. On the left side of the field Neville Costigan got a pass out of a tackle to Jessie Joe Parker who also managed to pass from a tackle back inside for winger David Moore to race through some defenders and over the try-line, improving his kicker's field position by putting the ball down behind the uprights. Wilshere's simple conversion made the score 22 - 6. In the fifty-sixth minute, New Zealand returned to their try-scoring ways when Isaac Luke ran from dummy half thirty-seven metres out from Papua New Guinea's line and evaded a few defenders to score. Inu, however, missed the simple conversion. The Kiwis crossed again in the fifty-ninth minute from close range, Fa'alogo receiving a short ball from Fien and barging over the line. Isaac Luke missed the conversion so the score was 30–6 with a quarter of the match remaining. Less than ten minutes later, Adam Blair scored in the same spot, taking a short ball from dummy half Leuluai at close range and crashing over. Inu, making a return to the goal-kicking job, successfully converted the try. In the seventy-first minute, New Zealand were attacking again when Luke kicked high and to the left wing. Inu leapt for it but couldn't catch the ball and it ricocheted off the PNG defence before coming down for Sam Perrett to regather and ground. After examination by the video referee of a possible New Zealand knock on, the try was awarded due to the benefit of the doubt. Inu's conversion attempt was successful, bringing the score to 42–6. The Kiwis got one more try in the match when Greg Eastwood ran the ball from over thirty metres out, stepping and brushing past some defenders to score under the posts. The extras were kicked by Inu, leaving the final score at 48–6.\nThe loss for Papua New Guinea effectively ended their hopes of making the semi-finals, now requiring a win over Australia by an enormous margin to do so.\nEngland.\nThe last time the New Zealand and England sides met was in the semi-final of the 2000 World Cup, with the Kiwis winning 49 to 6. So far in this tournament both sides had defeated Papua New Guinea and lost to Australia. Changes to the New Zealand side were: Jason Nightingale in for Sam Perrett on the right wing; Steve Matai, after serving his one-match suspension, regained his place at right centre from Krisnan Inu; Evarn Tuimivave replaced Nathan Cayless in the front row (with Benji Marshall being named captain); David Fa'alogo was moved from the bench into Setaimata Sa's spot in the second row; Sam Rapira was dropped with David Kidwell and Bronson Harrison added to the bench.\nEngland were the first to score after getting repeat sets which took them down close to New Zealand's line where hooker Mickey Higham pushed through the defence from dummy half in the 4th minute. The simple conversion was kicked by Rob Purdham so the score was 6 nil. Less than 4 minutes later England were working the ball out from their own 10-metre line when they decided to pass out wide to their centre Keith Senior, who beat the defence and raced down along the left wing. He then passed back inside for Rob Burrow running up in support and the diminutive halfback was away for England's second try. Purdham's conversion was successful so England were in front 12 nil with under ten minutes of the match gone. However New Zealand struck back just on 13 minutes after a break made by centre Jerome Ropati from a scrum win mid-field afforded Manu Vatuvei a run at the disorganised defence from within ten metres, the giant winger barging his way over for his first try of the tournament. The conversion attempt by Steve Matai was wide, so the score remained 12 - 4 in favour of England. At the sixteen-minute mark from a scrum win the English , Martin Gleeson made a sudden break from 30 metres out and was into open space, his run good enough for the momentum to drag him and his tackler over the try-line. The video referee awarded the four points and Purdham kicked the extra two so England's lead was pushed out to 18 - 4. In the 20th minute, the Kiwis were down close to the English try-line when New Zealand fullback Lance Hohaia dummied and stepped his way through the defensive line and fought his way through his tacklers to force the ball down, the video referee awarding the try after some deliberation. The kick from Matai missed so the score was 18 - 8 with three quarters of the match still remaining. Six minutes later, England were back deep in New Zealand's territory when Burrow at first-receiver and on the last tackle stepped and dashed through the defence to score his second try of the night. Purdham's conversion put the score at England 24, New Zealand 8. A few minutes later play was halted while Kiwi centre Steve Matai was taken from the field after falling into a tackle awkwardly and injuring his neck. New Zealand, ten metres into England's half and before the first tackle of a new set of six, offloaded from some tackles and kept the ball alive before sending it out to Jason Nightingale on the right wing where he dived over in the corner. Isaac Luke was given the sideline conversion attempt and kicked it, putting New Zealand back in the contest at 24 - 14, with three minutes of the first half remaining. No more points were scored before the break.\nIn the 47th minute, New Zealand were on the attack and were the first to score in the second half when a long pass from Hohaia out to Vatuvei saw him dive over untouched in the left corner for his second try of the match. The video referee awarded the try and Luke's sideline conversion attempt was wide, so the score was New Zealand 18, England 24. The Kiwi's then continued dominating possession and field position and in the 55th minute Vatuvei scored his 3rd, again diving over untouched in the corner after receiving a long ball from Hohaia. Once more Luke had to kick for goal from the sideline and this time was successful so the scores were level at 24 all. In the 69th minute, Luke gained his team a penalty when he was given a push by an England player while running in to contest a bomb and fell to the ground. The Kiwis decided to take the kick from in front of the posts and Luke got the two points which put New Zealand in the lead for the first time at 26 - 24. New Zealand were attacking England's line again in the 75th minute when an English defender fumbled an intercept chance and from the confusion Nathan Fein, who was playing on despite a broken nose, picked up the ball and crashed over. The try was awarded by the video referee and the conversion was kicked by Jeremy Smith, so New Zealand led 32 to 24 with 5 minutes of the match remaining. The Kiwis got one more try, again from Lance Hohaia throwing a long ball out to Manu Vatuvei to cross untouched on the left wing once more, his fourth try for the night. Benji Marshall took the sideline conversion attempt and missed, but the game was already beyond doubt, with New Zealand winning 36 - 24.\nManu Vatuvei's four tries saw him break the record of three previously held by Robbie Paul and Lesley Vainikolo for most tries in a World Cup match by a New Zealand player.\nSemi-final.\nIn a re-play of both sides' last match, New Zealand once again faced England, this time for the right to play in the World Cup final. English coach Tony Smith left it to within an hour of kick-off before naming his team for the match. Kevin Sinfield was dropped from his position on the bench. Ben Westwood was promoted from the bench to the run-on side. For New Zealand Jason Nightingale was replaceed by Sam Perrett. Sika Manu's faster than expected recovery from an eye socket injury saw his return with David Kidwell dropped in his place.\nNo British side had won in Brisbane for 46 years. New Zealand had lost their last 8 international matches in the city.\nThis time when the Kiwis performed their haka, the England side stood in a line ten metres away and faced them.\nIn the ninth minute New Zealand were on the attack courtesy of a mistake from England and got the first try of the match, passing to Sam Perrett on the right wing who crossed out wide, then improved his kicker's position before putting the ball down. Jeremy Smith's conversion was successful so England trailed 6–nil. England, also benefitting from some New Zealand mistakes, were attacking the Kiwis' line and threw the ball out wide to the right wing as well and Ade Gardner dived over in the corner just before the fifteen-minute mark. The video referee showed that Gardner's toe touched the sideline before he grounded the ball so the try was not given. Four minutes later the Kiwis were back down at England's end when Lance Hohaia got over for a close-range try. Smith's kick went wide so the score was 10–nil in favour of New Zealand with a quarter of the match gone. Rob Purdham's restart kick went over the sideline on the full so New Zealand got the ball back and in the following set of six they scored again through Jerome Ropati. Smith's kick was good this time, so the Kiwis had 16 unanswered points. Then in the twenty-ninth minute England had an opportunity in attack down at New Zealand's end and kept the ball alive, the ball going to captain Jamie Peacock who forced his way over from close range. Purdham missed the conversion attempt so the score remained 16–4 in favour of the Kiwis. A New Zealand knock-on less than two minutes from half time saw the English get a scrum a few metres into the opposition's half. In a bold set move from the scrum base, England's loose forward Purdham broke away with the ball and immediately kicked it ahead for Danny Maguire racing through to regather and dive over by the goal posts. The video referee ruled that the chaser was only just in line with the kicker so the try was awarded. Rob Burrow was given the conversion attempt and kicked it, so England were back within a converted try at 16–10 at the half-time break.\nAfter a few minutes of the second half, England second-rower Gareth Ellis was forced from the field with a rib injury. Both sides had attacking opportunities during the first 16 minutes of the half, but it was New Zealand's Bronson Harrison who scored first after receiving a good short ball from halfback Nathan Fien on England's twenty metre line which saw him cut through the defence, step past the fullback and score by the uprights. Smith's conversion meant the score was New Zealand 22, England 10 with twenty-two minutes of the match remaining. After a bomb from England which Hohaia failed to take securely, England were on the attack again. They moved the ball out through the hands to the right, and centre Martin Gleeseon dragged himself through the defence to reach out and score in the sixty-first minute. Burrow kicked the sideline conversion so England were back within a converted try of New Zealand at 22–16. The Kiwis then got repeat sets down near England's line and were the next to score: Fien kicked the ball over towards the goal posts and as it came down in-goal two English defenders failed to secure it and Jerome Ropati was there to fall onto it. Benji Marshall was given the conversion this time and kicked it successfully so the score was 28–16 with ten minutes to go. Three minutes later England gave themselves a glimmer of hope when Maguire found space between New Zealand's defence and ran through it from fifteen metres out to score by the posts. Burrow's conversion meant that England were back within six points with six minutes of the game left to go. However the English were let down by further handling errors and New Zealand were the last to score after England again failed to defend against a bomb out to the left, Marshall putting it down in the corner at the seventy-eighth minute, placing the game beyond doubt. Smith missed the sideline conversion so the final score was 32–22. England then went home with A$130,000 prize money and New Zealand had booked a place in the final the following week.\nFinal.\nAustralia went into the match as clear favorites. They had won 9 of the previous 12 Rugby League world cup's including the last six consecutively. Australia had also not lost since 2006. New Zealand had won the Tri nations in 2005 but had lost to Australia eight times in a row since that victory. The TAB offered odds of more than 20 to one on a Kiwi win by more than 13 points and New Zealand were paying $6.25 to win at many outlets. Suncorp Stadium was sold out months in advance for the final. The captains of both teams, Nathan Cayless and Darren Lockyer, were the only players in this match who had also played in the 2000 Rugby League World Cup Final.\nAustralia took a 10–0 lead after 16 minutes before New Zealand closed the gap to trail 16–12 at half-time.\nThe Kiwis were leading 22–20 with 10 minutes remaining when Lance Hohaia was high tackled by Joel Monaghan as he attempted to gather a cross field kick. A penalty try was awarded and the score became 28–20. Adam Blair then scored to secure the match.\nAftermath.\nFollowing the final, hundreds of New Zealanders welcomed the team home at Auckland Airport.\nThe Kiwis were nominated for team of the year in the Halberg Awards but lost to the gold medal rowing pair of Caroline and Georgina Evers-Swindell\nIn 2010 the New Zealand Rugby League named their under-15s National Competition trophy the Nathan Cayless Cup, in recognition of the only captain to win the World Cup for New Zealand."

        "text": "The 2016 Champion of Champions (officially the 2016 Dafabet Champion of Champions) was a professional non-ranking snooker tournament that took place between 7 and 12 November 2016 at the Ricoh Arena in Coventry, England. It was the fourth staging of the tournament since it was revived in 2013. In the United Kingdom the tournament was broadcast on ITV4.\nNeil Robertson was the defending champion, but he was beaten 2–4 in the Group 1 semi-final by Stuart Bingham.\nPrize fund.\nThe breakdown of prize money for 2016 is shown below:\nPlayers.\nPlayers qualified for the event by winning important tournaments since the previous Champion of Champions. Entry was guaranteed for the defending champion, winners of rankings events and winners of the following non-rankings events: 2016 Masters, 2016 Championship League and 2016 China Championship. Remaining places were then allocated to winners of European Tour events (in the order they were played) and then, if required, to winners of the 2016 Snooker Shoot-Out, 2016 Six-red World Championship and 2016 World Seniors Championship. Ding Junhui was awarded a wildcard for being this year's World Championship runner-up, but later qualified on his own right by winning the Six-red World Championship and 2016 Shanghai Masters.\nWith several players winning more than one tournament, there were fewer than 16 players who qualified by winning tournaments. Remaining places were allocated to the highest ranked player, not already qualified, on the one-year ranking list. After the 2016 International Championship there had only been 14 different winners and, with only one event left, Stuart Bingham, who was 8th in the one-year ranking list, qualified at that stage. The final place was left for the winner of the 2016 China Championship, a non-ranking event. During the China Championship Marco Fu withdrew and Joe Perry, 9th on the one-year ranking list, replaced him. At that stage John Higgins was the only non-qualified player left in the China Championship and, since he was 10th on the one-year ranking list, he therefore became the final qualifier. Moreover, he subsequently went on to win the tournament by beating Ronnie O'Sullivan 10–7 in the final.\nThe following players qualified for the tournament:\nFour players were seeded. The seedings were determined in early October. Defending champion Neil Robertson was the 1st seed, while Mark Selby and Ronnie O'Sullivan were seeded 2nd and 3rd respectively for being the winner of last season's Triple Crown events. As Robertson was seeded twice for winning the UK Championship, Shaun Murphy became the 4th seed for being the highest ranked player not seeded after the 2016 Shanghai Masters."

It was the 30th Final Four of the modern EuroLeague Final Four era (1988–present), and the 32nd time overall that the competition was concluded with a final four format. The Final Four was played at the Sinan Erdem Dome in Istanbul, Turkey, in May 2017. Fenerbahçe won its first EuroLeague title.\nVenue.\nOn September 27, 2016, Euroleague Basketball announced that the Final Four will be held in the Sinan Erdem Dome in Istanbul. It has a seating capacity of 22,500 for concerts, for the sport of basketball and tennis it has a seating capacity of 16,647 people, making it Turkey's largest multi-purpose indoor venue and the third largest in Europe (although it is not the third largest in Europe in capacity for basketball use). The arena is named after Sinan Erdem (1927–2003), who was the President of the Turkish Olympic Committee, from 1989, until his death in 2003.\nThird place game.\nCSKA Moscow won the penultimate game of the tournament, securing third place over Real Madrid and ending the campaign with the best overall record – twenty-six wins and nine defeats. A significant factor to their win was a superior three-point shooting rate. CSKA lead from the start, taking five points before a reply from Real, and ended the first quarter with a 23–10 lead. There was nothing between teams during the second and third quarters, allowing CSKA to maintain their thirteen-point lead into the final quarter. CSKA added to their score and pulled away from Real to finish with a score of 94–70.\nChampionship game.\nFenerbahçe played in its second consecutive championship game, after it lost to CSKA Moscow in 2016. Olympiacos returned to the title game for the first time since 2015.\nThe first two quarters were evenly matched. Fenerbahçe opened the scoring and led by 5–1 before Olympiacos replied with five unanswered points. They relinquished the lead soon after and were unable to regain it for the remainder of the game. Fenerbahçe took an eight-point lead over Olympiacos after the first quarter, with a score of 26–18, though Olympiacos had reduced the deficit to five points, to 39–34, by half time. Fenerbahçe broke away in the third quarter, taking a commanding twelve point lead to go into the fourth quarter 60–48 up. An 11–2 run by Fenerbahçe at the start of the final quarter effectively secured the title for the club. The game ended with a score of 80–64. Fenerbahçe led at each quarter on its way to the title, and head coach Željko Obradović added to his record total of nine EuroLeague championships. Fenerbahçe became the first Turkish club to win the EuroLeague championship.\nBogdan Bogdanović and Nikola Kalinić both scored the most points, with 17 each, while Ekpe Udoh set a EuroLeague championship game record of five blocks. Udoh was also named EuroLeague Final Four MVP."

        "text": "This is a list of television ratings for NBA Finals in the United States, based on Nielsen viewing data. The highest rated and most watched NBA Finals series was the 1998 NBA Finals between the Chicago Bulls and Utah Jazz, which averaged an 18.7 rating / 33 share and 29.04 million viewers on NBC. That series also featured the highest rated and most watched NBA Finals game, as the Sunday night averaged a 22.3 rating / 38 share and 35.89 million viewers. The 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics was the highest rated and most watched NBA Finals series on CBS, averaging a 15.9 rating / 32 share and 24.12 million viewers. Game 7 of the 1988 NBA Finals registered the network's highest rated and most watched NBA game with a 21.2 rating / 37 share.\nThe 2015 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and Cleveland Cavaliers was the highest rated NBA Finals series on ABC averaging an 11.6 rating / 21 share and 19.94 million viewers. The 2017 NBA Finals featuring the same two teams was the most watched NBA Final series on ABC averaging an 11.3 rating / 22 share and 20.38 million viewers. Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals registered the network's highest rated and most watched NBA game with an average 15.8 rating / 29 share and 31.02 million viewers. It was the first basketball game to draw more than 30 million average viewers in 18 years, and only the seventh non-NFL sports telecast (excluding the Olympics) to have done so since 1998.\nThe 2019 NBA Finals between the Golden State Warriors and the Toronto Raptors had a drop in American viewership. Analysts cited the presence of a Canadian team (Canadian viewership does not count towards U.S. Nielsen ratings, leading to only one U.S. home market being reflected in viewership), as a factor in the drop. At the same time, the presence of the Toronto Raptors in the NBA Finals boosted Canadian viewership to record levels.\nFor the 2020 NBA Finals, the ratings dropped to a historic low, with one of the games drawing only 5.9 million viewers. The average viewers figure over 6 games was 7.5 million, which is a 51% decline from the previous year. Some have claimed this was due to the players' political activism; others have claimed this was due to the finals being played out of season caused by the COVID-19 pandemic even though more audience stayed at home, as other sports such as the NHL playoffs and the MLB playoffs also showed a significant decline in ratings.\nGame-by-game breakdown by year (1974–present).\nFigures are expressed as Rating/Share. Rating represents the percentage of US TV households that watched the game, Share represents the percentage of TV sets in use that were tuned to the game. Note that game-by-game viewership for pre-2000 series were generally unavailable."

        "text": "Pablo García Álvarez (June 23, 1923 – December 30, 1997) was a Cuban professional baseball player. Born in Ranchuelo, Villa Clara Province, he batted and threw right handed.\nCareer.\nBasically a line drive hitter with a good bat speed, García also was a smart, aggressive baserunner with decent range, good hands and arm strength at third base and corner outfield spots.\nGarcía played sandlot ball during his childhood, starting to play in the early 1940s in a semi-professional baseball club based in Trinidad, a tiny town in the province of Sancti Spíritus, central Cuba.\nAt 23, García debuted professionally with the legendary Habana BBC of the Cuban Winter League in 1946, playing for them five and a half seasons, before joining the Elefantes de Cienfuegos (1950–1954) and Alacranes del Almendares (1956). In a ten-season career, he posted a batting average of .261 (301-for-1153) with 12 home runs and 135 runs batted in in 388 games. Additionally, he amassed 44 doubles, nine triples, 132 runs scored, and 16 stolen bases.\nIn 1946, García was used sparingly by Habana in his rookie season, appearing in just 13 games while hitting 083 (1-for-12) with one RBI. Late in the year, he will found an opportunity to play regularly with the Navegantes del Magallanes in the Venezuelan Winter League, where he batted .403 (31-for-77) and slugged .523 in 21 games, becoming the first batting average champion in the league's inaugural 1946 season.\nGarcía returned to winter ball in Venezuela during the 1954–1955 season, dividing his playing time between Santa Marta BBC and Magallanes. He hit a combined .350 with 29 runs driven in and slugged .496 in 38 games during the two trips. As the league champion, Magallanes represented Venezuela in the 1955 Caribbean Series. The Venezuelan team finished in second place with a 4-2 record and was responsible for the only defeat suffered by Puerto Rico's champion Cangrejeros de Santurce, a team which featured players as Roberto Clemente, Buster Clarkson, Willie Mays, Bob Thurman, and Series' MVP Don Zimmer. For his part, García led the Magallanes offensive in the tournament, hitting .500 (6-for-12), including one double, a pair of triples, six RBI, three runs and a .917 slugging in part-time duties, while leading the Series in slugging and tying with teammate George Wilson for the most triples.\nIn between, García played nine Minor League Baseball seasons spanning 1947–1956, all of them in the Mexican League, where he performed for the Industriales/Sultanes de Monterrey and the Leones de Yucatán, except for a brief appearance at Triple-A Charleston Senators in 1955.\nHis most productive season came in 1950 with Monterrey, when he hit a career-high .345 (112-for-325) and topped the league with 27 doubles. He also enjoyed a good season in 1951, hitting .320 (103-for-326), while leading the league in doubles (28) and triples (11). Overall, García sported a .306/.417/.446 slash line with 556 runs, 467 RBI, and 114 stolen bases in 778 games.\nA long time resident of Monterrey, Mexico, García retired in 1956 and returned to Cuba three years later. He died in 1997 in his homeland of Ranchuelo, at the age of 74, after suffering a heart attack."

The nature of the tier system means that a draw is needed to allocate two of the three second seed clubs to Tier 1. Exeter Chiefs and Leinster were drawn into Tier 1, meaning the remaining side - Toulon went into Tier 2.

Coming off the turn, Ethiopian born Azerbaijani Hayle Ibrahimov held the curb and lead position. He held off all challenges to the position until reaching the final straightaway, when the crowd of trailers passed him. Spaniard Adel Mechaal was pressuring in the more common outside shoulder position, so Ibrahimov came off the turn a little wide to force Mechaa to run extra distance, but that opened the door for Frenchman Mourad Amdouni to squeeze through on the inside. Behind them German Richard Ringer went wider into lane 2, followed by Norwegian Henrik Ingebrigtsen on the outside of lane 2. Trailing the group down the backstretch, Moroccan born Spaniard Ilias Fifa had just about made up the gap and was catching the back of the lead group as the sprinting began. Ibrahimov was unable to keep up, overstriding Mechaal held the edge over Amdouni, but Ringer and Ingebrigtsen were closing fast on the outside, still trailed by Fifa. Similar to Ibrahimov earlier, Ringer went wide to force Ingebrigtsen to run wider. That opened up a gap for Fifa to squeeze by on the inside of Ringer, outside of his teammate Mechaal. Fifa, Mechaal, Ringer, Ingebrigtsen and Amdouni hit the finish line as a wall, Amdouni clearly the loser but the other four having to be separated by photo finish. It was ruled that the fast closing Fifa won, Mechaal second and Ringer third, all given the same time 13:40.85 accurate to a hundredth of a second. Ingebrigtsen was the odd man out, given a time of 13:40.86. Fifth place Amdouni was only .09 behind the winner. As comparison at these championships, fifth place in the 100 metres was .12 behind the winner (though the first two places did receive the same time in that race too)."

        "title": "The Block (basketball)",
        "text": "The Block was a defensive basketball play that occurred in Game 7 of the 2016 NBA Finals, played between the Cleveland Cavaliers and Golden State Warriors on June 19, 2016, at Oracle Arena in Oakland, California. With less than two minutes remaining in the deciding game of the championship series, Cavaliers forward LeBron James chased down Warriors forward Andre Iguodala and blocked his layup attempt, ensuring the game remained tied. It is considered to be one of James's greatest clutch moments, and his performance across the series—the only time in which a single player has led both teams in points, assists, steals, and blocks—is considered to be one of the best in NBA Finals history.\nThe name echoes a series of bitter disappointments during Cleveland's 52-year championship drought, including The Drive, The Fumble, The Shot, The Catch, The Move, and James's own 2010 televised special, \"The Decision\". Unlike these other events, however, \"The Block\" was in Cleveland's favor, and helped the Cavaliers win the city's first major sports title since 1964.\nGolden State arrived at the NBA Finals as the 1st seed in the Western Conference, having broken the record for most wins ever in a regular season with a 73-9 regular season finish. Cleveland, meanwhile, finished atop the Eastern Conference with a 57–25 regular season record, the third-best in the league. Furthermore, the Warriors initially took a 3–1 series lead, before the Cavaliers managed to win the next two games to arrive at a decisive Game 7. Given these factors, the Cavaliers' victory is considered one of the most exciting in NBA history, and in retrospect, it is considered the biggest upset in NBA history.\nThe game.\nThe first half featured back-and-forth play from the two teams. Neither team was able to build a large lead like the previous six games. The Warriors built a 7-point lead early, but the Cavaliers bounced back to take the lead late in the first quarter. After a second quarter where neither team built a lead larger than 3, Golden State ended the half on an 11–4 run to take a 49–42 lead into the break.\nFive straight points by Klay Thompson early in the third quarter gave the Warriors an 8-point lead at 54–46. Back-to-back 3-point field goals by shooting guard J.R. Smith and a layup by Kyrie Irving briefly tied the game at 54. Warriors' guard Stephen Curry made a layup in transition and a 3-pointer on the following possession to give Golden State a 59–54 lead. Cleveland responded with a 14–2 run — including 10 points from Irving — to take a 68–61 lead with 4 minutes left in the quarter. The Warriors then fired back with a 15–7 run to close out the quarter, taking a 76–75 lead into the final 12 minutes.\nScoring was slow early in the fourth quarter for both teams, but the Cavaliers built an 83–80 lead with 7 minutes left. The Warriors pushed back with a Curry 3, Thompson hitting a jump shot from the left corner, and Draymond Green converting a put-back layup on consecutive possessions to take an 87–83 lead with 5:39 left. LeBron James responded with six straight points, making three consecutive free throws after being fouled on a shot fake, and then connecting on his only 3-pointer of the night with 4:53 to play. After Thompson put in a layup off the glass with 4:39 left to tie the game, Golden State and Cleveland began trading missed chances. At this point, the score in the period was just 14–13 in favor of Cleveland. Both teams were tied at 699 points scored apiece in the series.\nThe Block.\nWith 1:56 to play, Irving released a floater that bounced off the glass and was eventually corralled by Iguodala with the game tied at 89.\nIguodala immediately streaked up the floor as Curry sprinted ahead on the left wing. The only Cavaliers player who appeared to be in position to defend the fast break was Smith, who quickly began back-pedaling towards his own basket. James, standing in the corner in front of the Warriors bench, took off after them. Iguodala passed half court, then threw a chest pass to Curry, who immediately gave it back with a bounce pass. Iguodala gathered the ball and took two steps as he powered past Smith toward the hoop before going airborne. Good defense by Smith on the initial layup attempt forced Iguodala to delay the release of his shot by a few tenths of a second, double-pumping before softly floating the ball up toward the glass. James, who had been trailing the play the entire length of the floor, sized up the shot and sprung at the ball from behind, knocking the potential layup off the glass with 1:50 left. The ball was then rebounded by Smith, and brought back up the floor. This is cited both as a key sequence in deciding the outcome of the game, and as one of the most clutch defensive plays in NBA history. The Warriors would not score another basket for the remainder of the game.\nFinal game moments.\nJames and Curry then traded misses, keeping the score level at 89–89. Irving then hit a three-pointer over Curry with 53 seconds left to give Cleveland the lead. Immediately after Irving's three, the Warriors brought the ball up-court, opting not to call a timeout, and although Golden State got a preferred switch and matchup of Curry on Kevin Love, Love made arguably \"the biggest defensive stop of the entire NBA season\", and forced Curry into a contested 3-pointer, which he missed. James would then go for a dunk, but was fouled by Draymond Green in the process. At the free throw line, he clinched the title for the Cavaliers by making one of two free throws. With the clock at 6.5 seconds, the Cavaliers fouled Green, who subsequently threw the inbound pass to Curry, who pump faked and shot a three-point attempt over Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert. The attempt missed and was rebounded by Marreese Speights of the Warriors, who then missed an attempted three-pointer as time expired.\nReaction to the play.\nAfter the game ended, James remarked to ESPN, \"Iguodala is a bad motherfucker! I had to go chase it down.\"\nJames later recalled to Cleveland.com, \"I was just like do not give up on the play. If you got an opportunity, just try to make this play. I was also thinking like, 'J.R., please don't foul him. I know I'm right there, I can get it, I can get it.' I was like, 'J.R., don't foul him, and Bron, get the ball before it hit the backboard.' And we did that.\"\nMike Breen, who called the Finals for ESPN on ABC, added: \"It's just another example of how he's just not going to let them lose. That was the thought as well after he blocked the shot: This guy is just not going to let this team lose tonight.\"\nBreen described the play thus:\nThe play was referenced by Nicki Minaj in the song Do You Mind by DJ Khaled, which she was featured in later that summer. Minaj raps, \"Any baller tryna score, check them shot clocks/But I hit 'em with them 'Bron Iguodala blocks.\""

The riders then had a descent to the finish line at Lac de Payolle.\nSteve Cummings won the stage with a solo attack. After the first five riders passed, the red inflatable marker collapsed, blocking chasing riders, so the race organisation decided to use the timegaps measured at the mark. Adam Yates was most affected by the collapsing flamme rouge, because he was 7 seconds in front of the other favorites at that moment, and the marker collapsed right in front of him, causing him to crash into it. After the podium ceremony the commissaires revised the result, moving Yates into second place on the General Classification and into the white jersey, which he wore non-stop for the remainder of the 2016 competition.\nStage 8.\nThis mountainous stage departed from Pau, heading south-east, through Lestelle-Bétharram, to Lourdes.

On the descent into Bagnères-de-Luchon he adopted a 'super aero' position, pedalling as he did so reaching a top speed of 90.9 km/h. With 10 km to go Froome opened up a gap of 11 seconds and he maintained the lead to the end, with the following pack finishing 13 seconds behind.

The race had a stage finish in Andorra. The race finished on the Champs-Élysées in Paris on 24 July.\nStage 12.\nThe queen stage of the 2016 Tour, on the French National Day of Bastille Day, this mountain stage departed west out of Montpellier before quickly turning north-east to head through Castries and Sommières.

The finish line was to have been reached at an altitude of after a ascent. After a weather forecast of high winds at the summit of Ventoux, the stage was shortened by the day before. The stage finished at Chalet Reynard at , with approximately of ascent up the mountain.\nAfter the route was shortened, spectators congregated near the new finishing line. Near the end of the race, an attacking group consisting of Chris Froome, Richie Porte, and Bauke Mollema encountered thick crowds along the climb. The crowds forced a motorbike in front of the riders to suddenly stop, causing all three riders to crash. Mollema was able to get back on his bike and quickly ride off, but Porte and Froome were both delayed, especially Froome, whose bike was damaged in the crash. Leaving his bike behind, Froome then decided to run up Mont Ventoux, before being given a neutral service bike. Shortly thereafter he was able to get a team bike from his team car. Froome finished the stage 1 minute and 40 seconds behind Mollema, provisionally ceding the yellow jersey to Adam Yates and being placed in sixth. After the incident was reviewed, a jury granted both Froome and Porte the same time as Mollema, who had finished ahead of the main field despite the crash. This gave Froome the yellow jersey again, and also gave him time on both Yates and Nairo Quintana.\nStage 13.\nThis short stage was an individual time trial on an undulating road, departing north-west and uphill from Bourg-Saint-Andéol.

It served as the final leg of the IAU 50 km Challenge circuit, with runners gaining qualification through performances on one of the nine preceding qualifying races. The winners of the men's and women's trophy were decided by the best aggregate time of their World Trophy race plus their best time from the qualifying round. The race moved away from aggregate scoring, with the World Trophy race becoming a straight final, and it continued in this format up to 2014. The 2008 and 2013 editions were cancelled due to the number of world championships the IAU was already organised that year.\nThe inaugural World Championship event took place in Doha, Qatar in December 2015. This included men's and women's races with individual and team elements. The team titles were decided by the three best combined times set by a nation's runners at the competition. For 2014 to 2017 it was agreed that the competition would be hosted in Doha for those years, moving the competition away from its tradition of changing host each year. The competition signalled commitment to the sport in Qatar, with Doha hosting its first ultramarathon in the months preceding the 2014 championship.\nIt is one of four world championships organised by the IAU, with the others being the IAU 100 km World Championships, IAU 24 Hour World Championship and the IAU Trail Running World Championships.\nThe inaugural edition in 2005 incorporated a European Championship race. Oleg Kharitonov was the men's winner, with World Trophy winner Sandor Barcza as runner-up and Stefano Sartori in third. The European Championship and World Trophy places matched on the women's side, with Heather Foundling-Hawker winner of both. The European Championship was abandoned after the launch of the World Championships. It had only been held twice (Mario Ardemagni and Danielle Sanderson were the 2004 winners)."

        "title": "Trump National Golf Club Westchester",
        "text": "Trump National Golf Club Westchester is a private golf club in Briarcliff Manor, New York. The course has eighteen holes, with a clubhouse. Founded in 1922 as \"Briarcliff Country Club\", it later operated as \"Briar Hills Country Club\" and \"Briar Hall Golf and Country Club.\" Donald Trump, the former president of the United States, purchased the property in 1996 and renamed the club after its county, Westchester, in a similar manner to his other golf properties. He had the clubhouse and course rebuilt for its 2002 reopening; the course was designed by Jim Fazio. Donald Trump served as president over Trump National Golf Club LLC (managing the Westchester club) from August 2000 until January 19, 2017, the day before his inauguration.\nHistory.\nThe club had its origins around 1895, with Briarcliff founder Walter W. Law's private nine-hole course on his estate, which became available to Briarcliff Lodge guests, and was then known as the Briarcliff Golf Club. In 1922, Devereux Emmet designed a course across the street with eighteen holes, and thus Briarcliff Country Club was founded that year. The name was changed in 1927 to avoid confusion, to Briar Hills Country Club. Briar Hills opened in May 1929 with a new clubhouse; construction began in May 1928 and utilized local stones for the building's exterior. The interior was noted for its design and spaciousness. In 1936, A. W. Tillinghast redesigned the course. In 1948, Henry Law's son Theodore sold the club to local businessmen who renamed it Briar Hall Golf and Country Club. The 1964 Metropolitan Open was hosted at Briar Hall; Jack Patroni won the championship. In 1980, ownership of the club changed hands again.\nHenry Law, a son of village founder Walter W. Law, was among Briar Hill's founders. Among the club's directors were Henry Law and his son Theodore Gilman Law; Gene Sarazen was the club's golf professional in 1923–24, followed by 1952 PGA Champion Jim Turnesa.\nTrump's purchase and redevelopment.\nAt the time of Briar Hall's 1996 sale, the club had an 18-hole, golf course and clubhouse, seven tennis courts, an in-ground swimming pool, pro shop, maintenance building, and pool house. Briar Hall had been taken over by the Marine Midland Bank, which then sold the property to Trump. Trump bought Briar Hall Country Club for $7.5 million in the foreclosure in December 1996 and ran the club until 1999, until he closed the property to begin its redevelopment. The first general manager of the club, Chief Operating Officer Carolyn Kepcher, later became co-host on Trump's television show \"The Apprentice\". She was fired from the show and management position in August 2006.\nOn March 16, 1999, Briarcliff was operating its mayoral election, and incumbent mayor Keith Austin ran unopposed. Write-ins supporting lawyer Richard Mattiaccio prompted a conflict involving hundreds of residents, which led to one arrest. The event took place near the polls at the Village Hall; Mattiaccio had gained supporters by criticizing Austin's weak opposition to Trump's club reconstruction plans. Many residents believed a large project would congest streets with construction vehicles and rip up the landscape. In redesigning the club and its course, Trump hired golf course architect Jim Fazio, brother of Tom Fazio in the same profession. Around the same time, the workmen resodded a village soccer field and assisted in constructing a new veterans' memorial in Briarcliff. He also had the current white clapboard and fieldstone clubhouse built on the property. At one time, due to residents' criticism, the clubhouse was reduced to , eliminating guest rooms and special event halls. It was designed by Robert Lamb Hart Planners &amp; Architects, and included three stories with lockers, a 150-seat restaurant, and top-floor lounge. Other difficulties with the club's plans arose; the village planning board recognized villager concerns over golf tournaments, membership requirements, and pesticide use. And at the time of the club's reconstruction, Trump had three other golf clubs planned, including one in Seven Springs, an area within three towns which would require approval from all three, and one in the French Hill section of Yorktown. Trump later dropped all of the plans, calling Westchester County \"the toughest place to build on the planet\".\nReopening and further events.\nThe first head golf professional was Frank Graniero. The club's first nine holes opened on April 15, 2002, followed by the next nine on June 29, 2002. The club had a total cost of $30 million or $40 million, and was claimed to be the largest excavation project in Westchester County's history, with about of earth moved. The thirteenth hole cost Trump $7 million, surrounded by an artificial black granite waterfall, which pumps a minute.\nIn 2003 Trump tried to move the Sybase Classic, a LPGA tournament, from Wykagyl Country Club to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatzky was opposed to the plan; Trump attempted to persuade the mayor to talk to his wife, Jean Chatzky, about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library's then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there. The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or PGA tournament to the club.\nA storm in June 2011 caused public utilities including the Briarcliff library and Law Memorial Park's public pool and playing fields to be flooded. When Trump had renovated the course, his workers made unauthorized changes to its drainage system, which made the course look and play better for golfers. The alterations lowered the system's water capacity and thus raised water levels by about six feet. The Trump Organization met with the village over the issue, though it did not take corrective actions. After negotiations ended, the village billed the club $238,353. The Trump Organization blamed the flooding on a village drainage pipe which lacked a grate, and blamed the conflict on then-Briarcliff mayor William Vescio, who owns a company that previously came into conflict with Trump. Vescio denied the relation to the previous conflict and claimed that the flooding was caused by rocks and trees at washed down the hill from the golf club.\nWhen President Obama was in Westchester in 2014, his staff attempted to schedule visits to local golf clubs including Trump National, none of which wanted to close their courses for the president to play. Trump replied to NBC 4 New York's report of the news with a widely circulated and publicized tweet—\"If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!\" In 2015, the club sued the town of Ossining to lower its worth from $13.5 million to $1.4 million in order to reduce property and school taxes; local residents complained because their own taxes would rise. In 2016, the club revised its claims to $9 million, closer to the 2014 town estimate of $14.3 million. In June 2017, Trump disclosed a value of the club at over $50 million, with $9.7 million in personal income in 2016.\nDaniel Scavino began working at Briar Hall Country Club as a caddie in 1990, while in high school. He was promoted several times, including to general manager of the club after Trump's purchase. After serving as social media director for Trump's presidential campaign, he became Assistant to the President and Director of Social Media in December 2016. Trump's candidacy for the 2016 United States presidential election affected the club; Horace Greeley High School used the facility for its annual proms, which was protested by its students in late 2015 due to its connection to Trump as a political candidate. The location for the 2016 prom has yet to be changed by student decision. In the following year, it was reported that Pleasantville High School's graduating class was considering changing its prom venue from Trump's club as well. The graduating class voted, 97–44, to keep the venue. On June 7, 2016, Trump gave his nomination victory speech at the clubhouse; he had just won the Republican primaries.\nIn July 2016, during Trump's presidential campaign, his opponent Hillary Clinton released a campaign video of one of the club's architects. The architect, Andrew Tesoro, described his dealings with the Trump Organization, where about a dozen employees met him at the finished clubhouse to negotiate reducing his fees. They pressured him into sending a reduced bill, of $50,000 instead of $140,000. After the organization failed to pay the bill, Tesoro met with Trump who convinced him to accept only $25,000 for his services. The Clinton campaign used the story as part of its effort to demonstrate that the Trump Organization harms small businesses. Later during Trump's campaign, in September 2016, \"The Washington Post\" reported that a painting of Trump may be on display at the club. Trump had purchased Michael Israel's work for $200,000 in 2007 through his charity, the Donald J. Trump Foundation. According to IRS regulations, the painting would have to be used for a charitable purpose, or donated to a charity, however Melania Trump had planned to hang it in the club's boardroom or conference room, and the artist later stated he believed it was at the clubhouse. Although the painting was purchased at a charity auction, where half of the Trump Foundation's check went to the charity, in September 2016 an IRS director deemed Trump to have violated IRS rules and President Barack Obama publicly criticized Trump's purchase. The golf club was a topic of discussion in 2019, in a trial against the now-defunct Trump Foundation, where the president admitted the foundation had been used to settle legal obligations of the club.\nCurrent operations.\nIn 2001, annual membership dues were stated to be $9,000 per member or $12,000 for a family, with an initial deposit of $250,000. Before the 2008 recession, initiation fees were $100,000 to $150,000. As of late 2015, initiation fees were down to $50,000. Around that time, many new members were reportedly not charged an initiation fee or were no longer required by the club to fully pay it within five years. Annual dues were $19,400 a year.\nProperty.\nThe club is located on about adjacent to Briarcliff Manor's central business district and in a residential area near Pace University's former Briarcliff campus off Pine Road. The property contains \"The Residences at Trump National Golf Club\", a series of sixteen attached townhouses ranging in size from and which were designed by William Devereaux &amp; Associates. Plans exist for an additional 71 condominiums; the site was approved for 87 home sites in 1987. The club also includes a member restaurant, which serves Kobe beef burgers, tuna flown in daily from Honolulu, and Trump Ice bottled water.\nTax assessments.\nEvery year since 2015, the Trump Organization has challenged the local tax assessment which is based on the property's value. Local entity officials assessed it at $15 million, while the organization put it at $1.4 million. In a compromise agreement in July 2021, the assessed value was reduced by 30%. In October, the district attorney for Westchester County subpoenaed the property-tax records, indicating \"signaling a previously unknown criminal inquiry into the Trump Organization.\" It is very likely to go to trial with the others.\nNotable members.\nIn 2011, notable members included former Yankees manager Joe Torre, and actors Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood. Around 2003, members included Rudy Giuliani, Jack Nicholson, Hugh Grant, George Steinbrenner, and Regis Philbin. Visiting players include Ron Howard, Regis Philbin, and Bobby Bonilla, who came for the course's reopening in 2002, and professional golfer Nick Faldo. Other visitors include Michael Jordan, former New York City mayors Michael Bloomberg and Rudy Giuliani, and Billy Crystal, who joined Trump and members Bill Clinton and Joe Torre for the 2008 Joe Torre Safe at Home Foundation Golf Classic at the club.\nFormer US President Bill Clinton became a member of the club in May 2003. Donald Trump has said that he bought the club partly \"because he knew Bill Clinton would need a place to play\". Part of the Clintons' gift for Bill's 65th birthday was a round of golf at Trump National with Hillary and Chelsea Clinton.\nThe golf club is Eric Trump's home course. He raises about $3 million each year in an event there for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Mariano Rivera, the New York Knicks, and the Rangers also run charity tournaments there. At one time, Donald Trump had scheduled to be there himself at least once a week. Eric Trump and his foundation received scrutiny from the press in June 2017 after it was revealed that the foundation was funneling money to the Trump Organization through its charity tournaments, held at Trump National Golf Club Westchester and other sites. A few days later, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman was reported to be investigating Eric Trump's foundation and its events at the golf course.\nIn popular culture.\nThe club was shown on Trump's show \"The Apprentice\", in season one's two-part finale for Bill Rancic's last challenge and season 10's two-part finale for Clint Robertson's."

        "title": "Sentinels (esports)",
        "text": "Sentinels is an American esports organization based in Los Angeles, California. The organization was founded as the \"League of Legends\" team Phoenix1 and competed in the North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS). In June 2018, Phoenix1 rebranded to Sentinels. The company currently fields teams in \"Valorant\", \"Apex Legends\", and \"Halo\".\nHistory.\nPhoenix1 was founded in May 2016 as a \"League of Legends\" team to compete in the North American League of Legends Championship Series (NA LCS). After the NA LCS became a franchised league, Phoenix1 sold its LCS spot. Following, Phoenix1 partnered with Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment (KSE) to launch their Overwatch League franchised team Los Angeles Gladiators for the video game \"Overwatch\". After successfully launching the \"Overwatch\" team, the company rebranded to Sentinels in June 2018. Sentinels opened two new divisions in 2018; in June 2018, they entered \"Hearthstone\" esports, and the following month, they began their \"Fortnite\" division.\nIn August 2019, Sentinels co-founder and CEO Rob Moore filed a lawsuit against KSE; Moore alleged that KSE purchased the organization Echo Fox without his knowledge. Following the suit, Sentinels split with KSE, leaving the latter as the sole owner of the Gladiators.\nIn February 2020, Sentinels expanded into the competitive \"Halo\" scene. Two months later, they established their \"Valorant\" division.\nDivisions.\n\"Valorant\".\nSentinels began their \"Valorant\" division in April 2020, signing former \"Overwatch\" player Jay \"sinatraa\" Won and former \"\" players Shahzeb \"ShahZaM\" Khan, and Hunter \"SicK\" Mims, as well as bringing in Jared \"zombs\" Gitlin from their \"Apex Legends\" division. In June 2020, they rounded out their roster with the signing of Michael \"dapr\" Gulino. After sinatraa was suspended in 2021, Sentinels acquired Tyson \"TenZ\" Ngo on loan from Cloud9 in March of that year for Valorant Challengers Stage 1 and 2. Sentinels won the first international event in the \"Valorant\" competitive scene, VALORANT Champions Tour 2021: Stage 2 Masters – Reykjavík, without losing any map points. In June 2021, Sentinels fully acquired TenZ from Cloud9, buying out his contract. In September 2021, Sentinels finished 5th–8th place at the Valorant Champions Tour Stage 3: Masters Berlin after a defeat to Team Envy.\nSentinels signed Matt \"Weltis\" Liu as their analyst on July 22, 2022. On September 21, 2022, Sentinels was selected as a partner by Riot Games to compete in the Valorant Champions Tour Americas League for 2023. Sentinels overhauled their entire Valorant roster by letting go of Shahzeb \"ShahZaM\" Khan, Jordan \"Zellsis\" Montemurro, Michael \"shroud\" Grzesiek, and Eric \"Kanpeki\" Xu and replacing them with former XSET players, Zachary \"zekken\" Patrone and in-game leader Rory \"dephh\" Jackson, as well as 2022 Valorant Champions winners Gustavo \"Sacy\" Rossi and Bryan \"pANcada\" Luna. Sentinels also let go of their head coach Shane \"Rawkus\" Flaherty and replaced him with Don \"SyykoNT\" Muir as head coach and Adam \"kaplan\" Kaplan as a strategic coach. On March 13, 2023, Sentinels announced the signing of former OpTic Gaming player Jimmy \"Marved\" Nguyen, as a substitute. On April 17, 2023, SyykoNT announced his departure, promoting kaplan to head coach and Drew \"DrewSpark\" Spark-Whitworth as assistant coach. On May 9, 2023, Tyson \"TenZ\" Ngo returned to the active roster following a wrist injury. Following his return, dephh was let go and later replaced with Marved, who would compete with Sentinels for the remainder of the season as their in-game leader. Sentinels did not qualify for the Americas League playoffs, forcing them to compete in the Americas Last Chance Qualifier for 2023 Valorant Champions — of which they were then eliminated by Leviatán, putting their season to an end.\nOn September 13, 2023, Sentinels announced the signing of in-game leader Mohamed \"johnqt\" Ouarid. One day later, Sentinels re-signed Zellsis, now as their substitute player. Following the signing of Zellsis, Sentinels began a series of multiple off-season events culminating in their participation in the \"AfreecaTV Valorant League\" in Seoul, South Korea where they finished 1st place after beating Paper Rex. This was the last off-season event they participated in ahead of the 2024 season. As of February 9, 2024, Sentinels have moved pANcada to the bench and promoted Zellsis to the starting roster.\nOn March 24, 2024, Sentinels won VALORANT Champions Tour 2024: Masters Madrid by defeating Gen.G in the grand final.\n\"Halo\".\nSentinels entered the \"Halo\" scene in February 2019, signing Halo veterans, previously of TOX Gaming, consisting of Paul \"SnakeBite\" Duarte, Tony \"LethuL\" Campbell Jr., Bradley \"aPG\" Laws, and Mathew \"Royal2\" Fiorante, with Chris \"Royal1\" Fiorante, as their coach. In October 2020, Sentinels announced the signing of Bradley \"Frosty\" Bergstrom, a two-time Halo World Championship winner.\nOn January 13, 2023, SnakeBite, Royal2, Frosty, and Royal1 departed the organization. On the same day, Sentinels signed Kahari \"Kuhlect\" Miller, Tyler \"Spartan\" Ganza, Nick \"KingNick\" Panzella, and Kyle \"Chig\" Lawson. Exactly three months later, Kuhlect is released from the active roster, and a few days later on April 17 the organization signs Ayden \"Suspector\" Hill. A few months later on June 23, Suspector and KingNick depart the team, and Sentinels pick up Jesse \"bubu dubu\" Moeller and Michael \"Falcated\" Garcia.\nFormer divisions.\n\"League of Legends\".\nFor Phoenix1's inaugural season, the team signed top laner Derek \"zig\" Shao, jungler Rami \"Inori\" Charagh, Sang-ook \"Ryu\" Yoo, bot laner Dong-hyeon \"Arrow\" No, and support Adrian \"Adrian\" Ma.\n\"Fortnite\".\nIn July 2018, Sentinels began their \"Fortnite\" division after signing the players of the North American team TT. Included in the signings were Owen \"Animal\" Wright, Jaden \"rieo\" Leis, Mike \"mikeqt\" DeMarco, and Cayden \"Carose\" Bradford. In March 2019, Sentinels signed Kyle \"Bugha\" Giersdorf. On December 29, 2022, Sentinels announced their exit from competitive \"Fortnite\"."

        "text": "The Oregon State Beavers women's gymnastics team represents Oregon State University in NCAA women's artistic gymnastics, competing at the Gill Coliseum in Corvallis, Oregon.\nHistory.\nThe program began in 1966; competing the first time in 1967, with Sylvia Moore taking the lead as the first gymnastics coach of the modern era of Oregon State. She headed the program until 1975, when Ron Ludwig succeeded her – the Beavers finished sixth at the AIAW Regional in Monmouth, Oregon. With Ludwig at the helm, the Beavers won the Regional Championship five times, not placing below fourth the whole ten years he was leading. In 1979, Oregon State finished seventh at the AIAW Championships. The next season the Beavers finished in a record fourth in the team competition, with two representatives in event finals. In 1981, Mary Ayotte finished in a record seventh place in the all-around at Nationals as the Beavers placed seventh but, the Beavers' first National champion was Laurie Carter, who won the balance beam. Mary Ayotte soon became Oregon State's second National champion when, in 1982, she was the National floor champion. 1983 saw the Beavers finish ninth at Nationals. Heidi Anderson, a transfer from Penn State, won the balance beam title in 1984. Oregon State were sixth in 1985. Ludwig resigned in June 1985, citing health problems.\nJim Turpin succeeded Ludwig, taking time for the program to adjust with no representation at the 1986 Nationals; the program did finish third at Regionals though. The program didn't advance to Nationals again in 1987, but were seventh in 1988, advancing following their Regional win at home in Corvallis. Joy Selig was fourteenth in the all-around and took a silver medal in the floor exercise. Selig proved to be a strong Beaver gymnast with a beam national title in 1989. 1990 was another great year for Selig as she defended her beam title, as well as gaining the floor title too. In 1991, the Beavers were fourth in the team competition and saw medals from Chari Knight and Joy Selig. Amy Durham tied with two gymnasts in 1993 for the National floor title. Turpin left the Beavers program following the 1997 season, and former UCLA standout Tanya Chaplin became his successor. In 2001, Katrina Severin was second on the vault. The Beavers won the 2008 West Regional, held in Corvallis. Mandi Rodriguez was third on vault at the 2010 Nationals. 2011 saw the Beavers win the NCAA Regional and Jen Kesler and Makayla Stambaugh make the uneven bars podium. In 2012, Melanie Jones took a bronze on floor. In 2014, Madeline Gardiner took a bronze medal in the beam. Junior Risa Perez who transferred from Arizona State in 2015 was top 3 at Pac-12 championships on Floor Routine, in 2016 Gardner along with now senior Risa Perez won the Pac-12 Beam Championships, Perez won the Regional Beam Georgia Championships finished 8th overall at Texas Nationals. Gardiner then repeated this the following year in 2015.\nCurrent roster.\nBelow is a roster of gymnasts on the team for the 2023–2024 season."

        "text": "Bertram Allen (born 1 August 1995) is an Irish show jumping rider. Originally from Wexford, he has won international medals at the pony, junior, and senior level. He won the opening round of the 2014 World Equestrian Games in Normandy at age 19, receiving international recognition. Allen is the youngest winner of a Grand Prix on the Longines Global Champions Tour, and was a team gold medalist at the 2017 European Championship in Gothenburg.\nHe runs his Ballywalter Stables in Hünxe with his sister, April, who manages the operation. Allen has been based in Germany since 2011. \nBertram has a much wider family through his granddad Thomas Allen. Thomas has a brother Desmond, a sister Geraldine and another sister Mary. Desmond has 2 daughters 2 sons (Bertram’s Cousins) and 4 Grandchildren. His 2 daughters were very into horse riding just like Bertram but the boys not so much. His 2 sons one a pilot and the other a music producer both have two children both with one girl and one boy. Derek Allen (The Pilot) has a child called Kathrine and another Cillian and lives in America. And Carl Allen (The Music producer) has 2 children Katie and Marc. Although Carl and Derek have children the two ladies do not. Mary and Geraldine didn't have any kids but certainly treated Bertram and the rest of there grandchildren like their own. \nEarly life and career.\nAllen and his six siblings grew up with a strong equestrian influence, since their father owned and developed racehorses. Allen began riding at a local stable, and soon began competing. He then trained with Mag and Con Power; the helped him join Billy Twomey, who has influenced Allen's career.\nHe had successfully competed on ponies, winning every championship at the Dublin Horse Show and individual gold and team silver medals at the European Championships on Bishop Burton in the pony jumper classes in 2010. Allen competed on horses as a juniors, winning a team gold medal with Wild Thing L in 2012 and an individual silver medal with Molly Malone V in 2013. Twomey found Allen's early horses, Romanov, Molly Malone V and Wild Thing L, on whom he was successful.\nAt age 15, Allen moved to Hünxe. He rode his first senior competitions at age 17, where he jumped a double clear round in his first Nations Cup. Allen was introduced to Marcus Ehning (whose stable is 20 minutes away from Allen's) around this time, and Ehning became Allen's trainer.\nProfessional career.\nAllen was successful early on the senior international level. At age 18 he won the opening speed round of the 2014 World Equestrian Games in Normandy, finishing seventh overall. Allen finished third overall at the World Cup Jumping Finals in Las Vegas; both were on Molly Malone V. He won the 2014 Dublin Grand Prix on Molly Malone V, and was a member of the Irish Nations Cup team at Dublin (on Romanov) which won the Aga Khan Trophy. Allen is also the youngest rider to win a 5* Grand Prix on the Global Champions Tour, in Paris in 2015.\nAllen was not chosen for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, despite winning the Irish individual spot; Greg Broderick and MHS Going Global were selected instead. Broderick was ranked 252nd in the world, and Allen was ranked in the top ten. Allen had top placings throughout the year, however, including 5* competitions in Mexico City, Madrid, Hamburg, Hong Kong and Paris.\nHe was on the gold medal-winning Irish team at the 2017 European Championships with Hector van d'Abdijhoeve, despite a fall during the competition. Allen won the 5* Grand Prix in St. Gallen on Hector van d'Abdijhoeve, in addition to 5* wins in Doha, Mexico City, Hamburg, Helsinki, Olympia London Olympia and at the Dutch Masters. He continued competing at a high level in 2018, riding for the Global Champions League team Valkenswaard United (which finished second in the league playoffs). Allen purchased Harley vd Bisschop (a stallion formerly ridden by Nicola Philippaerts) in October of that year, selling Hector van d'Abdijhoeve ro Denis Lynch in January 2019. He and GK Caspar won the World Cup Qualifier at the Royal Agricultural Winter Fair in Toronto, and had several wins in 2020 before the season was halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. That year, Allen's horses included GK Casper, Lafayette Van Overis, Harley vd Bisschop, Gun Powder, Quiet Easy 4, Go To Fortuna and Pacino Amerio."

Four teams qualified themselves for this final stage by winning the four second round groups: Poland (winners of Group A), West Germany (Group B), Italy, (Group C) and France (Group D).\nIn the knockout stage, if a match was level at the end of 90 minutes, extra time of two periods (15 minutes each) would be played. In all matches except the final, if the score was still level after extra time, the match would be decided by a penalty shootout. Should the final be level after extra time, the match would instead be replayed.\nQualified teams.\nThe top placed team from each of the four groups of the second round qualified for the knockout stage.\nThird place play-off.\nThis was the first of what is an ongoing streak of eleven consecutive World Cups in which a European team finished third."

In May 2020, the Italian Winter Sports Federation (FISI) and the event organizing committee asked the International Ski Federation (FIS) to postpone the event until 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the request was rejected by FIS, and the organizers then moved forward with plans for 2021.\nThe host city was selected at the FIS Congress in Cancún, Mexico, on 10 June 2016. Cortina d'Ampezzo was the only applicant, and had been a finalist for the previous two championships.\nCortina previously hosted the world championships in 1932 and 1956 (Winter Olympics) and has held numerous World Cup events; the Tofane is a regular stop for women's speed events in January. It is scheduled to host the alpine skiing events of the 2026 Winter Olympics.\nThis was the seventh edition in Italy; in addition to Cortina, other sites were Bormio (2005, 1985), Sestriere (1997), and Val Gardena (1970). Sestriere was also the alpine host for the 2006 Winter Olympics, with women's speed events at San Sicario.\nRussia doping ban.\nOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with laboratory data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated.\nAs a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2021–22 World Championships and 2022 Winter Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. The title of the neutral banner has yet to be determined; WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision.\nAfter reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as \"Neutral Athlete\" or \"Neutral Team\". The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display \"Russia\" on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform's design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the \"Neutral Athlete/Team\" designation.\nSchedule and course information.\nThirteen events were scheduled and completed.\n\"All times are local (UTC+1).\"\nParticipating countries.\nA total of 68 countries competed"

        "title": "1969 Kentucky Derby",
        "text": "The 1969 Kentucky Derby was the 95th running of the Kentucky Derby. The race took place on May 3, 1969, at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky. It was a beautiful day, the dirt tracked was in excellent condition for the race.\nHistory.\nThe Kentucky Derby is the longest lasting sports event in the United States. It was first held in 1875 at Churchill Downs. The derby itself came to be by its creator Meriwether Lewis Clark Jr. He came to the idea of the Kentucky Derby from his time in Europe. When Meriwether was there, he happened to watch some horse races at the time and wanted to bring it to America. When he came back, he was able to get the land for Churchill Downs from his uncles. After he developed the track the first race was held on May 17, 1875. There was said to be up to 10 thousand people in attendance to watch the 15 thoroughbred horses race the 1.5-mile race. The winning horse of the first race was Aristides with the jockey being Oliver Lewis. They ran a 2-minute, 37.75-second time to win the first Kentucky Derby. Over time since the first race many things have changed from the first derby but the biggest difference to most people would be the change of distance of the race from 1.5 miles to 1.25. This change occurred due to many complaints in the racing community about the race being too long, so the length was later changed in 1896.\nRace description.\nBang they are off in the race, as Ocean Roar gets out to the lead with Arts and Letters just on his tail with Top Knight and Majestic Prince right behind them. Majestic Prince then made a strong move along the outside trying to make a jump up, while the rest of the back was one to two lengths back from the front of the pack. Ocean Roar was still holding on strong to his lead by four to five lengths with Majestic Prince and Arts and Letters just right behind in the race. With Majestic Prince and Arts and Letters on the inside, Top Knight started his run on the outside, as the three horses were almost neck to neck with each other, but they were still behind Ocean Roar. Ocean Roar then starts to fall back to the rest of the pack. Majestic Prince is on the inside with Arts and Letters and Ocean Roar right there with him, but here comes Dike making a run on the outside behind Ocean Roar. The first pack is making their run down the backstretch of the track, at this point in the race, Traffic Mark starts to make a run on the outside for the front pack, and with Majestic Prince, Arts and Letters, and Dike in the front now that Ocean Roar has began to fall behind with Traffic Mark taking his spot in the running, at the third turn Top Knight is leading by a head with Majestic Prince right on his tail, as Majestic Prince is making his move on the inside with Arts and Letters right the in the middle with Dike on the outside all within a length with the final turn of the race. Arts and Letters pushes through to take the lead at this point with Majestic Prince and Dike right there while Traffic Mark is sticking with the front runner but about a length and a half behind. Coming to an end Majestic Prince and Arts and Letters took a one length lead from the pack, as they were neck and neck going into the final leg of the race. Majestic Prince pushes through that last leg and gets a neck length of gap between him and Arts and Letters, that neck length brought home the win for Majestic Prince with Arts and Letters to his neck just behind, and to the finish Dike was on Majestic Prince's right on the outside and back just a length from Majestic Prince and right on Arts and Letters' tail, and the rest of the pack was lengths behind at the time of the top three finishing."

        "title": "Southern Combination Challenge Cup",
        "text": "The Southern Combination Challenge Cup is a football competition contested by non-league clubs. An independent cup, it was directly affiliated to the Football Association until 2015, when a change in FA Rules required such competitions to affiliate with the county of the majority of its member clubs: this is currently the Surrey County FA for this competition. The competition was founded in March 1958, as the Southern Combination Amateur Challenge Cup Competition. The word \"Amateur\" was later dropped in 1974. It is often referred to as simply the Southern Combination Cup.\nThe competition's rules state that entrants must be based within 25 miles of Weybridge, Surrey (until 1998, within 25 miles of Kingston upon Thames). At least two other competitions with similar names existed, in different areas of south east England:\n(1) the Southern Counties Combination Football League started in 1971 as a league competition in Sussex (and later southern parts of Surrey), with an associated League Cup and, a few years later, a Midweek Floodlight [Cup] Competition. This competition closed down in 2002, with the last winners being Fleet Town - a club from Hampshire who, incidentally, have also entered the Southern Combination Challenge Cup.\n(2) the Southern Combination Cup, which started around 1980, and offered a set of the sponsors', Phillips', floodlights to the inaugural winners. In some years, a Reserve Section was also contested. Known entrants were from the Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire area, but the competition ceased following Stotfold's victory in 1996.\nHampton &amp; Richmond Borough are the most successful club in the competition's history, having lifted the cup eight times. With seven of those coming under the name of Hampton, their most recent success came during the 2004–05 season. There have been 24 different winners, with Farnham Town FC the current holders after beating Balham 3-2 aet in May 2023 in front of 1,143 fans.\nHistory.\nUntil the 1994–95 season, the competition would comprise a maximum 16 teams starting in the First Round. If extra clubs were competing that year, a Preliminary Round would be added. However, this figure rose to 20 teams ahead of the 1998-99 campaign and the AGM agreed to start the competition in the Second Round, should 16 teams be included. They believed the suffix of Preliminary Round added to the difficulty of selling fixtures to the paying public. The final Preliminary Round fixture came during the 1994–95 season, with Epsom &amp; Ewell recording a 6–0 victory over Walton &amp; Hersham in a replay.\nPenalties were introduced into the competition in 1979, but only if both clubs agreed and liaised with the match officials beforehand. They were made compulsory in 1995, should any game be drawn following extra time. In recent years, the competition has typically been dominated by teams in the ninth and tenth tiers of the English football league system, although other non-league teams, such as Staines Town and Leatherhead, have also used the competition as a Reserve team event. The Combined Counties Football League has labelled the competition \"a supplementary Combined Counties League Cup\".\nFinals.\n\"Season-by-season list of winners and runners-up.\"\nResults by team.\n\"A list of all clubs to have reached the Final of the competition since formation.\"\n† denotes that in this year the final was unplayed and the cup was shared between the two clubs who qualified for it.

The race took place on May 4, 1968.\nThe race was the first Kentucky Derby in which the winning horse was subsequently disqualified. Dancer's Image won the race, but was disqualified to last after traces of phenylbutazone were discovered in the mandatory post-race urinalysis. Second-place finisher Forward Pass was declared the winner. The controversy filled the sporting news of media outlets in North America and was a cover story for \"Sports Illustrated\", which referred to it as \"the year's major sports story.\"\nRace Description.\nStarting off out of the gates Dancers Image had a bad break out of the gate, leading the horse to fall behind very quickly being in last. Then Dancers Image started to make a comeback and getting all the way back to the front and by the 8th pole passed the favorite, Forward Pass, Leading Dancers image to victory.

        "title": "Survivor Series (2016)",
        "text": "The 2016 Survivor Series was the 30th annual Survivor Series professional wrestling pay-per-view (PPV) and livestreaming event produced by WWE. It was held for wrestlers from the promotion's Raw and SmackDown brand divisions. The event took place on November 20, 2016, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was the first to be four hours in length. It was also the first Survivor Series held following the reintroduction of the brand split. This was second Survivor Series to take place in Canada since 1997.\nEight matches were contested at the event, including two on the Kickoff pre-show. The main event featured the in-ring return of Goldberg (his last match was in March 2004 at WrestleMania XX), where he defeated Brock Lesnar in 1 minute and 26 seconds. The other five matches on the main card were interbrand matches, featuring wrestlers from the Raw brand against wrestlers from the SmackDown brand. Three of those matches were Survivor Series elimination matches; Raw's women and tag teams defeated SmackDown's while SmackDown's men defeated Raw in the penultimate match. In other prominent matches, SmackDown's Intercontinental Champion The Miz and Raw's WWE Cruiserweight Champion The Brian Kendrick retained their titles against challengers from the opposing brand, Raw's Sami Zayn and SmackDown's Kalisto, respectively; Had Kalisto won the Cruiserweight Championship, the entire cruiserweight division would have been transferred to SmackDown. The 2016 event also had both the longest and the (tied) shortest matches in the event's history.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nSurvivor Series is an annual gimmick event produced every November by WWE since 1987. The second longest running pay-per-view (PPV) event in history (behind WWE's WrestleMania), it is one of the promotion's original four pay-per-views, along with WrestleMania, Royal Rumble, and SummerSlam, referred to as the \"Big Four\". The event is traditionally characterized by having Survivor Series matches, which are tag team elimination matches that typically pits teams of four or five wrestlers against each other. In July, WWE reintroduced the brand extension, again splitting the roster between the Raw and SmackDown brands where wrestlers were exclusively assigned to perform. Subsequently, the 2016 event, which was the 30th Survivor Series, featured several interpromotional matches to determine which was the better brand, similar to WWE's previous Bragging Rights pay-per-view. The event was scheduled to be held on November 20, 2016, at the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and was the first Survivor Series event to take place in Canada since 1997, which was known for the infamous \"Montreal Screwjob\" incident. The event aired on pay-per-view worldwide and was available to livestream on the WWE Network. Tickets went on sale July 15 through Ticketmaster. WWE also expanded the event's length to four hours, marking the first Survivor Series held for this length, which was previously reserved for WrestleMania.\nOn the October 11 episode of \"SmackDown Live\", SmackDown's Commissioner Shane McMahon and General Manager Daniel Bryan challenged Raw to three traditional Survivor Series elimination matches, involving each brand's best five male wrestlers, best five female wrestlers, and best five tag teams, respectively—with the latter having a total of 10 wrestlers per team, but with the stipulation being that if one member of a tag team was eliminated, both members of that particular tag team were eliminated (this was the first Survivor Series since the 1988 event to have teams of five tag teams going against each other). The following week on \"Monday Night Raw\", Raw Commissioner Stephanie McMahon accepted the challenge to determine the better brand; this would be the genesis for the theme of the following years' events.\nStorylines.\nThe event comprised eight matches, including two on the Kickoff pre-show, that resulted from scripted storylines, where wrestlers portrayed heroes, villains, or less distinguishable characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. Results were predetermined by WWE's writers on the Raw and SmackDown brands, while storylines were produced on WWE's weekly television shows, \"Monday Night Raw\" and \"SmackDown Live\".\nOver the following weeks, several tag teams were scheduled for the tag team elimination match. For Team SmackDown, Heath Slater and Rhyno were made captain by virtue of being SmackDown Tag Team Champions on the October 25 episode of \"SmackDown\". They then successfully defended their titles (and their spot at Survivor Series) against The Spirit Squad (Kenny and Mikey) in an impromptu match. The same night, The Hype Bros (Zack Ryder and Mojo Rawley) qualified for the team by defeating The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor). American Alpha (Jason Jordan and Chad Gable) and The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso) both qualified on the November 1 episode by defeating The Spirit Squad and The Headbangers (Mosh and Thrasher), respectively. On the November 8 episode, Breezango defeated The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch) to qualify as the final tag team for Team SmackDown. On the final \"SmackDown\" before Survivor Series, Booker T in his King Booker character gave a motivational speech to the team. For Team Raw, Raw Tag Team Champions The New Day (Big E, Kofi Kingston, and Xavier Woods) were revealed as captains on the October 31 episode of \"Raw\". The remaining four spots were filled the following week: Cesaro and Sheamus, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, Enzo Amore and Big Cass, and The Golden Truth (Goldust and R-Truth). The New Day addressed the teams and then Gallows and Anderson, who were at odds with the rest of Team Raw, defeated Big E and Kingston in a non-title match. Also, R-Truth sold his team's spot to The Shining Stars (Epico and Primo) for a timeshare. The Golden Truth then fought The Shining Stars in a losing effort to get their spot back.\nThe spots for the women's elimination match were also successively filled. On the October 25 episode of \"SmackDown\", Nikki Bella became captain of Team SmackDown by defeating Natalya, who had demanded that position for herself. On the November 1 episode, SmackDown Women's Champion Becky Lynch, the number one contender Alexa Bliss, Carmella, and Naomi were revealed as the remaining team members, with Natalya introduced as the team's coach. On the November 8 episode, the team's unity was strained when Carmella confronted Bella. Natalya, who was involved in a match against Naomi, tried to separate the two, which cost her the match. The same night, Lynch successfully defended her championship against Bliss, albeit in controversial fashion. For Team Raw, Raw Women's Champion Charlotte Flair (as team captain), Bayley, and Nia Jax were revealed as team members on the October 31 episode of \"Raw\". On the November 7 episode, Alicia Fox and Sasha Banks were introduced as the final members. Earlier, Charlotte had falsely advertised her protégé Dana Brooke as the fifth member, only to be corrected by Michael Cole. Banks, Bayley, and Fox then defeated Charlotte, Jax, and Brooke in a six-woman tag team match when Bayley pinned Charlotte. On the November 14 episode, due to differences between team members, Charlotte and Banks teamed up and defeated Fox and Jax. On the final \"SmackDown\" before Survivor Series, Charlotte came down to ringside during a match between Bella and Carmella. Bella then attacked Charlotte, which prompted the rest of Team Raw to attack Bella. Carmella and the rest of Team SmackDown then came to Bella's aid. The two teams brawled with Team SmackDown getting the upper hand.\nThe teams for the men's elimination match began to take shape on the October 31 episode of \"Raw\", when after weeks of lobbying for the position, WWE Universal Champion Kevin Owens and Chris Jericho were made co-captains of Team Raw. General Manager Mick Foley then also added United States Champion Roman Reigns. Braun Strowman qualified by winning a 12-man battle royal. On the November 7 episode, Seth Rollins was revealed as the final member. To settle the team's differences, Stephanie McMahon put all five men in a fatal five-way match, which culminated in Owens accidentally pinning Jericho. On the final \"Raw\" before Survivor Series, Stephanie tested the team's unity by having the team of Owens and Reigns and the team of Jericho, Rollins, and Strowman face Cesaro and Sheamus and The New Day, respectively, which both teams won. For Team SmackDown, Daniel Bryan introduced all members on the November 1 episode of \"SmackDown\": WWE World Champion AJ Styles (as captain), Dean Ambrose, Randy Orton, Bray Wyatt, and Baron Corbin. A week later, Shane McMahon made James Ellsworth the team's mascot. To settle some of the team's differences, Shane also scheduled a six-man tag match pitting The New Wyatt Family (Bray, Orton, and Luke Harper) against Ambrose, Ellsworth, and Corbin. When Corbin refused to take part in the match, he was replaced by Kane, and Corbin instead wrestled Kalisto; during the match, he was kayfabe injured, rendering him unable to compete at Survivor Series. After the Wyatts defeated Ambrose, Ellsworth, and Kane, Daniel Bryan named Shane McMahon as Corbin's replacement at Survivor Series. On the November 7 episode of \"Raw\", Stephanie invited both Shane and Bryan to appear on the following week's \"Raw\" to address the interpromotional matches, which Shane and Bryan accepted. During this meeting, each commissioner and general manager touted the reasons for why their respective brand was better and eventually called out their respective male teams. In the ensuing battle, Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins of Team Raw stood tall at the end. On the final \"SmackDown\" before Survivor Series, SmackDown's male team were the guests on Edge's \"Cutting Edge\" show to address the match and their team unity. The Undertaker then came out and warned the team to win the match or face consequences.\nAt WrestleMania XX in 2004, Goldberg defeated Brock Lesnar. This was their only match against each other as both left WWE after the event; Lesnar returned to the WWE in 2012. Goldberg, who originally had no intention of ever returning to WWE, began a working relationship with the promotion again in January 2016, thanks to 2K Sports, who publishes the \"WWE 2K\" video games. On the May 30 episode of \"Raw\", Goldberg was revealed as the pre-order bonus for the \"WWE 2K17\" video game, which featured Lesnar on the cover. During the 2016 SummerSlam weekend at the \"WWE 2K\" event in Germany, Goldberg jokingly challenged Lesnar to a match. Lesnar and Goldberg continually traded barbs and insults against each other on social media and at \"WWE 2K17\" press events. On October 5, Goldberg appeared on ESPN's \"SportsCenter\" with Jonathan Coachman to promote his appearance in \"WWE 2K17\". He teased a possible return to WWE, and stated that he would want to face Lesnar if he were to return because he owed Lesnar a rematch. On the October 10 episode of \"Raw\", Paul Heyman on behalf of Lesnar issued a challenge to Goldberg, stating that Goldberg was the one blemish on Lesnar's WWE career. On the October 17 episode, Goldberg accepted the challenge. The following week, the match was scheduled for Survivor Series.\nAt No Mercy, Dolph Ziggler defeated The Miz in a career vs. title match for the Intercontinental Championship. Ziggler offered The Miz a rematch for the title, but The Miz refused. On the November 1 episode of \"SmackDown\", after successfully defending the Intercontinental Championship against Curt Hawkins, Ziggler made an open challenge to any wrestler from the Raw brand to face him for the title at Survivor Series. On the November 7 episode of \"Raw\", Sami Zayn revealed that Mick Foley wanted him to face Ziggler for the Intercontinental title, but Stephanie preferred Rusev and scheduled a match between the two, with the winner going on to face Ziggler. Zayn defeated Rusev, earning the title match. However, his opponent changed when The Miz regained the title from Ziggler, albeit with help from Maryse, on \"SmackDown\"s 900th episode on November 15.\nOn the November 8 episode of \"SmackDown\", Bryan revealed that since SmackDown's Intercontinental Championship would be defended against a wrestler from Raw, Foley allowed Raw's WWE Cruiserweight Champion The Brian Kendrick to defend the title against a SmackDown wrestler. Bryan chose Kalisto and revealed that if Kalisto would win the title, the entire cruiserweight division would come to SmackDown. On the November 14 episode of \"Raw\", Kendrick addressed the cruiserweights, and assured them that he would defeat Kalisto and keep the division on Raw. However, all were at odds with him and Sin Cara, Kalisto's former tag team partner, stated that Kalisto would be a better champion. Kendrick won an ensuing match against Sin Cara by submission.\nEvent.\nPre-show.\nDuring the Survivor Series Kickoff pre-show, T. J. Perkins, Rich Swann, and Noam Dar defeated Tony Nese, Drew Gulak, and Ariya Daivari when Swann executed a standing 450° splash on Daivari for a pinfall.\nLater, Kane defeated Luke Harper after a chokeslam.\nPreliminary matches.\nThe actual pay-per-view opened with the women's Survivor Series match pitting Team Raw (Charlotte, Bayley, Sasha Banks, Alicia Fox, and Nia Jax) against Team SmackDown (Nikki Bella, Carmella, Naomi, Alexa Bliss, and Becky Lynch) in a 5-on-5 Survivor Series Elimination Match. Immediately before the match, SmackDown's captain Nikki Bella was attacked backstage, leaving her unable to compete, and team coach Natalya replaced her. Fox pinned Carmella after a scissors kick but was herself pinned by Bliss after \"Twisted Bliss\". Naomi was counted out after Jax attacked her. Natalya pinned Banks with a roll-up but was pinned by Charlotte after a \"Queen's Boot\". Lynch forced Jax submit to the \"Dis-arm-her\", eliminating Jax. Charlotte pinned Bliss with a \"Queen's Boot\". Bayley pinned Lynch after a \"Bayley-to-Belly Suplex\", leaving Bayley and Charlotte as the survivors for Team Raw. After the match, Charlotte attacked Bayley.\nNext, The Miz defended the Intercontinental Championship against Sami Zayn. In the end, Zayn applied the Figure-four leglock on Miz; as Miz was about to submit, Miz's manager Maryse rang the ring bell. Zayn released the hold, thinking he had won, but Miz pinned him with a roll-up to retain the title.\nAfter this, Team Raw (The New Day (Big E and Kofi Kingston), Cesaro and Sheamus, Enzo Amore and Big Cass, The Shining Stars (Epico and Primo), and Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson) faced Team SmackDown (Heath Slater and Rhyno, The Hype Bros (Zack Ryder and Mojo Rawley), American Alpha (Chad Gable and Jason Jordan), Breezango (Tyler Breeze and Fandango), and The Usos (Jey Uso and Jimmy Uso)) in the tag team's Survivor Series match. Breezango, in their new fashion police attire, began by handing out tickets to everyone but were quickly eliminated by The New Day after the \"Midnight Hour\" (a \"Big Ending\" and diving DDT combination) on Fandango. Immediately after, Jimmy executed a superkick on Kingston for a pinfall to eliminate New Day. Gallows and Anderson performed a \"Magic Killer\" on Zack Ryder, eliminating The Hype Bros. American Alpha executed an electric chair/diving bulldog combination on Primo, eliminating The Shining Stars. Gallows and Anderson eliminated American Alpha with a \"Magic Killer\" on Jason Jordan, but were eliminated by Rhyno and Heath Slater after Rhyno performed a \"Gore\" on Gallows. Enzo Amore and Big Cass then performed a \"Bada Boom Shakalaka\" on Rhyno, eliminating him and Heath Slater. The Usos eliminated Enzo and Cass after a \"Samoan Splash\" on Enzo. In the end, Cesaro applied the Sharpshooter on Jey while Sheamus performed a \"Brogue Kick\" on Jimmy. Jey submitted, leaving Cesaro and Sheamus as the sole survivors for Team Raw.\nIn the fourth match, The Brian Kendrick defended the WWE Cruiserweight Championship against Kalisto. Kendrick won by disqualification after Baron Corbin attacked Kendrick and then Kalisto, meaning Kendrick retained the title and the cruiserweight division remained on Raw. Backstage, Daniel Bryan confronted Corbin, who explained that he acted out of revenge on Kalisto to prevent more cruiserweights from appearing on SmackDown.\nThe next match was the men's Survivor Series elimination match featuring Team Raw (Kevin Owens, Chris Jericho, Braun Strowman, Roman Reigns, and Seth Rollins) against Team SmackDown (AJ Styles, Dean Ambrose, Bray Wyatt, Randy Orton, and Shane McMahon), who were accompanied by their mascot, James Ellsworth. Early in the match, Ambrose and Styles got into a heated argument. Ambrose attacked Styles, but was surprised by Strowman, who scored a pinfall after a running powerslam; Styles did not attempt to break the pin. Afterwards outside the ring, Orton executed an \"RKO\" on Strowman onto a broadcast table. McMahon put Strowman through the table with a \"Leap of Faith\". Strowman was counted out when Ellsworth, who hid under the ring, held Strowman's legs to prevent him from returning to the ring. Strowman then chased Ellsworth up the entrance ramp and threw him off the stage. Later, Styles attempted the \"Styles Clash\" on Jericho but Owens attacked Styles with the \"List of Jericho\" and was disqualified. Jericho was distraught by his list being ripped apart. This allowed Orton to pin him after an \"RKO\". McMahon then attempted a \"Coast to Coast\" but Reigns caught him mid-air with a spear. The referee ruled the apparently unconscious Shane unfit to continue, eliminating him from the match. Ambrose, who had already been eliminated, returned to attack Styles and helped his former Shield brethren Rollins and Reigns perform a triple powerbomb on Styles through a broadcast table. Rollins rolled Styles back in the ring for the pinfall. As Rollins attempted a Frog Splash on Wyatt, Orton quickly performed an \"RKO\" on Rollins, allowing Wyatt to score a pinfall. Reigns, Team Raw's final member, attempted a spear on Wyatt, however, Reigns performed a spear on Orton instead, who had pushed Wyatt out of the way. Wyatt then performed \"Sister Abigail\" on Reigns for the pin, leaving Wyatt and Orton as the survivors for Team SmackDown.\nMain event.\nIn the main event, Goldberg faced Brock Lesnar (accompanied by Paul Heyman). Lesnar tackled Goldberg into the corner, only for Goldberg to shove Lesnar to the mat. As Lesnar stood up, Goldberg performed a spear on Lesnar. Goldberg then executed another spear and a \"Jackhammer\" on Lesnar to win the match.\nAftermath.\nRaw.\nOn the following night's \"Raw\", Goldberg celebrated his victory over Brock Lesnar and declared himself as the first entrant in the 2017 Royal Rumble match. The following week, Paul Heyman commented that he and Lesnar had been humiliated by Goldberg, whom they had underestimated, and that Lesnar would also compete in the Royal Rumble. Lesnar entered at number twenty-six and dispatched of several other wrestlers before Goldberg came out at number twenty-eight and once again humiliated Lesnar by quickly eliminating him from the match. They fought once more at WrestleMania 33, where Lesnar defeated Goldberg in a match for the Universal Championship to end the feud.\nOn the post-Survivor Series \"Raw\", Sami Zayn was punished for failing to bring the Intercontinental Championship to his brand by being put into a match against Braun Strowman. Strowman brutalized Zayn until he was no longer able to compete and Mick Foley stopped the match, giving the win to Strowman. The following week, Zayn demanded a rematch, but Foley declined, telling Zayn that he could not beat Strowman. Zayn shoved off and on the December 12 episode, again asked for a rematch, but was again rejected. Zayn pondered switching to \"SmackDown\" because Foley did not believe in him. After Strowman won his match, Strowman declared that no one could last two minutes with him. Later that night, after Zayn won his match, Foley told Zayn that he had arranged to trade Zayn to SmackDown in return for Eva Marie. An angry Zayn refused such a lopsided trade and again demanded for a rematch against Strowman. Foley yielded and scheduled Zayn to face Strowman at in a match with a ten-minute time limit.\nAfter winning the elimination tag team match for Raw, Cesaro and Sheamus were granted a title shot for the Raw Tag Team Championship against The New Day (Kofi Kingston and Big E, accompanied by Xavier Woods) the next night on \"Raw\". However, The New Day retained. Two weeks later, Cesaro and Sheamus fought Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson to determine the number one contenders, but the match ended in a no contest when The New Day interfered. This turned the title match on the December 12 episode into a triple threat tag team match, where The New Day retained. At \"WWE Tribute to the Troops\", Cesaro and Sheamus earned another title match at Roadblock: End of the Line by winning a fatal four-way tag team match.\nOn the \"Highlight Reel\" during \"Raw\", Chris Jericho got into a heated argument with his best friend Kevin Owens. Jericho blamed Owens for using \"The List of Jericho\" as a weapon, whereas Owens explained that he tried to save Jericho from being eliminated. The two finally agreed that Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins were at fault for Team Raw's loss. Rollins then demanded a title shot for Owens's WWE Universal Championship, as he was guaranteed a match for being part of Team Raw. Mick Foley then scheduled Owens to defend the title in the main event against Rollins in a no disqualification match, with Reigns and Jericho banned from ringside. The match ended when Jericho, disguised as a masked fan, interfered, allowing Owens to capitalize and retain the championship. The following week, the friendship between Owens and Jericho was strained further, when Owens stated he did not need Jericho's help against the challenge of Roman Reigns. Reigns then defeated Owens to earn a title match for the Universal Championship at Roadblock: End of the Line.\nAlso on \"Raw\", Charlotte justified her attack on Bayley, stating she no longer had to be her teammate after the match. She was then confronted by Sasha Banks, who invoked her championship rematch clause. Charlotte agreed, but insisted that the match would take place the following week, in her own hometown. The next week, the match initially ended in a double countout. Afterwards, General Manager Mick Foley restarted the match later that night as a Falls Count Anywhere match, where Banks defeated Charlotte for her third Raw Women's Championship. On the December 5 episode, Banks challenged Charlotte to an Iron Woman match for the title at Roadblock: End of the Line, which was made official later that night.\nRich Swann defeated T. J. Perkins and Noam Dar in a triple threat match to become the number one contender for the Cruiserweight Championship. On the premiere of the cruiserweight's new exclusive show, \"205 Live\", Swann defeated Kendrick for the championship.\nSmackDown.\nOn the following episode of \"SmackDown\", Shane McMahon granted James Ellsworth a SmackDown contract for his dedication to the SmackDown brand. AJ Styles criticized this decision, arguing that Ellsworth should earn his contract in a ladder match. Ellsworth accepted the challenge, with both his new contract and a future opportunity at the WWE World Championship on the line. Dean Ambrose, who had been repeatedly sent out of the arena, returned during the match and helped Ellsworth defeat Styles.\nThe Miz confronted Daniel Bryan about retaining the Intercontinental Championship and gloated over Kalisto not winning his match. Bryan responded that the way Miz won his match humiliated SmackDown and then scheduled Miz to immediately defend the title against Kalisto. Miz won the match when Corbin distracted Kalisto. After the match, Corbin attacked Kalisto with the \"End of Days\", while Miz's celebration was cut short by Dolph Ziggler with a Superkick. Bryan later scheduled The Miz to defend the Intercontinental Championship against Ziggler at in a ladder match. As punishment for costing Kalisto two title opportunities and SmackDown the cruiserweight division, Bryan put Baron Corbin in a match against Kane. During the match, Kalisto attacked Corbin. Afterwards on \"Talking Smack\", a chairs match between the two was scheduled for TLC.\nThe dissension between SmackDown's women continued backstage as Alexa Bliss demanded another match for the SmackDown Women's Championship, which Becky Lynch accepted for TLC. After Natalya blamed Becky for her team's loss at Survivor Series, Shane blamed the entire team, especially the absence of Nikki Bella, and scheduled a match between Natalya and Becky. Becky won the match but was attacked afterwards by Alexa. The following week, during the contract signing, Becky attacked Alexa but was eventually put through a table by Alexa. The match between the two was made a tables match. Also backstage, Nikki Bella accused Carmella of being the one that attacked her at Survivor Series, which Carmella denied. Nikki added that regardless of who attacked her, she would settle her differences with Carmella at TLC in a no disqualification match.\nAfter winning the Survivor Series match for SmackDown's men's team, Bray Wyatt and Randy Orton challenged American Alpha, who had just become number one contenders for the SmackDown Tag Team Championship by defeating The Hype Bros, The Ascension, Breezango, The Usos, and The Vaudevillains in a Tag Team Turmoil, to put that spot on the line. The following week, Wyatt and Orton defeated American Alpha to become the number one contenders against Heath Slater and Rhyno at TLC.\nResults.\nTeam SmackDown's captain, Nikki Bella, was attacked backstage before the match, rendering her unable to compete. The team's coach, Natalya, replaced her."

        "text": "The Washburn Ichabods men's basketball team represents Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas, in the NCAA Division II men's basketball competition. The team is currently coached by Brett Ballard, who is in his first year at the helm. Ballard replaced Bob Chipman, who retired after the 2016–17 season. The Ichabods currently compete in the Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association (MIAA). The basketball team plays its home games in Lee Arena on campus.\nOverview.\nWashburn annually plays a thirty-game conference schedule that is preceded by an out-of-conference schedule that includes three exhibition games. The conference schedule consists of playing every MIAA member at least once, some twice.\nHistory.\nWashburn's basketball program began in with the 1905–06 season, forty years after the university was founded. Overall, the team has won 21 conference championships and one national title.\nThe beginning: 1905–1921.\nBeginning with the 1905–06 season, the program's first, Harry C. Byrd was chosen to lead the program. In his first four seasons as head coach, Byrd led the Ichabods to winning records and a total of 31–20. In 1909–10 season, Byrd led the Ichabods their first conference championship. In Byrd's 16 years as head coach, he led the team to nine winning seasons and seven losing seasons, compiling a record of 116–112–1.\nA new era: two new conferences (1921–1946).\nIn 1921, Dwight Ream took over the program for one season. After Ream left with an 8–9 record, Mike Vosburg took over for the 1922–23 season. Vosburg left with a 7–11 record. After two years with two different coaches, McPherson College coach, Dutch Lonborg, became head coach. From 1923 to 1927, Lonborg led the Ichabods to a 61–14–1 record, producing the second, and last, of the team's two ties as well as winning two conference regular season championships. Lonborg is a Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.\nWhen Lonborg left after the 1926–27 season, Washburn entered a new era: Roy Wynne was named head coach, and the school joined the newly created Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. During Wynne's three seasons as head coach, he produced a 29–22 record. Following Wynne's departure, McPherson's football coach, George Gardner, took over. Coaching for three seasons and a total record of 19–28, Gardner was fired and was replaced by Elmer Holm. Holm's first season was a losing season and the last year in the CIAC. In 1934, Washburn moved joined the Missouri Valley Conference. Holm led the team for two more seasons, ending with a record of 21–36. In 1936, Dee Errikson took over team, leading for the next ten seasons and through World War II. Errikson led the team to an overall record of 67–122, making him one of the most unsuccessful coaches in Washburn history.\nPost-World War II: 1946–1979.\nFor the next thirty years after World War II, the Washburn saw five coaches come and go, with the addition of an interim for three games. In 1946, Washburn rejoined the Central Intercollegiate Athletic Conference after competing in the Missouri Valley for nine seasons and no conference for three during the war. After the war, Washburn hired Topeka High School basketball coach Adrian Miller, for would coach for five seasons. Before Miller took the helm of the team, Washburn went nearly 20 years without a winning season and although Miller went 8–11 overall in his first season, Miller quickly turned the team around in 1947–48 going 15–9. For the next three seasons, Miller led the Ichabods to 10 wins or more. After the 1950–51 season, Miller resigned with a 64–46 record to become an insurance agent.\nAfter Miller resigned, Washburn hired former assistant Marion McDonald, who previously served as assistant coach for Fort Hays Kansas State College.\nIn 1960, Norm Short took over for the Ichabods for the next six seasons. During his six-season, Short led the team to a 46–74 record, with only one winning season. After leading the Ichabods to a 5–20, 2–6 conference record in 1965–66, Short resigned. Short coached at Central Missouri State from 1966 to 1972.\nBob Chipman era: 1979–present.\nIn 1979, Washburn assistant head coach Bob Chipman took over the program. During his first five years as head coach, Chipman led the Ichabods to a 105–46 overall record, winning the MIAA Tournament Championship in 1982–84. Two seasons later, Chipman led the Ichabods to Washburn's first – as well as his first – NAIA basketball championship. The following season, the Ichabods won the conference regular season championship.\nIn 1989, the Ichabods made the move from the NAIA to the NCAA Division II, which also meant they would join a new conference: the Missouri Intercollegiate Athletic Association. Since joining the MIAA, Chipman had led his teams to nine conference regular season championships, four conference championships, 11 NCAA Tournament appearances, and a national runners-up in 2001. Chipman retired at the end of the 2016–17 season."

        "text": "In baseball, an assist (denoted by A) is a defensive statistic, baseball being one of the few sports in which the \"defensive\" team controls the ball. An assist is credited to every defensive player who fields or touches the ball (after it has been hit by the batter) prior to the recording of a putout, even if the contact was unintentional. For example, if a ball strikes a player's leg and bounces off him to another fielder, who tags the baserunner, the first player is credited with an assist. A fielder can receive a maximum of one assist per out recorded. An assist is also credited if a putout would have occurred, had another fielder not committed an error. For example, a shortstop might field a ground ball cleanly, but the first baseman might drop his throw. In this case, an error would be charged to the first baseman, and the shortstop would be credited with an assist.\nRabbit Maranville is the all-time leader with 8,967 career assists. Ozzie Smith (8,375), Cal Ripken Jr. (8,214), Bill Dahlen (8,138), Omar Vizquel (8,050), and Luis Aparicio (8,016) are the only other players to record more than 8,000 career assists."

        "text": "Surfing at the Summer Olympics made its debut in the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. The Olympics was originally scheduled to be held in 2020, but was postponed to 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSetting.\nIn 2018, the International Surfing Association (ISA) announced that surfing at the 2020 Summer Olympics would take place in the ocean, and not in an artificial wave pool. The contest site for the 2020 Games was announced to be Tsurigasaki Beach located about outside of Tokyo in Ichinomiya, Chiba. To ensure quality surf, the contest will feature a waiting period of 16 days. Once the event runs, it will take two days to finish the competition.\nCompetition structure.\nThe 2020 Summer Olympics will use a four-person heat structure. Four athletes will compete at any given time. The best two of each heat will continue to the next round. Each heat will run for 20 to 25 minutes, with their top two scores being used.\nOnly one rider may ride a wave at any given time, using a common surfing etiquette rule where the surfer who is closest to the peak has right of way. Any interference with the surfer who has right of way can incur a penalty and result in point deductions.\nA panel of judges will determine each rider's performance from wave to wave, scoring from one to ten with two decimals. e.g. 8.51. Scores are based on the difficulty of manoeuvres performed. This includes speed, power, and flow of each manoeuvre.\nBid for inclusion.\nOn 28 September 2015, surfing was featured on a shortlist along with baseball, softball, skateboarding, karate, and sport climbing to be considered for inclusion in the 2020 Summer Olympics. On 3 August 2016 the International Olympic Committee voted to include all five sports (counting baseball and softball as a single sport) for inclusion in the 2020 Games. \nTwo major obstacles for surfing to be included in the Olympics for many years was that firstly, it would be difficult to hold surfing events in the event of a landlocked country hosting the Games (compared to sailing which can take place at a lake, surfing requires an ocean current with waves), and secondly, that drowning is one of the major risks in surfing: the IOC was reluctant to take high liabilities in the event of a competitor's death.\nNumber of participants.\n20 men and 20 women planned to compete in the 2020 Summer Olympics. However, one of the men, Carlos Muñoz, did not make it in time for his event. Surfing at the Olympics is currently limited to high-performance shortboards only, separated into categories of gender. If surfing is included in upcoming games such as Paris 2024 or Los Angeles 2028, other categories such as Longboarding, bodyboarding and SUP may be included.\nQualification.\nQuota places will be allocated to the athletes at the following events:\nThere is a maximum of 2 men and 2 women per NOC.\nCompetition schedule.\nDates are tentative. Competition will take place over 4 days between 25 July and 1 August, subject to wave conditions.\nFinals advanced to 27 July from 28 July, to take advantage of waves caused by Tropical Storm Nepartak.

        "title": "Malanda Falls Swimming Pool",
        "text": "Malanda Falls Swimming Pool is a heritage-listed swimming pool at Malanda Falls Park, Malanda, Tablelands Region, Queensland, Australia. It was built from 1906 onwards. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2010.\nHistory.\nMalanda Falls Swimming Pool is located on the North Johnstone River in the Malanda Falls Park, adjacent to the Malanda Falls Conservation Park on the Atherton Tableland. First developed as a local recreation area during the early 20th century, Malanda Falls became associated with organised tourism on the Atherton Tableland from the 1920s and has been important in the development of the Cairns hinterland as a major tourist region in Queensland.\nDespite the focus of early settlers and investors on economic exploitation of the landscape on the Atherton Tableland, a number of tourist attractions emerged based on the very resources being exploited and were largely framed in Romantic terms. Early non-indigenous visitors to the Atherton Tableland were fascinated with waterfalls and their jungle backdrop, variously described and depicted as sublime, beautiful and picturesque. Timeless in their appeal, these natural features were and continue to be essential to the success of the region in attracting tourists.\nDue to its proximity to the township of Malanda, the Falls have always been popular for local recreation and have been adapted over the last century to meet the needs of the local community and to enhance its beauty and bush surrounds as a tourist attraction.\nThe Malanda Falls was surveyed in 1906 when it was described as being \"partly covered with water lilies, and jungle stretched to the edge of the pool, with lots of fallen trees [in the] water\". With the exception of the installation of hydraulic rams in 1911 to supply water to the Malanda Hotel and to steam trains, it would appear that the Falls remained undisturbed until 1918 when the local community cleared the underwater logs from the pool. The Falls quickly became a popular venue for New Year's Day picnic day celebrations and by 1920 the Eacham Shire Council had erected a substantial wooden diving platform and signs warning against nude bathing.\nOther modifications included a wire netting fence erected around an unspecified area of the Malanda Falls Reserve in 1924, possibly to keep wandering animals from damaging the area. In 1925 when a retaining wall and a \"narrow turning platform for swimmers, 25 yards from the bank\" were built, Malanda's first swimming club was formed. Swimming carnivals were held between Malanda, Atherton, Mareeba and Cairns clubs in the pool until 1930. By 1934 the Malanda Swimming Club and the Eacham Shire Council had both contributed to the pool and surrounding reserve, with the Council's contribution amounting to in 1933. The Department of Lands approved an additional advance of for further enhancement works in 1934, and the Council engineer was instructed to look into building a path to the bottom of the Falls which was formed with terracing and gardens.\nA significant feature of early tourism in the Cairns region was its use of the increasingly sophisticated transport infrastructure to service the mining, timber and agricultural industries. Development in Far North Queensland like other regions in Queensland was hampered by a lack of basic infrastructure. The construction of the Tablelands railway from Cairns to Mareeba provided for the development of the Barron Falls into one of the most popular tourist attractions in Queensland in the 1890s. Malanda Falls was also to benefit from this, when in 1910 the railway was extended to Malanda and a railway bridge erected spanning the Johnstone River just above the Falls allowing excursioners from other parts of the Atherton Tableland to visit the Falls more easily. It was not until the construction of the Gillies Highway in the 1920s that it became accessible to a greater number of people, notably tourists.\nPhotographs of Malanda Falls appeared in tourism literature as early as 1920 and in 1925 the Falls were part of a day trip from either Herberton or Ravenshoe. This day trip was by car and also included on the itinerary were visits to Lake Barrine, Lake Eacham and Millaa Millaa Falls. Whitecars, a local hire-car service, commenced day tours of the southern Tableland offered two tours to Malanda Falls: one including a visit to Glen Allyn Falls and the Malanda township, and the other incorporating a tour of the Malanda Butter Factory and The Jungle, an attraction which featured Aboriginal culture and the wonders of the rainforest.\nEstablished , Whitecars was integral to the development of tourism on the Tablelands and the increased popularity of region's attractions. Initially, Whitecars owners, Les Battle and Norm Graham, developed a timetabled taxi service between Malanda, Yungaburra and Atherton, and between Malanda and Millaa Millaa, with three cars. They took advantage of the 1926 opening of the Gillies Highway, linking the southern Tableland with Cairns, to take Ned Williams into partnership as The Cairns Tableland Motor Service Ltd to capitalise on the expected influx of tourists. In 1927 the company won the tender to transport passengers between Cairns and the southern Tableland via the Gillies Highway, and to operate day tours on the Tableland out of Yungaburra. In 1934 Whitecars introduced its first bus, capable of carrying 17 passengers to the area which, by this time, was being described in tourist guides featuring the Falls as \"the land of waterfalls, cataracts and cascades\".\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, the Malanda Falls were included in the Grand Tour/Tropical Wonderland Tour itineraries promoted by the Queensland Government Tourist Bureau (by then part of Queensland Railways). The Grand Tour operated during the winter months when a P&amp;O ship would arrive at Cairns each week from Melbourne and Brisbane carrying around 200 passengers for a six-day stay in the region. Upon arrival passengers could join the Tropical Wonderland Tour, which included being taken by White cars to visit the attractions of the Atherton Tableland, including not only the Malanda Falls but also the Millaa Millaa, Zillie and Glen Allyn Falls.\nFrom 1942 a large number of Australian and American troops were stationed on the Atherton Tablelands during World War II. Malanda Falls was a popular swimming and picnic spot for service personnel and during the war years Australian troops upgraded the pool at the base of the Falls and built a three level platform diving tower.\nAs the tourism industry developed during the post war period, travel became easier and car ownership more commonplace and new tours were developed. Attractions such as Malanda Falls benefited from these changes and flourished. In 1961 a caravan park was established by the Eacham Shire Council, adjacent to the Falls with a capacity for 24 caravans, 30 camp sites and cabin accommodation for 20 people. Those staying at the caravan park inevitably visited the Falls and facilities were upgraded during the 1960s with the installation of a new concrete two-tiered diving platform along with a steel climbing frame allowing visitors to swing into the water, and grab rails and ladders to enter and leave the pool. In addition, the Malanda Swimming Club was reformed.\nMalanda Falls was prominent in travel literature until the 1970s and continues to be identified as a tourist destination. The welcoming ceremony of the \"Malanda Monsoon Festival\" is held at Malanda Falls where traditional owners the Ngadjon Jii people invite good spirits into the town. In addition a Waterfall Ceremony is held at dusk at the Falls which includes the lighting of lanterns beside the Johnstone River.\nDescription.\nMalanda Falls Swimming Pool is located within the Malanda Falls Park, adjacent to the Malanda Falls Conservation Park, and is located on the western outskirts of Malanda on the Malanda-Atherton Road.\nRainforest lines the road and either side of the entrance to the reserve. Beside the highway are a series of picnic tables and barbeques and a colourful mosaic honouring the area's Aborigines for whom Malanda Falls has special significance. A large car park has been developed more recently developed along with a shelter shed and toilet block.\nWhile the rainforest backdrop is a feature of and setting for the Falls, the river banks above the pool have been benched and mostly cleared of vegetation. The western side of the pool is highly structured with stone-walled terraces, manicured lawns, an extensive network of concrete paths, fences and steps and handrails. The terraces have three main levels that are constructed from coursed rubble stonework set in mortar with a concrete capping on top. The lower terrace has three additional concrete terraces and these are generally used as seating by visitors.\nThe Malanda Falls Scenic Reserve comprises the North Johnstone River flowing through dense rainforest and over the basalt rock of the Falls into a man-made swimming pool. The Falls has a height of about four metres and a width of approximately . The long pool at its base is surrounded by concrete paths which provide easy and safe access to the pool and which allow visitors to cross the pool. At the base of the falls at the end of the concrete path on the western side, there is a metal sign affixed to the rock face with the image of a diver in red.\nThe concrete bridge at the north end of the pool is approximately long. It leads to further concrete paths behind which a low coarse rubble retaining wall is located. Approximately halfway between the bridge and the Falls there are pool steps and a metal handrail attached to the concrete pathway. On the north eastern bank, steps with handrails lead to the Malanda Caravan Park. Further past these steps, towards the base of the Falls, are remnant concrete foundations, piping and the remains of a vertical boiler structure. The latter is riveted steel plate and is possibly associated with the water pumping activities of the Railways Department.\nHeritage listing.\nMalanda Falls Swimming Pool was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 5 February 2010 having satisfied the following criteria.\nThe place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history.\nMalanda Falls Swimming Pool demonstrates the evolution of tourism in North Queensland as an important example of how the Far North has utilised the natural environment to promote tourism in the region. Initially a swimming hole for locals, improvements to the site, such as terracing and gardens, transformed Malanda Falls from a natural waterhole to a more structured recreation area and swimming pool and since the 1930s has been a popular tourist destination.\nThe place is important because of its aesthetic significance.\nMalanda Falls Swimming Pool is valued for its aesthetic qualities and has been recognised in tourism photographs and literature since the 1920s as a picturesque destination that forms part of Far North Queensland's waterfall and picnic circuit. The manicured swimming hole is surrounded by terraced gardens and dense rainforest. Water tumbles over a basalt rock face into a structured pool below, evoking a strong sense of tranquillity and peace."

        "text": "Philip Johnson (born September 11, 1964) is a former professional tennis player from the United States.\nBiography.\nJohnson, the son of a preacher, is originally from the small Georgia town of Tunnel Hill, in the mountains near the Tennessee border. He was a Georgian state champion as a junior and the top ranked 16s player in 1981.\nSmall in stature, Johnson learned to hit the ball with both hands and throughout his career used two-handed shots for both forehands and backhands.\nIn his second year at the University of Georgia he was a member of the 1985 NCAA Division I championship winning team, which was their first national title. His win over UCLA's Brett Greenwood in the tournament final secured the trophy. He was an All-American in 1986, then again when the University of Georgia won another team title in 1987, a year in which he also made it to number two in the singles rankings and earned selection for the USTA Junior Davis Cup team. On the professional tour he won two Challenger titles in the 1987 season, in back to back tournaments in South Africa, at Bloemfontein and Durban. \nOn both of his main draw appearances at the US Open he met Andre Agassi. The first occasion was in 1988 when he made it through qualifying, then had to face the then world number four in the first round. He managed to take Agassi to a tiebreak in the opening set but still lost in three. At the 1989 US Open he again entered the draw as a qualifier but on this occasion got past his first round opponent, with a straight sets win over Cássio Motta. He also won his second round match over Sweden's Anders Järryd, who had to retire hurt early in the second set, after losing the first. It was then, in the third round, that Johnson came up against Agassi, a match he lost in straight sets.\nHis best win on the Grand Prix/ATP tour came at the 1989 U.S. Pro Championships in Boston, where he upset a top ten player, Alberto Mancini, to make the round of 16. He had lost in qualifying and only got in the tournament as a lucky loser, but was able to defeat the third seeded Argentine 7–6, 6–2.\nFollowing his playing career he worked for many years as a teaching professional at the Hixson Racquet Club in Chattanooga, Tennessee. \nSince 2003 he has been the head coach of the tennis program at Baylor."

The club was founded in 1965 as Körfuknattleiksfélag Ísafjarðar and held that name until it merged with newly founded Íþróttafélagið Vestri multi-sport club in 2016 and became its basketball department.\nHistory.\nThe club was founded in 1965 as \"Körfuknattleiksfélag Ísafjarðar\" (KFÍ).\nIn March 1983, KFÍ finished first in its group in 2. deild karla and played Laugdælir, Breiðablik and Íþróttafélag Menntaskólans á Egilsstöðum (ÍME) in they playoffs for the 2. deild championship and promotion to 1. deild karla. According to the rules at the time, each team would play the other three once and the team with the best win–loss record would be crowned champions. KFÍ lost its first game to Breiðablik, 79–76, despite 29 points from Guðjón Már Þorsteinsson and 21 points from Jón Oddsson. In the second game, against Laugdælir, KFÍ scored the last 4 points of the game, winning 79–76, with Kristinn Kristjánsson scoring 23 points, Jón Oddsson 17 points and Guðjón Már Þorsteinsson 16 points. In the final game, KFÍ defeated ÍME 91–70. Both Breiðablik and Laugdælir also won two out of three games, tied with KFÍ. As the rules did not count for any tie-breakers, the three teams were slated to meet again to decide the winner. During the second try, KFÍ lost to Breiðablik in the first game, 78–77, but won Laugdælir in the second game 79–76. Laugdælir however won Breiðablik leaving the teams again tied, thus meaning that a third playoff would be held to decide the winner. During the third playoff, KFÍ won Breiðablik but lost to Laugdælir. As Breiðablik won Laugdælir the teams were once again tied. Prior to the fourth playoffs, the Icelandic Basketball Federation decided that if the teams would once again finish tied, the team with the best scoring record would finish first. The fourth playoff was held from 30 April to 2 May and there Laugdælir won both KFÍ and Breiðablik convincingly and were crowned 2. deild karla champions.\nIn 1994, the team won the 2. deild karla playoffs, which was held jointly in Ísafjörður and Bolungarvík, after defeating Þór Þorlákshöfn 75–48, and was promoted to 1. deild karla.\nOn 17 October 1999, KFÍ won Skallagrímur, 129–132, in a game that went into four overtimes. It was the longest Úrvalsdeild karla game ever played in Iceland. Clifton Bush set a then record by playing 59 minutes in the game. It has since been broken by Hörður Axel Vilhjálmsson.\nIn 2016, KFÍ merged into Íþróttafélagið Vestri and became its basketball sub-division.\nOn 16 December 2018, while playing in the second-tier 1. deild karla, it knocked out top-tier Haukar in the Final 16 of the Icelandic Cup. It was the only team outside the top-tier Úrvalsdeild to appear in the Final 8 of the cup.\nIn June 2021, Vestri defeated Hamar in the 1. deild promotion finals and achieved promotion to the Úrvalsdeild.\nHead coaches.\nMen's head coaches:\nTrophies and awards.\nAwards.\nÚrvalsdeild Men's Domestic All-First Team\nÚrvalsdeild Men's Young Player of the Year\nÚrvalsdeild Men's Foreign Player of the Year\nReserve team.\nVestri has a men's reserve team that plays in the amateur level Icelandic 4th-tier 3. deild karla, called Vestri-b and nicknamed Flaggskipið (English: The Flagship). In 2018 it was the runner-up to the 3. deild championship."

After the war, he held the national men's title four times, and the doubles title six time. McKenzie, John Barry and Jeff Robson formed the 1947 New Zealand Davis Cup team, and they travelled to Europe by container ship. Their training on the deck of the freighter came to an end when they lost all their tennis balls overboard. The team was arrested during the journey as there were problems with their documentation. One of McKenzie's more notable appearances resulted on this journey when he turned around a 2 nil lead by Norway into a 3 to 2 win by his team in the 1947 Davis Cup. He played the Wimbledon Championships that year and was beaten by Enrique Morea from Argentina in the second round. McKenzie was New Zealand's best player in the 1950s."

        "title": "Indiana High School Rugby",
        "text": "Indiana has become one of the premiere states for high school rugby, with the boys' top league, the Super League, crowned the 2014 toughest high school league. Indiana teams have claimed multiple national and regional championships. At the start of the 2016 season, there were approximately fifty boys teams and fifteen girls teams competing in Indiana. The fifty boys teams were organized into four programs in the Super League, eight in Division 1, twelve in Division 2, and one developmental side. In addition to varsity competition, many programs also contest in junior varsity and developmental competitions, allowing programs to put forth multiple teams.\nGovernance.\nUnlike most high school sports in Indiana, governed by the Indiana High School Athletic Association, rugby in Indiana is governed by the Indiana Youth Rugby Foundation, Inc., which was formed in 1999 to replace the Indiana Youth Rugby Association, Inc. (1990–1999). The foundation operates under the brand Rugby Indiana and is a 501(c)(3) charitable non-profit corporation that operates outside the governing structure of the Indiana Rugby Football Union. Rugby Indiana's stated vision is:\nTop performing teams may also compete in a regional competition governed by the Midwest Rugby Football Union and a national invitational competition. These competitions, unlike Indiana state-level competition, make a distinction between whether teams are composed of players drawn from a single school or a club program open to multiple student bodies.\nPlay and participation.\nAs Allyn Freeman explained in an article for RugbyToday.com, \"America's high schools represented the last place of expansion\" for domestic rugby. Although slow to catch on, rugby at the high school level has exploded in growth since the close of the twentieth century. From 2008 to 2013, rugby participation grew by 81% in the United States, while participation in American football fell 21.1% in the same span. In 2014, participation reached 1.2 million, making rugby the fastest growing sport in the United States. As of 2011, Indiana Rugby boasted 1,227 players at the high school level (902 boys, 325 girls).\nUnlike senior level clubs, which play two forty-minute halves, youth rugby in the United States is capped below the traditional eighty-minute match. In Indiana, matches are scheduled for two thirty-minute halves, with players not allowed to participate in more than ninety minutes of scheduled match time in a single day. In competitions in which teams compete in multiple matches, the total length of the match is truncated to comport with the ninety-minute daily cap, thus, the matches are contested at two halves each of 22.5 minutes in duration. Matches consist of fifteen players on the field for each team along with eight reserves on the bench (23 total). Matches will end in a draw if level at the end of full-time unless in a championship competition. In a championship competition, if the match is level at full-time, an additional ten-minute sudden death period is played. If the match remains level after sudden death, then the outcome is decided on drop kicks. If multiple matches are to be contested in a single day, the sudden death period is foregone. Coed play at the high school level is not permitted. The coed prohibition was tested in May 2001 by the Mishawaka High School boys squads' attempt to include Nicole Kodba in its playoff lineup. Despite arguments from her coach and a community petition, Kodba was not allowed to compete for the boys team. The ruling was controversial and drew critics from among the rugby coaching ranks.\nRugby Indiana's season is broken into three different phases: a competitive season from March through June, a select side season (akin to all-star teams) from June through July, and a fall sevens season from September through October. Based upon team participation, competition is held across a divisional and conference structure. At the top of the boys' competition is the Super League, comprising four teams. The next tier is Division 1 which divides eight teams among a north and south conference. In addition to the typical varsity competition, both Division 1 and the Super League hold a junior varsity competition that competes for a state championship. Below Division 1 is Division 2, which presently includes twelve teams split into north and south conferences. At times, Rugby Indiana has also conducted a developmental league to aid new programs. When participation is sufficient, the girls competition is broken into two divisions. In 2016, only a single division was used for girls rugby spread across north and south conferences of unequal numbers.\nIn order for players to compete, they must be registered both with Rugby Indiana and USA Rugby. Players must also not have reached nineteen years of age prior to September 1. Girls in the 8th grade who are at least 14 years of age may, at the head coach's discretion, compete on a high school team. Players must be enrolled in high school, enrolled in a GED program, or meet the standards of Indiana home school requirements. Players are also required to attend at least four practices with coached supervised tackling prior to participation in a sanctioned match. Players are also required to hold amateur status.\nBoys Championships.\nSuper League.\nIn 2014, four perennial powerhouse teams formed a new top tier, supplanting Division 1 as the highest tier. The original four teams forming the Super League were Brownsburg, the Royal Irish Rugby Club based out Cathedral and Bishop Chatard, Notre Dame de La Salette of Georgetown, Illinois, and Penn. Each team has reached tremendous heights on the national stage: the Royal Irish have claimed four national titles (2012, 2014, 2015, 2017), Brownsburg claimed the 2005 Tier II national championship, and both Penn and La Salette have reached the national finals. After the 2014 season, this prolonged success led Goff Rugby Report to declare the Indiana Super League the toughest high school league in the United States. In 2017, Notre Dame de La Salette began to compete in Illinois, leaving the four-team super league structure missing a fourth team. The Super League was expanded to nine teams split into two divisions. In the North Division were Bishop Dwenger, Carroll, Culver, and Penn. In the South Division were Brownsburg, Fishers, Hamilton Southeast, Royal Irish, and St. Xavier. At seasons end, Royal Irish, fresh off a national championship, would edge Penn for the Super League title. The restructured competition also introduced the Challenge Cup as a consolation competition at the state playoffs. In 2019, the Super League contracted to seven teams with St. Xavier and Hamilton Southeastern dropping to Division 1.\nDivision 1.\nIn the spring of 1990, the Indiana Youth Rugby Association was formed with teams drawn from the Indianapolis area and spearheaded by \"members and alumni of the Indianapolis Rugby Football Club[.]\" Falling below the target of eight teams and 200 players, the inaugural season drew more than 100 players and produced five teams drawn from students of Scencina-Howe-Warren Central, Chatard, North Central, Lawrence Central and the Boys’ School. The teams competed in a seven-game schedule culminating in a playoff to crown a state champion. With Lawrence Central's victory in what would become the Division 1 state championship, the school was awarded both the inaugural state title and an Indianapolis city championship. By 2003, participation had expanded to 24 boys teams and 12 girls teams statewide.\nJunior Varsity.\nHistorically, top-level rugby teams in Indiana would commit a B-side to playing in Division 2. In 2012, a formal Junior Varsity championship was implemented. It was abandoned following the 2016 season.\nFall 7s Championships.\nFollowing the induction of the shortcode of Rugby Union, known as Rugby sevens, into the 2016 Summer Olympics, Rugby Indiana added a high school fall 7s competition to augment its XVs spring competitions.

        "text": "Scott Barrow (born 28 June 1980 in St. Helens, England) is a former rugby union player and now coach. He played for Glasgow Warriors and Leeds Carnegie at the Centre position. Barrow previously also played rugby league for St.Helens and Great Britain Under 19s.\nRugby League.\nBarrow first joined amateur rugby league side Blackbrook A.R.L.F.C. and then in 1997 he joined professional side St. Helens. He captained the Great Britain Under 19 side.\nHe was part of the winning St. Helens squad in the 2000 Super League Grand Final although he did not play in the match.\nRugby Union.\nScott then switched code to play rugby union. In 2000, he signed with Worcester Warriors then playing in National League Division One.\nHe then moved to Orrell after a season and a half with Worcester, at a time when Orrell's experiment with professionalism had ended.\nIn 2004, Barrow left Orrell to join Rotherham but unfortunately at the time due to the club's finances he had to look elsewhere to try and secure professional rugby.\nIn six weeks both Orrell and Rotherham had gone bust. Barrow stated that he felt he should have turned down Orrell and stayed with Worcester Warriors. However his friend Andy Craig previously of Orrell had secured a place with Glasgow Warriors and through him Scott secured a trial at the Scottish club.\nGlasgow Warriors.\nImpressing in two pre-season games with Glasgow Warriors secured Scott a place in the provincial side. He played 4 seasons for the Warriors, being capped 58 times for the club at competitive level.\nWhen not involved with the Warriors he played for Aberdeen GSFP RFC and Glasgow Hutchesons Aloysians.\nA favourite with the Warriors fans the 'Warrior Nation' kept faith with Scott through a number of injuries. Barrow stated: \"I also want to thank the fans for their support during my time here, particularly this season. The Saracens game and the Edinburgh match were great - you can't ask any more from fans - they were outstanding. We need to make it like that for every game.\"\nScotland selection dashed.\nAfter 4 years in Scotland Barrow exceeded the residence requirements to play for Scotland. He was called up to the Scotland A squad for the Churchill Cup in 2008. A delighted Barrow said: \"I'm really made up about being in the Scotland A squad. I qualified for Scotland around August last year and I thought if I could get a few starts for Glasgow and play well I might get a chance in the A squad or Test squad.\"\nHe joined Leeds Carnegie in 2008 but this move heartbreakingly scuppered his Scotland A selection. He had just sold his house in Scotland to Warriors teammate Bernardo Stortoni and was staying in rented accommodation with Graeme Morrison in Scotland while sorting out his move south and awaiting on his Scotland A cap. However World Rugby did not accept his Scottish rented address and he thus failed on residence requirements to qualify for Scotland! Barrow stated: If I'd known about this ruling I wouldn't have sold Bernie my home until after I'd toured. But it's not to be. My hopes of playing for Scotland are dead and buried now.\"\nBack to England.\nBarrow was with Leeds for four years till 2012. He helped Leeds stay in the Premiership in 2010 but the next year they were relegated; one of Barrow's worst moments. He then signed for Fylde Rugby Club till 2014.\nCoaching.\nHe has moved into coaching with King's School, Macclesfield from 2012 and also with Sandbach RUFC from 2014."

        "title": "List of NSW Central Coast Rugby League First Grade Premiers",
        "text": "This is a list of the winners of First Grade Rugby League Premiership competitions held on the Central Coast of New South Wales, Australia.\nThe current competition is conducted under the auspices of the Central Coast Division Rugby League, an affiliate of NSW Country Rugby League and the New South Wales Rugby League.\nFirst Grade Premiers.\nBackground.\nFootball matches under Rugby Union rules were played by clubs from Gosford, Ourimbah and Wyong in the years 1905, 1906 and 1907. From 1908 to 1911, Wyong entered a team in the Newcastle Rugby Union competitions.\nDuring 1911 Gosford Football Club played both Union and League matches. Rugby League teams from the NSWRFL lower grade competitions visited and played against Gosford: Balmain on July 15 and South Sydney Federal on September 2.\nWyong joined the Newcastle Rugby League competition in 1912, competing in Second Grade that season and in 1913 and 1914.\n1915 to 1936.\nThe first Rugby League association on the Central Coast was inaugurated in May 1915. Competition matches were played in June. Ourimbah defeated Erina in a Final on August 29. The other teams competing were Matcham, Wyong and Yarramalong.\nNo competition took place in 1916 or 1917 and in 1918 only a few matches were played.\nCompetition Rugby League was revived in 1919. The season format was to conduct a premiership competition, in which all teams played the same number of matches, followed by a knock-out. From 1920 until 1932, the Knock-Out involved all teams. \nGaps in the table in 1927 and 1929 are due to the limited availability of issues of the \"Gosford Times\" in those years. A list of previous winners was, however, published in the \"Wyong Advocate\" in 1932.\nIn 1928 the Association decided to hold only a Second Grade competition. Ourimbah and Wyong fielded two teams. Gosford entered their First Grade team in the North Sydney Juniors competition and their Second Grade competed in the local competition. In 1931, however, a newspaper article stated that Wyong had won the last four first grade competitions. This suggests that the local competition of 1928 was elevated to First Grade status.\nIn 1933 Kincumber won a Knock-Out Final but premiers Morisset were able to challenge them in a Grand Final.\nIn 1934 a Club Competition was conducted and given prominence. Points from both grades counted, though first grade points were worth double (i.e. four points for a win). Wyong and Morisset initially finished level on 59 Club Championship points.\nA play-off final was held, which Morisset won. However, on appeal to the parent body, Newcastle Rugby League, a protest that the local association had dismissed was overturned. Wyong were awarded an additional four points for a first grade game they had lost, in which Ourimbah fielded an unregistered player.\nEarlier in 1934 Woy Woy defeated a depleted Ourimbah team by 102 to nil in a First Grade match.\n1937 to 1939.\nIn 1932 Gosford Football Club began playing challenge matches, separate from the competition matches played on Saturdays. The format was to invite teams from outside the district to play matches at Gosford Showground. The team that defeated Gosford by the biggest margin was invited back at the end of the season to play a grand final for a trophy cup.\nWoy Woy left the local competition and adopted this format in 1935, arranging their own challenge matches and grand final each year until 1939. In 1937 they ran the challenge in two grades, with the B grade team named Ettalong. In 1939, both grade teams in the Woy Woy challenge cup were named Ettalong.\nCompetition in a league format did not take place between 1937 and 1939. A meeting of the Erina Shire Rugby Football League in May 1937 decided to suspend the competition, attributing to a decline of interest in Saturday football to a rise in SP betting. The lodgement of protests had become common in the mid 1930s and this may have also contributed.\nGosford's 1939 Challenge Cup Grand Final was postponed due to the outbreak of war.\n1940 to 1946.\nChallenge Cup matches were played in 1940 mostly by Gosford and Ourimbah. Wyong club was revived and played a few games. Ettalong played at least one match, visiting Ourimbah on May 19.\nJust seven issues of the \"Gosford Times\" are available for the seven years, 1941 to 1948, so information on Central Coast football during this time is limited. Ourimbah and Woy Woy hosted challenge matches in 1941. Rugby League in the years 1942 to 1944 may have been restricted to school football – Gosford High School hosted Randwick in July 1943.\nWyong competed in the Newcastle Third Grade competition in 1945, along with ten other teams. They made the semi-finals, playing at Newcastle Sports Ground on August 25, but were beaten, 14 to 8, by Newcastle's Northern Suburbs club.\nThe following year, 1946, Wyong fielded two grade sides in a Southern Newcastle competition. Two rounds of matches were played against the four other competitors. Wyong's A grade team finished third, between finalists Belmont and Morisset, and Cardiff and Lake Macquarie. In B grade, Wyong upset minor premiers Belmont in the final, prompting a Grand Final the following week.\nOn September 1, 1946 Ourimbah won Gosford's Challenge Cup, by 6 to 3, but lost their own Cup grand finals the following Sunday, being beaten 19 to 8 by BHP Newcastle in A grade, and 18 to nil by Central Newcastle's Under 18 team in B grade.\n1947 to 2009.\nIn February 1947 an annual meeting of the Brisbane Water Rugby League Football Association elected office bearers. By early April, a draw was published, now under the name Central Coast Rugby League Football Association. The five clubs in the 1947 competition were Morisset, Ourimbah, The Entrance, Woy Woy and Wyong. Gosford continued to run their challenge cup in 1947 but joined the local league in 1948. Erina club was formed to enter the 1949 competition. Morisset, however, did not participate in 1949.\nThe format involved the completion of a league of regular season matches to determine the minor premier. The top four teams were then to play in a final series to determine the major premier. Initially, if the minor premier was beaten in either their semi-final or the final, they had a right to challenge the winner of the final in a Grand Final.\nFrom 1950 to 1966, the Grades were more commonly referred to as A, B, C and D.\nC and D grades were intended for the development of younger players. This was formalised in 1967 when they became and Under 17 competitions. The first in a number of changes to the age limits occurred in the following season, 1968.\nIn 1976, Third Grade was replaced by both an and a Second Division competition. The Second Division competition was played on Saturdays, while the five other grades continued to be played on Sundays. The second division had a mix of teams from the district clubs, as well as Davistown, Toukley, Milson Island and Munmorah.\n became in 1977. Third Grade returned in 1978 and ran, but for a two-year gap in the early 1980s, until 1999. Second Division ran until 2005. In 2009, an competition was held.\nIn 2001, The Entrance and Woy Woy finished the regular season on equal points. Despite The Entrance having the superior points difference, Woy Woy were declared winners in the minor premiership by virtue of winning the major semi-final.\nClubs.\nToronto participated from 1954 to 1959. Rathmines in 1955 and South Lakes in 1958. Combined Wyong-Morisset teams competed in 1957, with Wyong dropping out in 1958 before reorganising and returning in 1960. Umina first entered teams in 1964. Mount Penang fielded Under 18 teams from 1969 to 1975. Saint Edwards College fielded Under 16 teams in 1971, 1972 and 1974. Terrigal-Wamberal became the eighth district club in 1976 and Toukley the ninth in 1979. Munmorah fielded first grade teams in 1981 and 1982, but dropped back to second division in 1983.\nThe 1990s saw a number of changes to participation in the First Grade competition. Munmorah returned in 1992, were renamed as Northern Lakes in 1994 but dropped out in 1998. Berkeley Vale joined in 1995. Toukley dropped back to Second Division in 1995. Umina were unable to field a senior team in the three seasons between 1996 and 1998. Gosford's last season in First Grade was 1999.\nIn 2003, The Entrance, Erina, Ourimbah and Woy Woy entered teams in the Jim Beam Cup. This meant that their second side participated in the CCDRL First Grade competition. Woy Woy played two seasons, Ourimbah two and a half (withdrawing mid-season in 2005) and Erina five. The Entrance were the most successful of the four Central Coast clubs, winning three premierships (2003, 2007 &amp; 2014) in two stints (2003-2007 and 2010-2014). Also in 2003, Wyong joined the Newcastle competition and fielded teams in both competitions until 2006.\nIn 2004, the Kincumber Colts entered First Grade and Northern Lakes and Umina returned, after gaps of six and one seasons, respectively. With Second Division discontinued in 2006, Central Wyong and Toukley entered First Grade.\n2010 to Present.\nDuring this period First Grade, Reserve Grade, Open Age and youth competitions have been held. The number and ages in the youth competitions have varied. Since 2014, the senior body has run Under 19s and the junior body Under 17s.\nA ladies league tag competition commenced in 2015 and was won by Kincumber. That competition and its teams are included in the number of grades and teams in this table.\nIn 2012, two Under 18 competitions were held, Under 18/1s was won by The Entrance and Under 18/2s was won by Kincumber."

        "text": "The 1972 Kentucky Derby was the 98th running of the Kentucky Derby. The race took place on May 6, 1972, with 130,564 people in attendance.\n The history behind the Run for the Roses goes on for many years. The Kentucky Derby is known to be \"the most exciting 2 minutes in sports.\" “When the famers’ Almanac celebrated its 57th anniversary in 1875. Plans were being made to open the now legendary Churchill Downs horse racecourse in Louisville, Kentucky, and the run the very first Kentucky Derby, today the Kentucky Derby run in May on the first Saturday. In the beginning Churchill didn't make any money, In 1902 a marketing genius named Colonel J. \"Matt\" Winn, was chosen by a local businessman to take the helm of the Downs and have it turn to a profit. It went through, the Kentucky Derbies where hoping at least that was the goal, and he then died in 1949. Winn loved his job, which was and still is paid off. Winn's successful marketing eventually created “several Derby rituals that have become essential parts of the event. The winners are presented with a gold trophy and a garland of roses. Before the race begins, we, all join in the sinning of, “My Old Kentucky Home.” Winn picked the first Saturday in May because he wanted a good chance for nice weather for Kentucky; “Today the public still enjoys many Derby traditions including sipping mint juleps and enjoying “hot browns” wearing fancy hats, eating slices of derby-pie as they watched the race. The “Run for The Roses” continues to be uniquely American tradition that is seen by millions of people worldwide.” \nRon Turcotte was the winning jockey of the 1972 Belmont Stakes Race and the U.S. Triple Crown in 1973. Turcotte’s career started in “Toronto as a hot walker for E.P Taylor’s Winfield’s farm in 1960.” He gained praise in result of his victory with Tom Rolfe in the 1965 Preakness Stakes. In 1973 Turcotte internationally famous when he rode secretariat, to win the first Triple Crown in 25 years. “Turcotte was North America’s leading stakes- winning jockey in 1972–1973.” He was the first jockey to win back-to-back Kentucky Derbies. This hasn't happened since Jimmy Winkfield in 1902 he “was the first jockey to have won five out of six consecutive Triple Crown Races. Eventually he was voted “the prestigious George Woolf Memorial Jockey Award.” He was “First Thoroughbred racing ever to be appointed a member of the order of Canada. “Turcotte’s career ended in 1978 following a tumble of his horse, Flag of Leyte Gulf at the starts of a race at Belmont Park. He suffered injuries that resulted in Paraplegia.” He was put into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame, and he was also voted into the New Brunswick Sports Hall of Fame in 1979 he made it into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame. In 1984 he was the first recipient of the Avelino Gomez Memorial Award. The annual given rewards the jockey who is Canadian born raised or even a regular country who made significant contributions to this sport. “In 2015, a statue of secretariat and Turcotte crossing the finish line at Belmont Stakes was unveiled in grand falls New Brunswick, The hometown of Turcotte.\n “Riva Ridge was a thoroughbred racehorse, The winner of the Kentucky Derby and Belmont Stakes in 1972.” Riva was often remembered as a simple stablemate of Secretariat. He won seventeen out of his thirty starts and two championships. The American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse in 71’and The American Older Male Horse in 73’. It was said that “Riva Ridge’s success was largely responsible for saving Meadow Stable from financial ruin. “Riva Ridge and his sire were owned and bred by the Meadow Stable of Christopher Chenery in Doswell Virginia.” The famous Riva Ridge got his name from Penny, Chenery's daughter and John Tweedy her husband. This was in honor of “their favorite ski run at vail, Colorado. In 1971, there was a financial struggle at Meadow Stable. Chenery eventually became very sick and was enabled to keep going. Hs daughter Penny wanted to save it, whereas for her sibling’s they did not, they wanted to sell it. After seeing how successful Riva Ridge was as the two-year-old they decided to keep it. At the ages of two and four Riva Ridge was the winner of the Eclipse Award. Riva Ridge’s main jockey was Ron Turcotte. Some would describe Riva Ridge as “very timid and unassuming.” They said he was the horse who “ran away from other horses.” While racing he gained the nickname “Old Pea Head.” I choose to use these sources because the wiki stub only talks about when it took place, where it took place, how many were there in attendance, the winning horse and jockey and a list of those who participated in the race. I felt this stub could use these sources to expand upon this historic event and a little background information about the winning jockey Ron Turcotte and the winning horse Riva Ridge."

        "text": "Climbing Silver (棒銀 \"bōgin\", literally \"pole-silver\") is a shogi strategy.\nClimbing Silver involves advancing a silver upward along with an advanced or dropped pawn supported by the rook aiming to break through the opponent's camp on their bishop's side.\nMany different Static Rook shogi openings include a Climbing Silver component. For instance, Climbing Silver can be played as part of Double Wing Attack, Fortress, or Bishop Exchange openings. (However, there are other variants of these openings that don't include Climbing Silver.) Climbing Silver can also be used against Ranging Rook opponents as well.\nDiagonal Climbing Silver or Oblique Climbing Silver (斜め棒銀 \"naname bōgin\") is a Climbing Silver attack involving the left silver which moves diagonally from its starting position on 7i to attack on the third or second files. This type of Climbing Silver is typical in Static Rook vs Ranging Rook games.\nPositioning.\nIn the adjacent diagrams, the Black's silver advances to rank 5.\nOnce the silver has reached the e file (S-15 in the adjacent diagram), Black can attempt to attack White's bishop pawn at 23 by advancing their pawn (P-24). White can capture Black's pawn, but the silver can recapture White's pawn. Because White did not properly defend their bishop's head here, White's camp is somewhat weaker and more susceptible to subsequent attacks from Black.\nSimilarly, it's also possible to play Climbing Silver when Black has no pawn on the second file. Here the silver can climb to the empty 25 square. And, if there's a pawn in hand, then that pawn can be dropped to 24.\nIn the board diagram to the right, the Black's silver has successfully climbed to rank 5 on the first file (15). \nA subsequent attack by Black, for example, could aim to sacrifice this silver in order to remove White's lance and then drop a dangling pawn within White's camp that threatens to promote.\nClimbing Silver formations may be used with several different Static Rook openings such as Fortress, Double Wing, and Bishop Exchange as well as Ranging Rook openings such as Fourth File Rook."

        "title": "Skeleton Tree",
        "text": "Skeleton Tree is the sixteenth studio album by Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds. It was released on 9 September 2016 on Bad Seed Ltd. A follow-up to the band's critically acclaimed album \"Push the Sky Away\" (2013), \"Skeleton Tree\" was recorded over 18 months at Retreat Recording Studios in Brighton, La Frette Studios in La Frette-sur-Seine and Air Studios in London. It was produced by Nick Cave, Warren Ellis and Nick Launay. During the sessions, Cave's 15-year-old son, Arthur, died from an accidental fall. Most of the album had been written at the time of Cave's son's death, but several lyrics were amended by Cave during subsequent recording sessions and feature themes of death, loss, and personal grief.\n\"Skeleton Tree\"s minimal production and \"less polished\" sound incorporates elements of electronica and ambient music and, like \"Push the Sky Away\", features extensive use of synthesizers, drum machines and loops. Several songs on the album utilise avant-garde techniques, including the use of dissonant musical elements and non-standard song structures. Cave's allegorical and often-improvised lyrics have also been noted to be less narrative and character-based than on previous Bad Seeds albums.\n\"One More Time with Feeling\", a documentary film about the aftermath of Cave's son's death and the recording process of \"Skeleton Tree\", accompanied the album's release. Directed by Andrew Dominik, the film received a limited release and was conceived by Cave to explain the context and themes of \"Skeleton Tree\" without conducting interviews with the media. Both the film and the album received widespread critical acclaim. It was the second of only two albums by the band to enter the U.S. Top 30, reaching 27, their highest ranking there to date. \nRecording.\n\"Skeleton Tree\" was recorded over several sessions from late 2014 to early 2016, with Nick Cave and Warren Ellis producing the album; Cave financed the recording sessions himself. Initial recording began at Retreat Recording Studios in Brighton, England, in late 2014, with Kevin Paul as the main recording engineer. \nOn July 15, 2015, near the end of the sessions, Cave's 15-year-old son Arthur died after falling from the nearby Ovingdean Gap. Cave and Ellis returned to the studio two weeks later to review the material recorded for \"Skeleton Tree\". Most of the basic tracks for each song and a majority of Cave's vocals were completed by this time. The album's sessions then resumed at La Frette Studios in La Frette-sur-Seine, France, in autumn 2015, with Nick Launay engineering and co-producing the sessions. Final overdubs for \"Skeleton Tree\" were recorded at Air Studios in London, with engineers Kevin Paul and Jake Jackson, in early 2016. Several performances from the final recording sessions were shot for the album's accompanying documentary film \"One More Time with Feeling\", directed by Andrew Dominik.\nComposition.\nSeveral publications have noted \"Skeleton Tree\"s lyrical themes of loss and death, particularly in relation to the death of Cave's son Arthur. The majority of the songs on the album were written prior to Arthur's death. However, some lyrics—such as the opening lines to \"Jesus Alone\"—have been regarded as \"prophetic\" in the wake of his death. Several lyrics were \"semi-improvised\" in subsequent recording sessions as Cave had expressed a desire to move on from \"narrative-based songs\", claiming he had \"lost faith\" in them.\n\"Skeleton Tree\"s lyrics are noted as being often allegorical and \"never directly [address]\" the event of Arthur's death. \"Esquire\" observed how the album's lyrics are \"less explicitly about Arthur's death and more about the ripple effects of that sort of catastrophe\" on Cave and his family, \"and the way everyone else finds their way back\"; \"Billboard\" described the album's lyrics as \"freeform elegies … tapping into the unconscious.\" \"Consequence of Sound\" detailed the \"radical shift\" in Cave's lyrics on \"Skeleton Tree\", noting that they \"[are] no longer telling elaborate stories full of intricately felt characters\" like the Bad Seeds' previous material and that Cave had \"unlock[ed] a more primal type of storytelling, something even more raw, deep, and dark\". Cave commissioned Andrew Dominik to direct \"One More Time with Feeling\"—in which Cave discusses the album's writing and recording process after Arthur's death—so that he could address the album's context without conducting interviews with the media.\n\"Skeleton Tree\"s sound has been observed as \"far more stripped-down\" than the Bad Seeds' earlier albums and features \"less polished\" production. The album features components of multiple genres and has been described generally as an avant-garde album. Several songs contain dissonant musical elements—including the use of unresolved chords, drones, atonality, noise, and vocal melodies which do not conform to the songs' time signatures. Additionally, most of the songs' structures do not follow the standard verse-chorus-verse form. \"Skeleton Tree\" has been also described as featuring elements of electronica—including use of synthesizers, drum machines and shuffled beats. The album's \"sparse and restrained\" arrangements, as well as its use of loops and downtempo rhythms, have been cited by several critics as reminiscent of ambient music.\nPackaging.\n\"Skeleton Tree\"s sleeve design was created by the Hingston Studio, an independent creative agency based in London; Tom Hingston, the agency's creative director, had previously designed the sleeve and cover art for \"Push the Sky Away\". The front-cover artwork features a solid black background, with the band name and album title in monospace-style green font in the bottom-left centre. \"Skeleton Tree\"s interior liner notes, as well as the text on the discs, are presented in the same typeface. A black-and-white photograph of Cave from the album's recording sessions, depicting him writing in a notebook while seated at a grand piano, is featured in the booklet; it was shot by German cinematographer and photographer Alwin Küchler.\nSeveral publications have commented on the minimalist design of \"Skeleton Tree\", regarding it as a visual equivalent to the album's themes. \"Néoprisme\", a French design magazine, described the choice use of black as \"the colour of eternal mourning\" and reminiscent of how the album was \"stained black due to the circumstance.\" \"Paste\" referred to \"Skeleton Tree\"s cover art as \"stark\" and \"up front … leaving little to the imagination\" and said it symbolised Cave \"mak[ing] it plain to listeners that he's still mourning\".\nRelease.\n\"Skeleton Tree\" was released worldwide on 9 September 2016 on Bad Seed Ltd,\nunder licence to Kobalt Label Services. It was issued on CD, LP and across all digital \nstreaming and download platforms. The album was announced three months before its release, and a one-and-a-half-minute trailer for both \"Skeleton Tree\" and Andrew Dominik's documentary film \"One More Time with Feeling\" was released in August. The album's track listing was confirmed two weeks later.\nA week prior to \"Skeleton Tree\"s release the opening track from the album, \"Jesus Alone\", was released as a single. A music video directed by Dominik accompanied the release and featured footage from \"One More Time with Feeling\". A second video from \"One More Time with Feeling\", featuring the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds performing \"I Need You\", was released a week later.\n\"One More Time with Feeling\"—featuring in-studio performances by the band and \"accompanied by Cave's intermittent narration and improvised rumination\"—was shot in both black and white and colour and in both 2D and 3D. The film was released in cinemas worldwide on 8 September, the day before \"Skeleton Tree\"s official release. Originally a one-night-only event, additional screenings were added until 11 September due to demand in certain locations. Critical response to \"One More Time with Feeling\" was unanimously positive.\nCommercial performance.\nOn the United Kingdom's mid-week albums chart \"Skeleton Tree\" debuted at number 2, selling 17,600 copies in its first three days of release.\n\"Skeleton Tree\" debuted at number one on the Australian Albums Chart as well as on several international albums charts, including the Belgian Albums Chart in Wallonia, the Danish Albums Chart, the Finnish Albums Chart, the Irish Albums Chart, the Irish Independent Albums Chart, the New Zealand Albums Chart, and the Norwegian Albums Chart.\n\"Skeleton Tree\" became Nick Cave's highest charting album in the United States, debuting at number twenty-seven on the Billboard 200.\nReception.\nCritical response.\nUpon its release \"Skeleton Tree\" received rave reviews from music critics and audiences. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 95, based on 34 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". In a five-out-of-five-star review for the \"London Evening Standard\", John Aizlewood called \"Skeleton Tree\" a \"breathtakingly beautiful, grief-strewn record, sometimes direct, sometimes allegorical\" and praised both the album's \"tender and restrained\" music and Cave's \"more broken and more uncertain\" vocals; Aizlewood said that \"Skeleton Tree\" was a \"staggering achievement, the one for which Nick Cave will always be remembered.\" An early first-listen review in \"the Guardian\" referred to the album as \"unsurprisingly, a very dark record\", but said \"there is also beauty, empathy and love as it veers between bewildered numbness and heartbreaking profundity\". \"The Guardian\"s Dave Simpson likened Cave's \"instinctive howl from the heart and gut\" to Johnny Cashs cover version of Nine Inch Nails \"Hurt\", saying \"the frailties, wounds and vulnerabilities in his voice give the record its strength and humanity\" and summarising it as \"a masterpiece of love and devastation\".\nIn a first listen review, Jess Denham of \"The Independent\" wrote that Cave's \"experience of bereavement is blisteringly undiluted\" and called \"Skeleton Tree\" \"a beautiful, shatteringly visceral portrait of grief\". Writing for \"Rolling Stone\", reviewer Kory Grow referred to Cave as \"the dean of literary gothic song-craft, a master of wordplay, symbolism and irony\" and described how on \"Skeleton Tree\" Cave was \"baring his soul like never before\", adding that the album \"resonates with raw, emotional intensity in a stunning way\". \"NME\" reviewer Barry Nicolson called it a \"masterpiece\" and \"both beautiful and harrowing, hard to listen to but even harder to look away from.\" In a review for AllMusic, Mark Deming was more reserved in his praise, noting that \"the music lacks the dramatic, grand-scale arrangements of Cave's albums of the 21st century\" and that \"the final effect feels more like an author reading over ambient backing tracks than the sort of evocative sounds one might expect\" from the band, but nonetheless concluding that although \"Skeleton Tree\" is a \"tough listen … it's also a powerful and revealing one, and a singular work from a one-of-a-kind artist.\"\n\"Slant Magazine\" writer Jeremy Winograd called \"Skeleton Tree\" \"Cave's darkest, most emotionally devastating work to date\" and said that although it \"may not be Cave's most accessible album, owing both to the experimental nature of much of the music and the fact that its level of emotional rawness makes it a legitimately uncomfortable listen in places, it may very well be his best\"; Wingrod rated the album four-and-a-half-out-of-five stars. \"Clash\" gave \"Skeleton Tree\" a nine-out-of-ten rating, with reviewer Josh Gray praising Cave and Ellis' songwriting and arrangements and summarising the album as \"a stark, beautiful rendering of deep, profound pain.\" Paula Mejia wrote in \"Paste\" that \"\"Skeleton Tree\" strips down embellishments and brings to the forefront sinister bass lines and a synthesizer that will widen the tear in your heart a little more with every note\"; Mejia concluded that \"there's something to be said about \"Skeleton Tree\" and its starkness, which is as familiar as life and death, an elegy, and a hell of a thing to forget\", rating the album nine out of ten. \"Pitchfork\" also gave the album a nine-out-of-ten rating and selected it as the week's \"Best New Music\"; \"I Need You\" was also selected as the week's \"Best New Track\" and was described as \"the stirring core of the Bad Seeds' devastating new album.\"\nPersonnel.\nAll personnel credits adapted from \"Skeleton Tree\"s album notes.\nNick Cave and the Bad Seeds\nAdditional musicians\nTechnical personnel\nArtwork"

        "title": "Israel at the World Baseball Classic",
        "text": "Team Israel has competed in the World Baseball Classic since the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifier round. In 2017 Israel competed at a World Baseball Classic qualifier for the second time, and for the first time qualified for the main tournament.\nPrior to the start of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, ESPN considered Team Israel, ranked 41st in the world, to be the biggest underdog in the tournament, referring to it as the \"Jamaican bobsled team of the WBC\". Israel's odds to win the WBC were 200-1, before the tournament began. As the team began to win games at the WBC, its performance was described variously as a Cinderella story, a \"David and Goliath\" tale, and a baseball version of \"The Mouse That Roared\". Israel beat all three opposing teams in the first round to finish atop the pool, defeating South Korea (ranked # 3 in the world), Chinese Taipei (ranked # 4 in the world; Israel's 15 runs were the most Taiwan had ever given up in a game in World Baseball Classic play), and the Netherlands (ranked # 9 in the world). Israel became the first baseball team to go undefeated in the first round of the WBC’s main draw after entering the main draw by winning in a qualifying round. Team Israel's catcher, Ryan Lavarnway, was named Pool A MVP. Team Israel qualified for the second round; Pool E in Tokyo, Japan, to be played later in March 2017. Furthermore, the team qualified for the 2021 World Baseball Classic.\nIn the first game of the 2017 World Baseball Classic second round, Israel beat Cuba (ranked # 5 in the world). In a rematch of their Pool A game in which Israel prevailed, the Netherlands defeated Israel, giving the team its first loss of the tournament, and then world # 1 Japan beat Israel. Israel finished in third place in Pool E with a 1-2 record, and 4-2 (and sixth) overall in the tournament. Pitcher Josh Zeid was named to the 2017 All-World Baseball Classic team. \nTeam Israel will compete in the 2023 World Baseball Classic in March 12-15, 2023 in Miami, Florida, against Team Puerto Rico, Team Dominican Republic, Team Venezuela, and Team Nicaragua.\nPlayer eligibility.\nUnder WBC rules, any player eligible to be a citizen of a country is entitled to play for that country's baseball team, even if the player has not obtained citizenship. Israel's Law of Return gives anyone with a Jewish parent or grandparent, or who is married to a Jew, the right to return to Israel and to be an Israeli citizen. The WBC rules thus allow non-Israeli citizens of Jewish heritage to play for Team Israel.\nIn 2013, a number of Major League players of Jewish descent, including Ian Kinsler and Kevin Youkilis, publicly expressed interest in playing for Team Israel in the World Baseball Classic. However, while some of the qualifying rounds were played after the conclusion of the 2012 season and included Major League players, Israel's qualifier was played in September 2012, during the Major League season. Without its Major League players, Israel narrowly lost its qualifier to Spain (which had no Major League players at the time and thus was not affected by the scheduling).\nIsrael was put into the same position during the qualifiers for the 2017 tournament. Three of the four qualifiers took place during 2016 spring training, and included Major League players. However, Israel's qualifier took place in September 2016.\nRecord.\nRecord by year.\n&lt;section begin=Record /&gt;\n&lt;section end=Record /&gt;\n2009 tournament bid.\nIsrael applied to participate in the 2009 World Baseball Classic. In 2007, the inaugural season of the Israel Baseball League brought a large interest to the sport in Israel, causing Israel to apply to entry for the tournament. The Israel Association of Baseball (IAB) hoped appearing in the tournament would increase interest in the sport within Israel, in an effort to capitalize on the growing support. Israel had hoped that if the IBL was success they would be able to build a team with Israeli born talent. Marvin Goldklang, head of the IAB, however, talked about eventually having a team made up of Jewish Major Leaguers. Although not accepted in 2009, they were subsequently invited to participate in the newly created qualifying round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic.\n2013 World Baseball Classic.\nIsrael competed in the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifier. The qualifying round was held in September, while the Major League Baseball season still in progress, therefore it could not feature major league players such as those who qualified to play for Team Israel.\nThe team competed in the September 2012 qualifier, in Jupiter, Florida against Spain, France, and South Africa. Israel competed in their first qualifying match for the 2013 tournament on 19 September 2012 and defeated South Africa by a score of 7-3. Nate Freiman had two home runs in the victory. Israel's second qualifying match was against Spain on 21 September 2012, which Israel won 4-2. Nate Freiman once again homered twice for Israel in the victory. Israel's third qualifying match was once again against Spain on 23 September 2012, and lost 9-7 in 10 innings. With the victory Israel was eliminated from the tournament and Spain moved on to the next round. Although Israel had won their first two games they were eliminated due to the tournaments modified double-elimination format. This meant that the final game was winner-take-all.\n2013 qualifier roster.\nThe players who qualified to play on the Israeli team included major leaguers catcher Ryan Lavarnway, first baseman Ike Davis, second basemen Ian Kinsler and Josh Satin, third basemen Kevin Youkilis and Danny Valencia, outfielders Ryan Braun (whose father is Israeli), Sam Fuld, Ryan Kalish, and Gabe Kapler, and pitchers Jason Marquis, Scott Feldman, Craig Breslow, and John Grabow, as well as what were then recent major leaguers catcher Brad Ausmus and pitcher Scott Schoeneweis.\nKinsler said: \"Wow, I would be happy to play for Team Israel... The truth is that if a proposal comes from Team USA to play for them, I will have a very difficult decision to make. Yuk [Kevin Youkilis], Braun [Ryan Braun], and I could make a fantastic team. I am sure that I'll talk it over with Yuk – we always laugh about things like this.\" Outfielder Shawn Green, who retired in 2007, was also eligible inasmuch as he is Jewish, and said in early June 2011 that assuming it works out, it \"would be an honor\" and he \"would love to\" play for Israel in the Classic.\nThe qualifying round was held in September, while the Major League Baseball season was still in progress; therefore, during Qualifiers 1 and 2 it could not feature major league players such as the above ones who qualified to play for Team Israel. The lack of Major League players affected Israel far more than its opponents, none of which had players in the Major Leagues at the time. Kevin Youkilis announced that he would play for the team if it made it past the qualifying round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic.\nThe highest-level players involved in Qualifiers 1 and 2 were minor-league prospects. Team Israel included minor league pitchers Eric Berger (1–0) and Brett Lorin, first baseman Nate Freiman (.417; 4 HR in 12 AB), second baseman Josh Satin (.273), shortstops Jake Lemmerman and Ben Orloff, and outfielders Cody Decker, Adam Greenberg, Ben Guez, Joc Pederson (.308), and Robbie Widlansky. Also, retired former major league All Star Shawn Green played for Israel (.333).\nIn addition to Brad Ausmus as manager, the team's coaches included Shawn Green, Gabe Kapler, and Mark Loretta.\n2017 World Baseball Classic.\nIsrael competed in the 2017 World Baseball Classic, after winning the 4th qualifying round in September 2016. This marked the second time Israel competed at the World Baseball Classic qualifier, and its first time qualifying for the main tournament.\nIsrael's qualifiers took place in MCU Park, Brooklyn, New York, United States against Pakistan, Brazil, and Great Britain. Colorado Rockies coach Jerry Weinstein served as the team's manager. Israel swept all three games of the competition to qualify for the main tournament, first beating Great Britain and Brazil, and then defeating Great Britain 9-1 in the finals.\nWith the win, they advanced to play in South Korea, as the 16th and final team in the WBC. They were in Pool A, playing against South Korea, Taiwan, and the Netherlands.\n2017 qualifier roster.\nTeam Israel for the 2016 qualifying competition was assembled by Peter Kurz (President of the Israel Association of Baseball), with an informal team of baseball scouts and experts of Jewish baseball, including Scott Barancik (\"Jewish Baseball News\") and Ephraim Moxson and Shel Wallman (\"Jewish Sports Review\").\nOn August 15, 2016, it was announced that MLB veteran pitcher Craig Breslow would join the Team Israel pitching staff for the qualifiers. The official roster was released on August 26, 2016. Israel's roster included 20 MLB-affiliated minor leaguers, making up 86% of the team, more than any other team in the qualifiers even before including recent Major Leaguers Breslow (an 11-year MLB veteran), Ike Davis, Josh Satin, catcher Ryan Lavarnway, former 15-year MLB veteran All Star pitcher Jason Marquis, Cody Decker, Nate Freiman, and Josh Zeid. One of Israel's minor leaguers, Ty Kelly, had to withdraw from the qualifier after he was called up to the New York Mets. Additionally, 10 of the Israeli players had reached Triple-A.\nThe team's oldest player was pitcher Shlomo Lipetz, 37, who grew up in Israel and lives in New York. Lipetz is also the only player on the team with no current or past MLB affiliation. Team Israel's youngest player was pitcher Dean Kremer, 20, a Californian drafted by the Dodgers whose parents are Israeli expatriates.\n\"Source:\n2017 qualifier results.\nIsrael, Pakistan, Brazil, and Great Britain played a modified double-elimination format. Israel's schedule was set in a way that they would play the afternoon game on Friday, under any circumstances, in order to avoid the need to play on Shabbat, and the Saturday night game, should Israel need to play, would start after Shabbat was over.\nIsrael beat Great Britain 5-2 in Game One, with RBIs from pinch-hitter/DH Ike Davis and third baseman Cody Decker. In addition, left fielder Rhett Wiseman singled and scored, right fielder Zach Borenstein had an RBI single, and catcher Ryan Lavarnway had three hits. Jason Marquis started and was removed after throwing 41 pitches in order to allow him to return later in the qualifiers. (WBC rules require four days rest after throwing at least 50 pitches.) Josh Zeid struck out six hitters in 3-2/3 innings of relief, and Craig Breslow got the win. Decker said: “I never played on a team with more than three Jews since Little League in Santa Monica.”\nIsrael beat Brazil 1-0 in Game Two, with Decker driving in DH Nate Freiman for the only run of the game. Freiman and shortstop Scott Burcham got the team's other hits. Corey Baker started and gave up one hit in five innings and was pulled after throwing 83 pitches, two fewer than the qualifying round’s single-game limit. Ryan Sherriff, Jared Lakind, and Jeremy Bleich pitched in relief, and Brad Goldberg picked up his second save.\nIsrael defeated Great Britain in the finals 9-1 on September 25, 2016. Starter Jason Marquis struck out five batters while pitching four perfect innings, and Josh Zeid pitched three shutout innings and was credited with the win. The pitching duo did not allow a hit through their 7 innings of play. Center fielder Blake Gailen broke the scoreless tie in the fifth inning with a two-run home run. Ryan Lavarnway and Cody Decker also homered for Israel.\n2017 main World Baseball Classic roster.\nCurrent major leaguers who were not able to play in September 2016 because they were playing in the majors, but who would be eligible to play for Team Israel in March 2017, included former All Stars outfielder Ryan Braun (Milwaukee Brewers; Israeli father), second basemen Ian Kinsler (Detroit Tigers) and Jason Kipnis (Cleveland Indians), and center fielder Joc Pederson (Los Angeles Dodgers). Other major leaguers who would be eligible to play for Team Israel included outfielder Kevin Pillar (Toronto Blue Jays), third baseman/outfielder/first baseman Danny Valencia (Oakland A’s), shortstop/third baseman Alex Bregman (Houston Astros), and pitchers Scott Feldman (Blue Jays), Richard Bleier (New York Yankees), and Jon Moscot (Cincinnati Reds; on the DL at the end of 2016 season).\nIn November 2016 it was announced that Jerry Weinstein would return as head coach. His coaching staff included Tom Gamboa as bench coach, Jerry Narron as third base coach, Nate Fish as first base coach, Andrew Lorraine as pitching coach, Tal Erel as bullpen catcher, and Alon Leichman as bullpen coach. Additional team staff included Barry Weinberg as trainer, Justine Siegal as mental skills coach, and Dan Rootenberg with Yoni Rosenblatt as the strength/conditioning coaches.\nIn January 2017 ten players with MLB affiliations were announced as Team Israel roster members, and traveled to Israel to participate in various events. The players included Ike Davis, Sam Fuld, Ryan Lavarnway, Ty Kelly, Corey Baker, Jeremy Bleich, Jon Moscot (did not play due to arm injury), Danny Valencia, and Cody Decker. On January 12, Alex Katz officially confirmed his spot, as did Nick Rickels, on their respective Twitter accounts. It was later announced that additional players include Tyler Krieger, Dean Kremer, Jake Kalish, Blake Gailen, RC Orlan, Joey Wagman, Scott Burcham, and Gabe Cramer. Not one of its players was currently on the 40-man roster of a major-league team, though 10 of Team Israel's players had Major League experience and most of the others had minor league experience. For some of the ballplayers, including Ike Davis, Nate Freiman, Nick Rickles, and Josh Zeid, the 2017 WBC was their third appearance with Team Israel. Although Scott Feldman was originally announced as part of the roster, he later withdrew.\nTeam Israel was composed of players who overall have had a high level of education. Of the 36 players on the team's active roster or in its designated pitcher pool, 32 had attended university. Among those 32, two players attended Yale University, three went to Stanford University, two attended Duke University, two went to St. John's University, and seven attended a California State school. In addition, manager Jerry Weinstein had a UCLA master's degree in physical education. In contrast, as of 2012 a total of 4.3% of major league ballplayers had college degrees, and as of the prior year a total of 38% had played in college.\nCloser Brad Goldberg left spring training with the Chicago White Sox, and reliever Jared Lakind left the Pittsburgh Pirates, to join Team Israel in the second round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, in March 2017 in Japan.\n\"Source: \"\nMascot: Mensch on the Bench.\nCody Decker brought the team's mascot with him to Asia from the United States for the WBC. The mascot is \"Mensch on the Bench\", a five-foot-tall plush stuffed toy that looks a bit like a rabbi or Hasidic Jew with a long beard and mustache who is wearing a tallis and holding a candle. \"Mensch\", in Yiddish, means a person of integrity or honor.\nDecker said he \"tried getting him a first-class ticket. But that didn’t fly, so he was put in a duffel bag and checked.\" The mascot proved to be a big hit, and the team takes him everywhere. He has his own locker, sits on Team Israel's bench in the dugout during every game, and sat alongside Decker at a press conference in South Korea. Decker said: \"He’s a mascot, he’s a friend, he’s a teammate, he’s a borderline deity to our team... He brings a lot to the table... Every team needs their Jobu. He was ours. He had his own locker, and we even gave him offerings: Manischewitz, gelt, and gefilte fish... He is everywhere and nowhere all at once. His actual location is irrelevant because he exists in higher metaphysical planes. But he’s always near.\" Manager Jerry Weinstein said: \"He’s on the team. Everybody brings something to the team, and certainly The Mensch is a unifying factor for the ball club.\" Pitcher Gabe Cramer said: \"The Mensch on the Bench is ... a symbol we can rally around as a team. We are proud to be Jewish, but we know how to make and take a joke, something Jews have a long history of doing. The Mensch is a great way to have fun in the dugout while reminding us of why we’re here and who we’re representing.\"\n2017 main World Baseball Classic results.\nPrior to the start of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, ESPN considered Team Israel, ranked 41st in the world, to be the biggest underdog in the tournament, referring to it as the \"Jamaican bobsled team of the WBC\". Israel was the last of the 16 teams to qualify, was the only participant not in the top 20 in the world rankings, and not one of its players was currently on the 40-man roster of a major-league team (though most of Team Israel's players had Major League or minor league experience). In addition, ESPN ranked them 14 out of 16 in their power rankings. Israel's odds to win the WBC were 200-1, before the tournament began.\nFollowing the World Baseball Classic, Josh Zeid was named to the All-WBC team.\nRound 1 – Pool A.\nIn their first game Israel defeated the Pool A favorite and 2009 silver medalist South Korea, ranked # 3 in the world, in 10 innings by a score of 2-1. Israel's winning pitcher Josh Zeid said the win was the pinnacle of his career: \"This has to be it. This has to be the top, top win as a team, I think in my career. I’ve been lucky enough to be part of a couple of championships in the lower levels in the minor leagues and in high school, but nothing compares to this stage. Israel's third baseman Ty Kelly tweeted: \"Definitely the most stressful game I’ve ever been a part of. But it was worth it.\" Israel's catcher Ryan Lavarnway noted after the win: \"two generations ago, the way that this team was put together would have meant that we were being killed... It means a lot more than that we're here.\"\nOne day later, against Chinese Taipei, ranked # 4 in the world, Israel won again, this time by the score of 15-7. Israel's 15 runs were the most Taiwan had ever given up in a game in World Baseball Classic play. Taiwan manager Kuo Tai-yuan said of Israel: \"That's a very scary team.\"\nThe following day, Chinese Taipei lost to the Netherlands, thus guaranteeing Team Israel a spot in the second round as it had one of the top two records in the pool. The second round will be Pool E in Tokyo, Japan, later in March 2017. It also automatically qualified for the 2021 World Baseball Classic.\nLater that week, Israel went on to beat the Netherlands, ranked # 9 in the world and including a number of prominent Major Leaguers including Didi Gregorius, Xander Bogaerts, and Jonathan Schoop, 4-2 as Josh Zeid garnered his second save. Israel worked in nine pitchers during the game. In what NBC reported was thought to be the tallest batter-pitcher matchup in baseball history, the Dutch team’s pitcher Loek van Mil walked Israel's first baseman Nate Freiman.\nTeam Israel swept Pool A, 3-0, finishing atop the four-team pool, and outscoring its opponents 21-10. Israel became the first baseball team to go undefeated in the first round of the WBC’s main draw after entering the main draw by winning in a qualifying round. Following the game Team Israel's catcher, Ryan Lavarnway, was named Pool A MVP, after going 5-for-9 (.556/.692/.889), with four walks, a home run, and three RBIs.\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted congratulations to the team for its \"amazing journey,\" and the Israel Defence Forces tweeted its support. At the same time, many were unaware Israel was competing, including Minister of Sports Miri Regev.\nRound 2 – Pool E.\nRight-handed relief pitcher Brad Goldberg joined Team Israel in the second round of the World Baseball Classic in Japan. He had pitched in four games for the Chicago White Sox in spring training, and thrown 4.2 scoreless innings of relief. In addition, left-handed pitcher Jared Lakind joined the team.\nWriting for mlb.com, reporter Anthony Castrovince opined: \"When Team Israel and magnetic mascot \"Mensch on a Bench\" surprisingly get a shot at the semifinals, we all get a little \"verklempt\".\"\nIn the first game of the second round, Israel beat Cuba (5th-ranked in the world) by a score of 4-1. After falling behind 1-0 in the 2nd inning, Israel came from behind with one run in the 4th, two runs in the 6th, and one more in the 8th. Starter Jason Marquis (in 5.2 innings on three days' rest) and three Team Israel relief pitchers (including Brad Goldberg and Josh Zeid, who both threw 96 mph fastballs) kept Team Cuba to five hits and one run, a homer by Cuban star Alfredo Despaigne who became the all-time World Baseball Classic home run leader. Catcher Ryan Lavarnway had two hits for Israel.\n\"It feels like the World Series,\" said Team Israel Manager Jerry Weinstein, \"but only bigger.\"\nIn a rematch of their Pool A game in which Israel prevailed, the Netherlands defeated Israel 12-2 on March 13, giving Israel their first loss of the tournament. Undefeated two-time WBC champion Team Japan then beat Team Israel, 8-3.\nIsrael finished in third place in Pool E with a 1-2 record, and 4-2 overall in the tournament. Israel will not have to qualify for the 2021 World Baseball Classic, based on its 2017 performance. \"USA Today\" opined that the team's performance might inspire other American Jewish major leaguers to play for Team Israel at the 2021 WBC. Following the conclusion of the World Baseball Classic, Zeid was named to the 2017 All-World Baseball Classic team. First baseman Nate Freiman wrote an article describing his experiences on Team Israel, entitled \"The Mensches of March.\"\n\"Heading Home: The Tale of Team Israel\".\nIn June 2018 a documentary was released entitled \"Heading Home: The Tale of Team Israel\" which dealt with Israel at the 2017 World Baseball Classic.\n2023 World Baseball Classic.\nTeam Israel competed in the 2023 World Baseball Classic in March 12-15, 2023. It will play in Miami, Florida. Israel will face Team Puerto Rico, Team Dominican Republic, Team Venezuela, and Team Nicaragua. \nAmerican-Israeli Ian Kinsler, a former Major League All Star and two-time Gold Glove winner, and Israeli Olympian, will manage the team. Among the players who have committed to play for the team are All Star outfielder Joc Pederson, Gold Glove outfielder Harrison Bader, outfielder Kevin Pillar, catcher Garrett Stubbs, and American-Israelis catcher Ryan Lavarnway and infielder Ty Kelly. Pitchers who will be on the team include Israeli-American Dean Kremer, Eli Morgan, Richard Bleier, Robert Stock, Jake Bird, and American-Israelis Jake Fishman, Zack Weiss, and Bubby Rossman, while Scott Effross was slated to be on the team but injured his arm.\nOthers who may possibly join Team Israel include All Star pitcher Max Fried, pitcher Noah Davis, pitcher Kenny Rosenberg, and outfielder Mike Moustakas.

        "title": "Kent County Cricket Club in 1910",
        "text": "Kent County Cricket Club's 1910 season was the 21st season in which the County competed in the County Championship. Kent played 29 first-class cricket matches during the season, losing only five matches overall, and won their third Championship title. They finished well ahead of second place Surrey in the 1910 County Championship.\nAll-rounder Frank Woolley, who was becoming an established international player, was selected as one of Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1911 after a successful 1910 season.\nThe Championship title was the third of four by Kent in the years before the First World War. It followed their success in 1909. The club's fourth title was won in 1913.\nBackground.\nAfter decades of underachievement, Kent won their first County Championship in 1906. A mid-table finished in 1907 was followed by second place in 1908, despite winning more matches than the Champions Yorkshire. A second Championship title followed in 1909 with the Kent side securing the title well before the end of the season after losing only two matches.\nThe re-emergence of strong Kent sides was based on the development of a mix of \"gifted\" amateurs playing alongside an increasingly strong core of professionals, most of whom were a product of the club's Tonbridge Nursery - its player development centre based at the Angel Ground at Tonbridge. By 1906 professionals were making around 60% of all appearances for Kent, a figure which rose to 68% in 1910 and provided a solid foundation for the side to achieve success on the field.\n1910 season.\nKent's opening match of the season, against the MCC at Lord's, was cancelled following the death of King Edward VII and the county began the 1910 season with a loss to Oxford University before the County Championship got under way with an innings victory against Middlesex at Lord's. The second match of the Championship season, against Lancashire, was declared as \"Not counted\" as there was no play on the second day, 20 May, due to the funeral of the King.\nFour away Championship matches saw Kent win three times before losing to Leicestershire, a set of games which also featured a win against Cambridge University at Fenner's. Kent's first home game of the season was against Sussex at Tonbridge in June and saw the county begin a series of 10 unbeaten matches which lasted until the end of July. Eight of these matches were wins. A loss to Essex at Leyton was followed by seven successive winning matches, including two innings victories during Canterbury Cricket Week at the beginning of August.\nBy 12 August Kent had guaranteed the Championship title, the earliest date that the County Championship has ever been won. A loss against Championship runners-up Surrey at The Oval, a draw against Hampshire and a loss in the Champion County match in September completed the season.\nPlayers.\nThe 1910 side was captained by Ted Dillon in his second year of captaincy and featured England international players Colin Blythe, Douglas Carr, Arthur Fielder, Kenneth Hutchings and Frank Woolley. Blythe and Woolley had toured South Africa with England over the 1909–10 English winter, but only Woolley, who had played in all five Test matches during the tour, would go on to play again for England, having debuted the summer before.\nCarr, along with Arthur Day had been chosen as two of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in the 1910 edition of the almanack and Woolley was chosen in the 1911 edition. Fielder and Hutchings had been chosen in 1907 and Blythe in 1904. The nucleus of the team remained the same as the Championship winning sides of 1906 and 1909, with the core of the side increasingly becoming professionals who had developed in the county's Tonbridge Nursery. When Dillon, a shipbroker whose profession sometimes kept him away from cricket, was unable to play, former club captain Jack Mason generally led the side.\nFred Huish was the main wicket-keeper for Kent, with Jack Hubble replacing him in one non-Championship match. Huish, the senior professional in the Kent side at the time, was in the process of making 151 consecutive Championship appearances for Kent. Hubble, who succeeded Huish as wicket-keeper after World War I, played primarily as a batsman.\nFormer captain Cloudesley Marsham made his last first-class appearance for Kent before the First World War against Cambridge University and did not play in a Championship match during the season. Keith Barlow played against both Cambridge and Oxford University, the only first-class appearances of his career. Other than Barlow, four players made their senior debuts for Kent during 1910: Eric Hatfeild, Charles Hooman, Freddie Knott and Percy Morfee. Hooman appeared 15 times for the county during the season, his only season of first-class cricket with Kent.\nAges given as of the first day of Kent's 1910 County Championship season, 16 May 1910.\nSource: CricketArchive and CricInfo statistics\nStatistics.\nDuring 1910 Kent played 29 first-class matches, including 26 in the County Championship. They won 20, drew four and lost five matches, with 19 of the wins and only three losses occurring in the Championship. One match, against the MCC, was cancelled following the death of Edward VII.\nPunter Humphreys led the county in run scoring with a total of 1,618 runs, including 1,483 in the County Championship. James Seymour, Kenneth Hutchings and Frank Woolley each scored over 1,000 runs for Kent, with Ted Dillon adding 919. Hutchings scored four centuries for Kent, with Humphreys, Seymour and Woolley each scoring three. Humphreys' score of 200 not out against Lancashire at Tunbridge Wells was the highest score for Kent during the season and was his second double century for the county. At the time it was the third highest score in Kent history, beaten only by the 208 he had scored in 1909 and James Seymour's 204 from the 1907 season. Seymour made a top score of 193 against Middlesex at Canterbury in 1910, Kent's second highest score of the year.\nSeymour and Hutchings shared a partnership of 205 at Derby which was the highest third-wicket partnership of the Championship season and Humphreys and Arthur Day's stand of 254 was the highest fifth-wicket partnership of the season, set against Lancashire at Tunbridge Wells. As of 2016 this remains the highest fifth-wicket partnership at the Nevill Ground. Kent's total of 607/6 declared against Gloucestershire at Cheltenham was the highest team total of the Championship season and, as of 2016, remains Kent's highest score against Gloucestershire on any ground.\nColin Blythe was Kent's leading wicket taker in 1910, taking 149 Championship wickets at an average of 13.77. He took 165 wickets in total during the season for Kent, including taking 10 wickets in a match four times and five wickets in an innings 17 times during the season with his left arm spin bowling. Frank Woolley was the second leading wicket-taker with 132 wickets, whilst Arthur Fielder, with 77, Douglas Carr, with 63, and Bill Fairservice, with 37, also made significant bowling contributions.\nBlythe took two hat tricks during the season, against Surrey at Blackheath and against Derbyshire at Gravesend. These were the only two hat-tricks Blythe took for Kent in his prodigious career for the county. Frank Woolley returned the best innings bowling figures for Kent during the season, taking 8/52 against Sussex at Hastings. Arthur Fielder had the best match figures of 12/76 at Northampton.\nFred Huish claimed 73 wicket-keeping dismissals for Kent during the season, including 41 catches and 32 stumpings. Frank Woolley took 31 catches and James Seymour 30 catches during the season as part of Kent's well respected slip cordon. Humphreys, Seymour and Woolley played in every match for Kent during 1910, with Huish also playing in every Championship fixture.\nBatting statistics.\nThe table below includes all first-class batting for Kent during the 1910 season.\nSource: CricketArchive statistics and scorecards.\nBowling statistics.\nThe table below includes all first-class bowling for Kent during the 1910 season.\nSource: CricketArchive statistics and scorecards."

        "text": "The 2000 New Zealand rugby league tour of Great Britain was a tour by the New Zealand national rugby league team to compete at the 2000 Rugby League World Cup. New Zealand dominated Group 1 of the tournament thrashing Lebanon, the Cook Islands and Wales with a combined score of 206–28, before winning their quarter-final against France and their semi-final against England to qualify for the final. In the final, they lost to defending champions Australia 12-40 to finish runners-up in a World Cup tournament for the second time.\nBackground.\nAlongside Australia and France, New Zealand had competed at all eleven previous World Cups. New Zealand finished runner up in 1988.\nThe twelfth World Cup was scheduled to be held in Great Britain, Ireland and France in 2000, following on from the successful 1995 Rugby League World Cup. New Zealand was granted automatic entry into the 2000 World Cup.\nBuild up.\nIn the twelves months prior to the World Cup, New Zealand had finished second at the 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations, losing to Australia 20–22 in the final, before losing the 2000 Anzac test match by a record margin of 0-52.\nFor the first, and to date only, time, the New Zealand Māori rugby league team were invited to compete in the World Cup as Aotearoa Māori. Their squad included several past New Zealand representatives who were not selected for the final squad.\nFixtures.\nGroup B.\nLebanon.\nNew Zealand:1. Richie Barnett (c), 2. Leslie Vainikolo, 3. Tonie Carroll, 4. Willie Talau, 5. Brian Jellick, 6. Henry Paul, 7. Stacey Jones8. Smith, 9. Swain, 10. Pongia, 11. Logan Swann, 12. Kearney, 13. Ruben Wiki.Substitutes: Joe Vagana, Robbie Paul, Rua, Cayless.Coach:Frank Endacott\nSemi-final.\nThis was the England rugby league team's biggest ever loss. By winning this match, New Zealand had again equaled their record for consecutive victories with five.\nFinal.\nAustralia led at half time 6–0, after a dominant first half.\nAt the start of the second half, Nathan Hindmarsh scored to take the lead to 12-0 before Lesley Vainikolo pounced on a loose ball to dive over on 49 minutes. When Henry Paul landed the conversion, the deficit was back down to six points. Soon after, Australian halfback, Brett Kimmorley, made a break down the right before feeding the ball inside to fullback Darren Lockyer, who crossed for another try. Rogers' third successful kick made it 18–6 to the defending champions. However, the Kiwis quickly struck back when Tonie Carroll beat several Australian defenders to score. Henry Paul's conversion made it 18–12.\nNew Zealand then made several crucial errors and Australia were able to capitalise. Sailor grabbed two tries in the space of five minutes to take his tally for the tournament to 10 tries. The first of them came on 63 minutes courtesy of a reverse pass from Gidley. Rogers missed the second of the two quick conversions. Skipper Fittler then breached the New Zealand defence on 73 minutes to score his first try of the final which was converted by Rogers. Substitute Trent Barrett then finished the scoring, with a try that was converted by Rogers.\nAftermath.\nThe tournament was coach Frank Endacott's last in charge of New Zealand, and he was replaced by Gary Freeman for the 2001 season.\nTonie Carroll later switched his eligibility to Australia and played seven tests for the Kangaroos.\nNew Zealand next toured Great Britain in 2002. The next World Cup was held in Australia in 2008, and was won by New Zealand."

The tournament was hosted by Slovenia in the city of Ljubljana from 10 September to 17 September 2017. 12 teams from the 5 confederations competed in the tournament.\nTurkey defeated the home team in straight sets in the final to claim their first title in the competition. Bulgaria won the bronze medal outclassing Dominican Republic 4–2. Hande Baladın from Turkey was elected the MVP.\nAfter this tournament, FIVB declared that \"As per decision of May 2019 FIVB Board of Administration, the U23 WCH has been abolished.\"\nQualification.\nThe FIVB Sports Events Council revealed a proposal to streamline the number of teams participating in the Age Group World Championships.\nPools composition.\nTeams were seeded following the Serpentine system according to their FIVB World Rankings as of January 2017. FIVB reserved the right to seed the hosts as head of pool A regardless of the U23 World Ranking. Rankings are shown in brackets except the hosts who ranked 10th.\nTesting of new rules.\nThe 2017 FIVB Women's U23 World Championship will be a testing ground for a new scoring scheme currently under review by the FIVB, which, if successful, could mark a historical turning point for volleyball – much as the introduction of the Rally Scoring System did in the late 1990s.\nMatches in Ljubljana will be played to best-of-seven sets with each set to 15 points (with at least a two-point difference needed). Three ranking points will be awarded to teams winning 4–0, 4–1 or 4–2. Two points go the winner of a 4–3 match with one point for the loser. It is hoped that the new scoring system will reduce overall duration of matches, while making each set more attractive and exciting – much as tie-breaks are under the current regulations. The interval between sets is reduced to two minutes (from three). Teams will switch ends after the second set - and also, if needed, after sets 4, 5 and 6. In addition, there will be no technical timeouts – just two regular thirty-second timeouts per team per set.\nThe basic principles for the new scheme were tested for the first time in the Dutch League in the 2016–17 season. Further testing of the scheme were conducted at the Women's U23 World Championship in Cairo. During and after the competition, players, coaches, referees and officials will be evaluating the new system through a questionnaire, while duration and scoring statistics will be gathered and analysed.\nThis is the second time that a U23 World Championship serves as a testbed for new regulations. Matches of the inaugural Men's U23 World Championship in 2013 in Uberlândia were played to 21-point sets. In addition to the scoring system, a new serving regulation will be tried out in Cairo, with the server not allowed to land inside the court after a jump service.\nThe testing of the new rules has been received with criticism from the volleyball community.\nPool standing procedure.\nMatch won 4–0 , 4–1 or 4–2: 3 match points for the winner, 0 match points for the loser\nMatch won 4–3: 2 match points for the winner, 1 match point for the loser"

        "text": "The 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs was the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL) for the 2016–17 regular season. They began on April 12, 2017, after the regular season, and they concluded on June 11, 2017, with the Pittsburgh Penguins defeating the Nashville Predators four games to two in the Finals to win the Stanley Cup for the second consecutive year.\nThe Washington Capitals qualified for the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners for the second consecutive year with the most points (i.e. best record) during the regular season. The Detroit Red Wings failed to make the playoffs for the first time since the 1989–90 season, ending the NHL's and the Major North American Sports longest active playoff streak at 25 consecutive seasons; the streak was also tied for the third-longest streak in NHL history. The San Antonio Spurs of the NBA now owned the longest playoffs streak at 20 years in Major North American Sports. The longest active playoff streak was assumed by the Penguins with eleven consecutive appearances. The Edmonton Oilers made the playoffs for the first time since 2006, ending a then-record-tying playoff drought for a team with ten years missed (the Florida Panthers also missed the playoffs between 2001 and 2011 inclusively. Buffalo set the record in 2022 missing eleven consecutive postseasons). For the first time since 2006, both Alberta teams, the Oilers and the Calgary Flames, qualified for the postseason in the same year. For the first time since 2013, and the fourth time since 2002, all three Eastern Canadian teams (Montreal Canadiens, Ottawa Senators, and Toronto Maple Leafs) qualified for the playoffs. In all, five Canadian-based teams made the playoffs, matching 2004 and 2015, after a season in which none of the seven teams in Canada contended. Five Original Six teams made the playoffs, with only the previously mentioned Red Wings failing to make it.\nThe first round saw eighteen overtime games, eclipsing the previous record of seventeen overtime games in the first round set in 2013. There were 27 total overtime games in these playoffs, one short of the record set in 1993. It was also the first time since 2001 that no first round series went the full seven games.\nFor the eighth season in a row (and the twelfth time in the last fourteen seasons), a California-based team was advanced to the Western Conference final.\nPlayoff seeds.\nThis was the fourth year in which the top three teams in each division make the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference (for a total of eight playoff teams from each conference).\nThe following teams qualified for the playoffs:\nPlayoff bracket.\nIn each round, teams competed in a best-of-seven series following a 2–2–1–1–1 format (scores in the bracket indicate the number of games won in each best-of-seven series). The team with home ice advantage played at home for games one and two (and games five and seven, if necessary), and the other team was at home for games three and four (and game six, if necessary). The top three teams in each division made the playoffs, along with two wild cards in each conference, for a total of eight teams from each conference.\nIn the first round, the lower seeded wild card in the conference played against the division winner with the best record while the other wild card played against the other division winner, and both wild cards were de facto #4 seeds. The other series matched the second and third place teams from the divisions. In the first two rounds, home ice advantage was awarded to the team with the better seed; in the last two rounds, it was awarded to the team that had the better regular season record.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nFirst round.\nEastern Conference first round.\n(A1) Montreal Canadiens vs. (WC1) New York Rangers.\nThe Montreal Canadiens finished first in the Atlantic Division earning 103 points. The New York Rangers finished as the Eastern Conference's first wild-card, earning 102 points. This was the sixteenth playoff meeting between these two teams with New York winning eight of the fifteen previous series. They last met in the 2014 Eastern Conference final, which New York won in six games. Montreal won all three games in this year's regular-season series.\nThe Rangers eliminated the Canadiens in six games. In the first game of the series, Tanner Glass and Michael Grabner scored the only goals of the games as the Rangers won the game 2–0 on Henrik Lundqvist's 31-save shutout. In game two, the Canadiens tied the game with 18 seconds left, then in overtime, Alexander Radulov pushed it past the Rangers' goaltender to give Montreal a 4–3 victory. Radulov continued his scoring into game three, getting a goal and an assist to help the Canadiens achieve a 3–1 victory. The Rangers ended a six-game home-losing streak after game four, winning 2–1 over the Canadiens to tie the series 2–2. Mika Zibanejad got the overtime-winner for the Rangers in game five after Chris Kreider deflected a pass off of Canadiens defenceman Alexei Emelin, landing towards the forward who put it past goaltender Carey Price in a 3–2 win. Mats Zuccarello scored twice in game six as the Rangers eliminated the Canadiens in a 3–1 victory to advance to the second round.\n(A2) Ottawa Senators vs. (A3) Boston Bruins.\nThe Ottawa Senators finished second in the Atlantic Division, earning 98 points. The Boston Bruins earned 95 points in the regular season to finish third in the Atlantic. This was the first playoff meeting between the \"contemporary\" Ottawa franchise and Boston, and the first Boston-Ottawa series since the 1927 Stanley Cup Finals. Ottawa won all four games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Senators eliminated the Bruins in six games. In the first game, the Senators gained a 1–0 lead into the third on Bobby Ryan's goal in the second period, however, the Bruins scored twice in the final period with Brad Marchand having the final tally 2:33 before the game ended 2–1 for Boston. In game two, Ottawa came back from a two-goal deficit in the third period and won via Dion Phaneuf whose goal in overtime helped tie the series 1–1 after a 4–3 conquest. In game three, Ottawa had a three-goal lead with Mike Hoffman scoring twice, but the Bruins came back with three goals in the third period. In overtime, Bruins forward Riley Nash took a roughing penalty and on the ensuing power play, Bobby Ryan tipped in a pass from Kyle Turris ending the game 4–3 for the Senators. Bobby Ryan scored the only goal in game four, at the 5:49 mark of the third period, allowing the Senators to achieve a 3–1 series lead. Boston came back from an early 2–0 deficit in game five and the game would go to overtime. In double-overtime, Bruins rookie Sean Kuraly scored his second goal of the game, completing the comeback in a 3–2 feat. In game six, Clarke MacArthur scored the series-winning goal on the power play in overtime for Ottawa to advance to the second round.\n(M1) Washington Capitals vs. (WC2) Toronto Maple Leafs.\nThe Washington Capitals earned the Presidents' Trophy for the second consecutive year as the NHL's best regular season team this time with 118 points. The Toronto Maple Leafs finished as the Eastern Conference's second wild-card, earning 95 points. This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Washington won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nThis became only the third playoff series in NHL history in which five games were decided in overtime (the first being the 1951 Stanley Cup Finals between the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Montreal Canadiens and the second occurring in the 2012 Western Conference quarterfinals between the Phoenix Coyotes and the Chicago Blackhawks).\nThe Capitals defeated the Maple Leafs in six games. Although Toronto had a two-goal lead in the first ten minutes of the first game, Washington scored two goals, both from Justin Williams, and won the game 3–2 in overtime from Tom Wilson's goal. In game two, rookie Kasperi Kapanen scored twice including the game-winner in double-overtime leading the Maple Leafs to a 4–3 victory. Washington took two two-goal leads in game three; the first pick in the 2016 NHL Draft, Auston Matthews, helped soften the lead with his first playoff goal, but after the Capitals got a 3–1 lead, the Maple Leafs scored twice to tie the game. Then in overtime, Tyler Bozak tipped a shot past the Capitals' goaltender to give the Leafs a 2–1 series lead. Game four was the only game of the series not to go into overtime; Tom Wilson and T. J. Oshie both scored two goals and Oshie's second goal proved to be the game-winner in a 5–4 victory after an attempted comeback by Toronto was thwarted. Game five featured the fourth overtime game of this series with Justin Williams scoring for Capitals in a 2–1, taking a 3–2 series lead in the process. In game six, the game went to overtime for the fifth time this series and at 6:31 of the first overtime period Marcus Johansson scored his second goal for the Capitals in a 2–1 victory and another trip to the second round.\n(M2) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (M3) Columbus Blue Jackets.\nThe Pittsburgh Penguins finished second in the Metropolitan Division earning 111 points. The Columbus Blue Jackets earned 108 points to finish third in the Metropolitan. This was the second playoff meeting between these teams; they last met in the 2014 Eastern Conference first round, which Pittsburgh won in six games. The teams split this year's four-game regular season series.\nThe Penguins defeated the Blue Jackets in five games. Before game one began, Matt Murray, the starting goaltender for the Penguins, injured himself during warm-ups forcing Marc-Andre Fleury, who had been demoted to the backup for the season, to start the game; his team would win the game 3–1, making 31 saves in the process. Sidney Crosby got a goal and two assists in game two as the Penguins defeated the Blue Jackets 4–1 and took a 2–0 series lead. In game three, Jake Guentzel scored a hat-trick, his third being the overtime-winner as the Penguins came back from a two-goal deficit and defeated the Blue Jackets 5–4 and take a 3–0 series lead. Columbus avoided a sweep in game four, scoring with five different players in a 5–4 victory; this was also the franchise's first playoff win in regulation. In game five, Bryan Rust scored twice, including the series-winner, and Fleury made 49 saves in a 5–2 win for the Penguins to advance to the second round.\nWestern Conference first round.\n(C1) Chicago Blackhawks vs. (WC2) Nashville Predators.\nThe Chicago Blackhawks finished first in the Central Division earning 109 points. The Nashville Predators finished as the Western Conference's second wild-card, earning 94 points. This was the third playoff meeting between these teams with Chicago winning both previous series. They last met in the 2015 Western Conference first round, which Chicago won in six games. Chicago won four of the five games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Predators defeated the Blackhawks in a four-game sweep; this was the first time in NHL playoff history that an eighth-seeded team swept a playoff series against the top seed in their conference. Viktor Arvidsson scored the only goal in game one as the Predators shut out the Blackhawks, stopping all 29 shots they faced. The Blackhawks remained scoreless after game two, instead being outscored 5–0 with Pekka Rinne not only stopping all 30 shots he faced, but also providing two assists. Chicago finally scored a goal in game three and they maintained a two-goal lead throughout the second period, but in the third period, Filip Forsberg scored twice for Nashville to tie the game and send it to overtime. In overtime, Nashville forward Kevin Fiala skated around Chicago goalie Corey Crawford and put the puck past the Chicago netminder to complete the comeback in a 3–2 victory giving them their first 3–0 series lead. In game four, Roman Josi scored twice in a 4–1 victory and Rinne made 30 saves for the Predators, who swept a playoff opponent for the first time in franchise history.\n(C2) Minnesota Wild vs. (C3) St. Louis Blues.\nThe Minnesota Wild finished second in the Central Division earning 106 points. The St. Louis Blues earned 99 points to finish third in the Central. This was the second playoff meeting between these teams; their only previous meeting was the 2015 Western Conference first round, which Minnesota won in six games. St. Louis won three of the five games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Blues defeated the Wild in five games. St. Louis won the first game of the series 2–1 17:48 into overtime from Joel Edmundson's wrist shot after the Wild tied the game in the final minute of the game, Jake Allen made 51 saves in the process. In game two, Jaden Schwartz scored the game-winner with 2:27 left in the third period, giving the Blues another 2–1 victory over the Wild. The Wild continued to score only one goal in each game this series, losing the game nevertheless, this time 3–1 as Allen made 40 saves and the Blues took a 3–0 series lead. Devan Dubnyk kept the Wild alive in the series, stopping all 28 shots he faced in a 2–0 victory in game four. In game five, the Blues took a 3–1 lead in the third period only to see the Wild tie it up in the last ten minutes. However, in overtime, Magnus Paajarvi ended the game for St. Louis, defeating the Wild 4–3 to advance to the second round.\n(P1) Anaheim Ducks vs. (WC1) Calgary Flames.\nThe Anaheim Ducks finished first in the Pacific Division for the fifth consecutive year, this time earning 105 points. The Calgary Flames finished as the Western Conference's first wild-card, earning 94 points. This was the third playoff meeting between these teams with Anaheim winning both previous series. They last met in the 2015 Western Conference second round which Anaheim won in five games. Anaheim won four of the five games in this year's regular season series. Anaheim has also won 25 straight regular-season home games against Calgary.\nThe Ducks defeated the Flames in a four-game sweep. In game one, both Ryan Getzlaf and Jakob Silfverberg had a goal and an assist, the latter of whom had the game-winning goal in a 3–2 victory for the Ducks. Anaheim continued their home-dominance over Calgary defeating the Flames 3–2 with a goal and an assist by Getzlaf again. The Flames had a lead of 4–1 in game three, forcing Ducks goaltender John Gibson to be replaced by Jonathan Bernier. The Ducks came back in this game, scoring three times, in what would become the fourth overtime game of this night. Corey Perry then threw the puck towards the net and it bounced off both Calgary goaltender Brian Elliott and defenceman Michael Stone and into the net, to give the Ducks a 3–0 series lead. In game four, Gibson stopped 36 shots by the Flames, but allowed only one goal as the Ducks ended the series with a 3–1 win.\n(P2) Edmonton Oilers vs. (P3) San Jose Sharks.\nThe Edmonton Oilers finished second in the Pacific Division with 103 points. The San Jose Sharks earned 99 points in the regular season to finish third in the Pacific. Edmonton started a playoff series at home for the first time since the 1991 Campbell Conference final. This was the second playoff meeting between these teams; their only previous series was the 2006 Western Conference semifinals, which Edmonton won in six games. Edmonton won three of the five games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Oilers defeated the Sharks in six games. In Edmonton's first playoff game since 2006, the Oilers took a 2–0 lead in the first period, but the Sharks scored three goals over the second, third, and first overtime period winning the game 3–2 from Melker Karlsson's goal.

David Desharnais would end it at 18:15 of overtime to give the Oilers a 4–3 triumph and a 3–2 series lead. In game six, the Oilers scored twice in the second period, both on breakaways, and closed out the series with a 3–1 win.\nSecond round.\nEastern Conference second round.\n(A2) Ottawa Senators vs. (WC1) New York Rangers.\nThis was the second playoff meeting between these two teams; their only previous series was in the 2012 Eastern Conference quarterfinals, which New York won in seven games. This was the second time under the current playoff format and the second year in a row in which a wild-card team had more points than its opponent during the regular season but did not have home ice advantage; the other time was the Tampa Bay Lightning and the New York Islanders in the previous year's Eastern Conference second round. Ottawa won two of the three games in this year's regular season series.\nThe Senators defeated the Rangers in six games. In the first game, goaltender Craig Anderson made 34 saves in a 2–1 victory for the Senators.

The table is sorted by GAA, and the criteria for inclusion are bolded.\nTelevision.\nThis marked the sixth postseason under NBC Sports' current 10-year contract for American television rights to the NHL. All national coverage of games aired on either NBCSN, the NBC broadcast network, NHL Network, USA Network, or CNBC. During the first round, excluding games exclusively broadcast on NBC, the regional rightsholders of each participating U.S. team produced local telecasts of their respective games; NBCUniversal held exclusive rights to all games from the second round onward. Unlike past seasons, the national broadcasts were no longer blacked out on television in the markets of participating teams, and could co-exist with the local broadcasts (however, NBC-provided streaming was still restricted in Boston and Pittsburgh).\nFor first-round games involving Chicago, San Jose and Washington—teams whose regional rights are held by the co-owned NBC Sports Regional Networks—the national broadcasts shared the same video as the local broadcasts but overdubbed with national commentators. This was done so NBC would not have to bring additional equipment to these games to produce an entirely separate telecast for the national audience.\nIn Canada, for the third postseason under Rogers Media's current 12-year contract, coverage was broadcast by Sportsnet and CBC under the \"Hockey Night in Canada\" brand, and streamed on Sportsnet Now, CBCSports.ca (for games televised by CBC), or the subscription service Rogers NHL GameCentre Live. French-language coverage was on TVA Sports. Rogers agreed not to schedule games on CBC for the first four Sunday nights of the playoffs, so that the network could broadcast \"\", a documentary series it had commissioned as part of programming commemorating the 150th anniversary of Canadian confederation."

        "text": "This is a list of the competitive honours won by county cricket clubs in England and Wales. It lists every club to have won any of the five domestic trophies.\nThese honours consist of the County Championship, the Royal London One-Day Cup, the Friends Provident Trophy, the Benson &amp; Hedges Cup and the T20 Blast and their various former incarnations.\nThe County Championship's first season was 1890, and was the sole competition in county cricket for more than seventy years. The competition began with eight counties, which increased to fifteen by the end of the 19th century. Northamptonshire and Glamorgan joined in the first quarter of the twentieth century, since which time only Durham have added to the ranks.\nThe Gillette Cup was inaugurated in 1962 as the first limited overs competition. It began as a 65-over contest, and would undergo various name changes over its 36-year lifespan, with its time as the NatWest Trophy lasting the longest. The rules were often altered as well: number of overs was varied, minor counties were invited to compete, and in 2006 a group stage was introduced.\nThe Sunday League began in 1969 as 40-over competition. Like the Gillette Cup, its format and name changed on a regular basis. It was the first county tournament to feature the white ball, coloured kits, and team nicknames. In 2010 the league and the Friends Provident Trophy (the latest successor of the Gillette Cup) were merged to form one tournament, with both a league and knockout stage.\nThe Benson &amp; Hedges Cup was introduced in 1972 and lasted 30 years with the same sponsor. In its initial format, twenty teams were organised into four zonal groups in its original format with the games played at the start of the season in May. Various other teams made up the numbers, with 17 (and later 18) counties being joined by 2-3 extra sides. The first two teams in each group went on to contest a quarter-final knock-out stage. From 1993-1994 and in 1999, the tournament was a straight knockout tournament. The group stage returned between 1995 and 1998, and for the last three years of the tournament.\nThe Twenty20 Cup was created in 2003 and was based on three divisions of six teams, who played each other once (twice from 2008), with the top 8 teams qualifying for the quarter-finals. In 2010 the tournament was renamed the Friends Provident t20 (later the Friends Life t20) and the 3 groups of six teams were changed to two groups of 9, and then back again for 2012 and 2013. The current tournament, the t20 Blast, begun in 2014, has again returned to having groups of 9, with the top four teams from each group qualifying for the quarter-finals.\nSummary totals.\n† denotes defunct competition"

        "text": "Brian Mason (born September 5, 1950) is a Canadian retired ice hockey coach who led RIT to their first national championship in 1983.\nCareer.\nBrian Mason debuted in college hockey in 1970 with the powerhouse Clarkson Golden Knights led by legendary coach Len Ceglarski. Clarkson had finished up as the tournament runner-up the year before and despite a second-place finish in the 1971 tournament the Golden Knights were passed over in favor of regular season champion Boston University. While Mason would lead the team in scoring for the next two seasons Clarkson was unable to get close to another tournament berth during his time there. Mason went on to a brief professional career with the IHL's Dayton Gems before hanging up his skates in 1975–76 season.\nBy 1978 Mason was back in college, this time behind the bench at Rensselaer as an assistant. After only two years he was given the opportunity to be a head coach at Division II RIT. In his four years there Mason's squads never had a losing season and won more games every season, growing from 14 in his first year to 29 in his last. He also brought RIT their first national title in 1982-83 and their first ECAC West tournament title the year after. On April 6, 1984 Dartmouth announced that Mason would be replacing George Crowe as head coach.\nMason was taking over a declining program in Hanover that had seen some success in previous years but the recent returns hadn't been good. His first two seasons with the Big Green saw modest improvements to 5- and 7-win seasons but a 2-22-1 mark in his third year was the worst the program had ever recorded. A significant jump to 10 wins the next year began to erode immediately thereafter and ended with only four victories in 1989-90, leading to Mason's dismissal from the team. In his six-year tenure the Big Green never had a winning season and missed the ECAC tournament every time. The only saving grace for Mason is that the year after he left his replacement Ben Smith beat Mason's record for the worst season in Dartmouth history with a 1-24-3 finish."

        "title": "Basketball in Africa",
        "text": "Basketball is a rapidly growing sport on the continent of Africa. While its popularity is still dwarfed by association football, foreign investors, led by the National Basketball Association (NBA), are betting that it will be able to compete in the near future.\nThere are currently 16 African-born players in the National Basketball Association (NBA), including the league's Most Valuable Player, Joel Embiid.\nHistory.\nMen's basketball made its debut as a contested Olympic sport in Berlin, Germany in 1936. At this event, Egypt fielded a team, making it the first African nation to compete in Olympic basketball. In this tournament, Egypt finished outside of the medal places with a record of 1-3, with its sole win coming against Turkey by a score of 33-23.\nHakeem Olajuwon, widely considered to be the best African player of all time, arrived from Nigeria in 1980 as an unheralded recruit to the University of Houston. Here he emerged as a star, forming a formidable duo with Clyde Drexler, that came to be known as \"Phi Slamma Jamma,\" en route to back-to-back NCAA championship games. Olajuwon proceeded to be selected first overall in the 1984 NBA draft, ahead of Michael Jordan and would put together an illustrious career including back-to-back NBA championships in 1994 and 95, the MVP award in 1994, and a selection to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008. Hakeem's popularity catalyzed the growth of basketball in Africa, akin to Yao Ming's impact on the game in China.\nIn 2019, the Toronto Raptors, featuring African players Pascal Siakam (Cameroon) and Serge Ibaka (Republic of the Congo), and general manager Masai Ujiri (Nigeria), defeated the Golden State Warriors to win the NBA title. The Raptors, under the guidance of Ujiri, the first and only African general manager in the NBA to this point, have since further invested in African talent to fill their lineup around two-time All-NBA player, Siakam. In the 2022-23 season, the Raptors featured eight African players on their roster.\nIn 2023, Philadelphia 76ers center from Yaoundé, Cameroon, Joel Embiid, was named NBA MVP after two consecutive seasons finishing as runner-up.\nMajor influences.\nHakeem Olajuwon.\nHakeem Olajuwon, member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, two-time NBA Champion (1994 and 1995), 1994 MVP, and first overall pick in the 1984 NBA Draft, was born and raised in Lagos, Nigeria. His stardom catalyzed the NBA’s interest in the continent as a future talent hot spot and bolstered African interest in the sport. As current CEO of NBA Africa Victor Williams put it, “Hakeem’s example inspired so many other Africans to now start thinking of basketball as a career, as an opportunity, and inspired people in the NBA to think of Africa as a place where the game could grow.” Speaking further to the role Olajuwon played in highlighting the pathway basketball could present to African prospects, Dikembe Mutombo, fellow Hall of Famer and an eight-time NBA All-Star from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, shared, “Hakeem is my idol. He inspired all of us. I think if Hakeem hadn’t done it the way he did it, not many people would’ve followed. He opened that door. I talk about him being the king of Africa. He opened that door for us. He sat on that throne so we can follow.”\nOlajuwon, despite his Nigerian roots, opted to play for the United States in international competition at the senior level where he claimed a gold medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. He faced some criticism in Nigeria for this decision, to which he responded, “I’ve been [in the United States] over 10 years, my home is in Houston and a lot of family is in the United States. It was just natural. I’m still Nigerian and I’m proud of it, but I’m a U.S. citizen.”\nMasai Ujiri.\nMasai Ujiri, President of the Toronto Raptors, 2019 NBA Champion and 2013 NBA Executive of the Year, was raised in Zaria, Nigeria by Kenyan and Nigerian parents. After a brief stint playing professionally in Europe, Ujiri transitioned to scouting and eventually front office team management in the NBA. Ujiri is the first and only African general manager of a North American major league sports franchise. Outside of his role with the Raptors, Ujiri is actively involved in growing the sport of basketball in Africa through his Giants of Africa camps, which he co-founded with good friend Godwin Owinje in 2003. Giants of Africa began as a single camp in Nigeria and has since expanded to 15 countries across the continent, bolsters corporate sponsorships with the likes of Nike and 2K Foundations, and was subject of a 2016 film titled “Giants of Africa”.\nForeign Investment.\nNBA.\nThe NBA, the world’s premier professional basketball league, has led the way in investing in African basketball. The league has its own branch on the continent, named NBA Africa, under which its flagship investments are operated, these being the Basketball Africa League (BAL), the Basketball Without Borders elite camps, and the NBA Academy Africa in Saly, Senegal. The NBA Africa entity was officially established in May 2021, just over a decade after the NBA opened its African headquarters in Johannesburg, South Africa. It is currently led by CEO Victor Williams and was modeled on the highly successful NBA China entity, which is estimated to have a market value of $5 billion. Upon the launch of NBA Africa, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver set the value of the entity just shy of $1 billion, elaborating that “much of that valuation comes from the enormous optimism we see in this brand in Africa and our opportunity to bring content directly to the people of the many countries of Africa.”\nPartners with the NBA in its African ventures include former President of the United States Barack Obama, actor Forest Whitaker, author Dambisa Moyo, and former NBA players Luol Deng, Grant Hill, and Dikembe Mutombo.\nThe NBA's investment began in 2003 under former commissioner David Stern with the establishment of Basketball Without Borders, an elite camp for top local prospects. The league followed this up with the establishment of its headquarters in Johannesburg, South Africa in 2010, amidst the country's hosting of the World Cup. NBA Academy Africa, based in Saly, Senegal, opened in 2018 as an elite facility to streamline and professionalize development of the continent's most promising talents. Most recently, the NBA launched the BAL in collaboration with FIBA, which has become the premier club competition on the continent.\nWhile the NBA's investment in African basketball has generally received a positive reception, the league was criticized for its decision to host the inaugural 2021 season of the BAL in a \"bubble\" environment in Kigali, Rwanda due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This bubble format mirrored that of the NBA in 2020, which finished its season at the Walt Disney World complex in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. This decision sparked global media backlash due to concerns over Rwandan president Paul Kagame’s authoritarian leadership and questions surrounding his government's human rights record. Critics sought to portray the NBA in a hypocritical lens given the concurrent political stances the league took in 2020 in the United States in response to major police violence incidents: both the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis and shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin.\nCompetitions.\nBasketball Africa League (BAL).\nBasketball Africa League (BAL), founded by the National Basketball Association (NBA) and International Basketball Federation (FIBA), kicked off its inaugural season in 2021. It is a continent-wide league, featuring 12 teams from different countries who compete in a group stage to determine seeding for a single-elimination tournament from which a champion is crowned. The The BAL's model is in many ways analogous to association football's popular UEFA Champions League, which pits the best club teams across Europe against each other. In 2023, the BAL's games will be broadcast over to the NBA app to 214 countries and territories in seven languages.\nThe league has rules mandating a quota of at least eight players per team being citizens of the team's nation and restricting the number of non-African roster spots to two to ensure that African players are the face of the league. High profile foreign players such as rapper J. Cole and Zaire Wade, son of Dwayne Wade, have appeared in the league, helping to bring a spotlight to the BAL in the United States.\nViewership.\nThe 2022 iteration of the tournament was reported to have had over 50,000 atendees, highlighted by a sold-out crowd of 10,000 at BK Arena in Kigali, Rwanda for the matchup between U.S. Monastir and Petro De Luanda."

        "title": "Super Bowl LV",
        "text": "Super Bowl LV was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2020 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers defeated the defending American Football Conference (AFC) and Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs, 31–9. The game was played on February 7, 2021, at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the home stadium of the Buccaneers, marking the first time a team played a Super Bowl in its home stadium; coincidentally, Super Bowl LV was the first of two consecutive Super Bowls in which the venue was the home stadium of the eventual winners, as Super Bowl LVI was won by the Los Angeles Rams at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California. Due to COVID-19 protocols limiting the stadium's seating capacity to 25,000 fans, it was the least-attended Super Bowl.\nThe Buccaneers' victory was their second and made them one of two teams, along with the Baltimore Ravens, to be undefeated in multiple Super Bowls. They finished the regular season with an 11–5 record and a wild card berth to advance to their second Super Bowl appearance through the guidance of several new acquisitions, most notably 21-year veteran quarterback Tom Brady in his first season away from the New England Patriots. The Chiefs, aided by their top-ranked offense, finished the regular season with a league-best 14–2 record to advance to their fourth Super Bowl appearance and were the defending Super Bowl LIV champions, seeking to become the first repeat champions since the Patriots in 2004.\nFor the first time under quarterback Patrick Mahomes, the Chiefs failed to score a touchdown and lost by double-digits, making them the third Super Bowl team not to score a touchdown. They also committed 11 penalties for 120 yards, including a record eight penalties for 95 yards in the first half, most of which were called against the defense. The Buccaneers capitalized on these struggles to take a commanding 21–6 lead at halftime and dominated the remainder of the game. Brady, who also extended his player records for Super Bowl appearances to ten and wins to seven, was named Super Bowl MVP for a record fifth time and was the first to receive the award with multiple franchises. He became the oldest player to receive the honor and win a Super Bowl as the starting quarterback at age 43, breaking additional personal records, while Bruce Arians was the oldest head coach to win the Super Bowl at 68.\nThe game was televised nationally by CBS. Country music singer Eric Church and R&amp;B singer Jazmine Sullivan performed the national anthem, while the halftime show was headlined by Canadian singer the Weeknd. On television, Super Bowl LV was seen by 91.63 million viewers, the lowest ratings for the game since 2006. Combined with viewership on other platforms, viewership was down by 5% overall in comparison to Super Bowl LIV, but with a 69% increase in average streaming viewership.\nBackground.\nHost selection process.\nOn May 19, 2015, the league announced the four finalists for hosting Super Bowl LIII in 2019 and Super Bowl LIV in 2020. NFL team owners voted on these cities on May 24, 2016, with the first round of voting determining the host for Super Bowl LIII, and the second round deciding the site for Super Bowl LIV. In a development not known in advance, a third round of voting was added to select a Super Bowl LV hosting site. Atlanta and Miami were awarded Super Bowls LIII and LIV respectively, removing them from the running for LV. Los Angeles was not eligible for Super Bowl LIII, as their stadium was under construction and would not yet be finished; it was eligible for LIV and LV, and opted to bid only on the latter.\nThe two candidates were:\nLos Angeles was originally chosen as the host site for Super Bowl LV in a vote on May 24, 2016. However, due to construction delays, authorities announced that the stadium would not be completed until the start of the 2020 NFL season. On May 23, 2017, NFL owners voted unanimously, with the Rams' approval, to move Super Bowl LV to Tampa. The City of Inglewood instead hosted Super Bowl LVI in 2022.\nImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAs of the start of the 2020 NFL season, the league had forbidden on-field entertainment, such as halftime shows and national anthem performances at games with fans. These elements, which have historically been cornerstones of the Super Bowl entertainment, would have been produced off-site had restrictions remained in place. In case a COVID-19 outbreak forced the postponements of regular season and playoff games, the league stated that Super Bowl LV could have been delayed as far as February 28.\nThe state of Florida removed capacity restrictions for sporting events in October, although the three Florida-based teams have voluntarily maintained 20–25 percent capacity limits. As of late October 2020, the NFL was planning a minimum attendance of 20% of capacity, in hopes that a larger capacity would be possible by game day.\nOn January 22, 2021, the NFL had originally announced that the game would have 22,000 fans in attendance, 7,500 of whom would be health care workers who had received a COVID-19 vaccine, primarily from the Tampa and central Florida region. The NFL also filled in the empty seats by selling 30,000 cardboard cutouts to fans. On February 2, the league increased the expected attendance to 25,000. Super Bowl LV was the least-attended NFL championship game since 1949, where 22,245 attended because of weather.\nNFL protocols for the 2020 season required that the closest rows of seats be blocked with tarps to reduce spectator proximity to the field. For the Super Bowl, they were covered with additional LED video boards.\nThe traditional events held during Super Bowl week were significantly reduced. Capacity at the Super Bowl Experience at Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park was limited due to health and safety protocols. Instead of holding practices and participating in media events during the entire week in the Super Bowl host city, the Chiefs flew into Tampa on the day before the game as they had during the regular season (had another NFC team advanced to the Super Bowl instead of the Buccaneers, they would have done this as well). The \"Super Bowl Opening Night\" festivities on the Monday preceding the game were cancelled and replaced with a virtual media availability.\nIn March, health officials in Hillsborough County, Florida determined that Super Bowl LV was not a superspreader event. The officials cited 53 cases (out of 14,809 confirmed cases overall in a one-month span surrounding the game) that were traced to official Super Bowl events, three of those being people who attended the game itself; they also noted that unofficial house parties were likely far greater causes of spread during that time span.\nTeams.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nAs defending Super Bowl Champions, the Kansas City Chiefs recorded an NFL-best record in 2020 under eighth-year head coach Andy Reid. Other than a 40–32 loss against the Las Vegas Raiders in week 5, their only defeat was in the final game of the season against the Los Angeles Chargers, when they rested most of their starters because they had already clinched the No. 1 seed in the playoffs. This appearance was the Chiefs' fourth trip to the Super Bowl. They lost Super Bowl I (1967), but won Super Bowls IV (1970) and LIV (2020).\nKansas City's offense ranked first in the NFL in yards (6,653) and sixth in points scored (473). Quarterback Patrick Mahomes made the Pro Bowl for the third consecutive season, throwing for 4,740 yards (second in the league) and 38 touchdowns, with only six interceptions, while also finishing the season as Kansas City's second leading rusher with a career high 308 yards and two scores. His main target was Pro Bowl tight end Travis Kelce, who caught 105 passes for 1,416 yards and 11 touchdowns, making him the NFL's second leading receiver and setting a new league record for receiving yards by a tight end. Pro Bowl receiver Tyreek Hill had 87 receptions for 1,276 yards and 15 touchdowns, while also rushing for 132 yards and two touchdowns. Mahomes also had receivers Demarcus Robinson (45 receptions for 466 yards), Mecole Hardman (41 reception for 561 yards and 360 return yards on special teams), and Sammy Watkins (37 receptions for 421 yards). The team's leading rusher from 2019, Damien Williams, opted out of the 2020 season due to COVID-19 concerns and because his mother had recently been diagnosed with Stage IV cancer. In his place, rookie running back Clyde Edwards-Helaire stepped up to fill the void, rushing for 808 yards and four touchdowns, while also catching 36 passes for 297 yards and another touchdown Tackle Eric Fisher led the Chiefs offensive line, earning a Pro Bowl selection. However, he was forced to miss the Super Bowl after suffering a torn achilles tendon in the AFC championship game. Laurent Duvernay-Tardif, a starting guard for the 2019 season, was first NFL player to announce he would not play the season because of COVID-19, instead working as an orderly at a Montreal long-term care facility during the pandemic. On special teams, kicker Harrison Butker made 25-of-27 field goals, including all four of his attempts from over 50 yards.\nThe Chiefs defense was ranked 16th in the league in yards allowed (5,733). The Chiefs defensive line was led by Pro Bowl selections Chris Jones (7 sacks and two forced fumbles) and Frank Clark (6 sacks). Linebacker Anthony Hitchens ranked second on the team with 78 tackles. Kansas City's secondary was led by Pro Bowl strong safety Tyrann Mathieu (68 tackles, six interceptions, and one fumble recovery) and free safety Daniel Sorensen (91 tackles, three interceptions, and two forced fumbles).\nTampa Bay Buccaneers.\nThe Tampa Bay Buccaneers finished the 2020 season with an record under second-year head coach Bruce Arians. Prior to this, the team had not won a playoff game since Super Bowl XXXVII in 2003 and had not made the playoffs since 2007–08. The team also recorded only three winning seasons since 2008 and had gone 7–9 the previous year.\nDuring the 2020 off-season, the Buccaneers chose not to re-sign quarterback Jameis Winston, whom they selected first overall in 2015. To replace Winston, they made arguably the biggest off-season acquisition by signing 20-year veteran Tom Brady, one of the NFL's most decorated players. The signing marked the first time that Brady would play for a team other than the New England Patriots, where he was considered the offensive engine of the franchise's dynasty. Tight end Rob Gronkowski, Brady's teammate in New England and considered one of the greatest in his position, was lured out of retirement and acquired through a trade with the Patriots. Further off-season acquisitions included running back Leonard Fournette, running back LeSean McCoy, and placekicker Ryan Succop. In the 2020 NFL draft, Tampa Bay bolstered their offensive line by selecting tackle Tristan Wirfs 13th overall. After Week 6, they signed accomplished, but controversial wide receiver Antonio Brown, who had been out of the league for over a year.\nTampa Bay's offense was ranked seventh in league yards (6,145) and third in points scored (492). The 43-year old Brady threw for 4,633 yards and 40 touchdowns, 12 interceptions and rushed for three touchdowns. His main targets were Mike Evans who caught 70 passes for 1,006 yards and 13 touchdowns, Chris Godwin who caught 65 passes for 840 yards and seven touchdowns, and Rob Gronkowski who caught 45 passes for 623 yards and seven touchdowns. Brady also had other receivers to go to with Scotty Miller (33 passes, 501 yards and three touchdowns), Antonio Brown (44 catches, 483 yards and four touchdowns), and Cameron Brate (28 catches, 282 yards and two touchdowns). Ronald Jones was the team's leading rusher with 978 yards and seven touchdowns, while also catching 28 passes for 165 yards and another touchdown. Leonard Fournette also added 367 rushing yards and six touchdowns, while also hauling in 36 passes. Kicker Ryan Succop ranked sixth in the NFL with 136 points, making 28-of-31 field goal attempts.\nTampa Bay's defense was ranked sixth in the league in yardage allowed (5,234). The defensive line was anchored by defensive ends Ndamukong Suh (six sacks) and William Gholston (20 quarterback hits and eight tackles for loss). The line was also aided by edge rushing outside linebackers Jason Pierre-Paul, the team's lone Pro Bowl selection (9 sacks, four forced fumbles, two fumble recoveries), and Shaquil Barrett (eight sacks and two force fumbles). The team also had linebackers Devin White (140 tackles and nine sacks) and Lavonte David (117 tackles and three forced fumbles). Cornerback Carlton Davis led the team with four interceptions, while rookie safety Antoine Winfield Jr. added 94 tackles, one interception, and three sacks.\nPlayoffs.\nThe Chiefs won the AFC West division title for a fifth consecutive year and the top seed in the AFC playoffs with a league-best 14–2 record. After clinching a first-round bye, the Chiefs defeated the Cleveland Browns 22–17 in the Divisional round to send them to their third straight AFC Championship Game. They then won 38–24 over the Buffalo Bills for their second straight Lamar Hunt Trophy. However, the victories proved costly. In the divisional round, quarterback Patrick Mahomes suffered a turf toe injury before being removed in the third quarter due to a concussion. The former continued to afflict Mahomes entering the Super Bowl, with him required to undergo toe surgery after the game. Additionally, left tackle Eric Fisher departed the conference championship with a torn Achilles, forcing him to miss the Super Bowl. The loss of Fisher compounded the Chiefs' offensive line troubles, as right tackle Mitchell Schwartz had been lost earlier in the season with a back injury.\nMeanwhile, the Buccaneers finished as the fifth seed and second place in the NFC South with an 11–5 record. They were the first team under quarterback Tom Brady to reach the playoffs as a wild card. In the wild-card round, the Buccaneers defeated the Washington Football Team 31–23, to advance to the divisional round against the New Orleans Saints, who had swept them in the regular season. The Buccaneers then defeated the Saints 30–20 to advance to the NFC Championship Game. The Buccaneers then upset the top-seeded Green Bay Packers in the NFC Championship Game 31–26 advancing to the Super Bowl. The Buccaneers became the fifth team to win three away games en route to the Super Bowl. They also became the first team to make the Super Bowl as a Wild Card team since the 2010 Green Bay Packers. The Buccaneers became the first team to play and win a Super Bowl in its home stadium, and only the third to play in their home metro area (alongside the 1979 Los Angeles Rams and 1984 San Francisco 49ers).\nThis was the final Super Bowl in the 16-game schedule era, which began with the 1978 NFL season. The following season, the NFL went to a 17-game schedule.\nPre-game notes.\nThe Buccaneers were the designated home team for Super Bowl LV, as the home team alternates between the two conferences annually. The fact that the Buccaneers were designated as the \"home\" team in their home stadium was a coincidence. As the designated home team, the Buccaneers elected to wear their white jerseys with pewter pants. The Chiefs wore their red jerseys with white pants.\nEven though the game was played in the Buccaneers' home stadium, the league treated this as a neutral site game. The Buccaneers were only allowed to fire the cannons from the stadium's signature pirate ship for player introductions and after the end of the game, but not during every scoring play and when the offense enters the red zone as they usually would. In addition, the stadium decor including the replica pirate ship sails were accordingly changed from Buccaneers' logos to those promoting the Super Bowl.\nGambling establishments had the Chiefs as three-point favorites and projected 57 points scored.\nThe Chiefs and Buccaneers played each other during the regular season. The Chiefs won the Week 12 game in Tampa, 27–24. This marked the 14th time the Super Bowl featured a rematch of a regular season game and the first time this has happened since Super Bowl XLVI in 2012.\nThis was the first time that both Super Bowl starting quarterbacks – Patrick Mahomes and Tom Brady – have won the AP NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP awards; as Brady is Mahomes' senior by 18 years, some billed the matchup as comparable to Michael Jordan versus LeBron James.\nSince the Buccaneers reached the Super Bowl, Tampa was nicknamed \"Champa Bay\", as all three of the area's major professional sports teams had made their league's championship round during the past five months; A few months prior, the Tampa Bay Lightning had won the 2020 Stanley Cup Finals, while the Tampa Bay Rays had advanced to but lost the 2020 World Series.\nWith Buccaneers head coach Bruce Arians and Chiefs head coach Andy Reid both 68 years old, Super Bowl LV set the record for the oldest combined age between both coaches.\nChiefs linebackers coach Britt Reid, the son of head coach Andy Reid, was involved in a car accident on February 4, 2021. Two young children were injured in the crash. The younger Reid admitted to consuming two to three alcoholic drinks and being on Adderall, a prescription medication, while driving. He did not coach in the game.\nBroadcasting.\nUnited States.\nTelevision.\nSuper Bowl LV was televised by CBS. Although NBC was to air this game under the current rotation, they traded the game to CBS in exchange for Super Bowl LVI, which fell during the 2022 Winter Olympics and is the first to be scheduled during an ongoing Olympic Games (this also upheld a gentleman's agreement between the NFL's broadcasters not to counterprogram the Super Bowl, as NBC also holds the U.S. broadcast rights to the Olympics). CBS, to an extent, also benefited from holding rights to the Super Bowl in the same year that it held the rights to the NCAA Final Four, which is cycled with WarnerMedia Entertainment channels on a two-year cycle with TBS, as well as the AFC Championship Game in primetime, which contractually alternates between afternoon and primetime on a two-year cycle with the NFC Championship Game on Fox.\nCBS used 120 cameras in total, including ten 4K cameras, two 8K cameras, a crane camera, a Trolley Cam running parallel with the field, and two Sony Venice cameras that were used to produce cinematic and \"3D-like\" scenes reminiscent of video games. Production was decentralized due to COVID-19 protocols, with some production duties being conducted remotely from the CBS Broadcast Center in New York City and at individual employees' homes. CBS officially introduced a rebranding of the CBS Sports division during Super Bowl LV, as part of a larger reimaging and standardization of CBS and its main divisions.\nBuilding upon its involvement in a youth-oriented broadcast of one of the Wild Card games, Nickelodeon contributed family-oriented social media content, including \"Nick-ified\" highlight videos with similar augmented reality effects to the aforementioned Wild Card broadcast (and featured during a highlights package seen on the CBS broadcast at halftime). Nickelodeon also aired a half-hour preview special for the game, and an NFL-themed edition of \"Unfiltered\" aired as a segment during CBS's pre-game show \"The Super Bowl Today\".\nThis was third and final Super Bowl televised by CBS in which ESPN Deportes aired the Spanish-language broadcast. Unlike NBC and Fox, CBS does not have a Spanish-language network. The sublicense for CBS's next Super Bowl broadcast, Super Bowl LVIII was sold to Univision.\nLead-out programs.\nOn December 3, 2020, CBS announced that its lead-out program would be the series premiere of \"The Equalizer\". After late local programs, CBS also aired a special Sunday-night episode of \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\".\nAdvertising.\nThe estimated cost of a 30-second commercial at Super Bowl LV remained steady with 2020, with CBS reportedly charging around $5.5 million. The economic impact of COVID-19 prompted some brands to skip the game, including Avocados from Mexico, Budweiser (its first absence in 37 years), Coca-Cola, Hyundai, and Pepsi (focusing more on its halftime show sponsorship). Budweiser announced that it would donate the estimated cost of a Super Bowl ad to the Ad Council to fund public service announcements for COVID-19 vaccination. However, parent company Anheuser-Busch still aired commercials for other brands during the game (with a spend in line with that of Super Bowl LIV), including Bud Light, Bud Light Seltzer, and Michelob Ultra, as well as its first-ever corporate spot, directed by filmmaker David Fincher.\nCompanies such as DraftKings, Fiverr, Logitech, and Vroom made their Super Bowl debut as advertisers. Robinhood, which had recently gained mainstream media attention due to the GameStop short squeeze, aired its first Super Bowl commercial at the game. Reddit ran a five-second ad in nine of the top ten media markets, saying that was all it could afford.\nAmazon Studios and Universal Pictures aired commercials for upcoming films during the game, including \"Coming 2 America\" and \"Old\". Disney aired commercials for its upcoming films and Disney+ series. CBS promoted the upcoming relaunch of its subscription streaming service CBS All Access as Paramount+.\nStreaming.\nThe game was streamed on CBS All Access (whose then-upcoming relaunch as Paramount+ in March 2021 was promoted during the game), CBSSports.com, and the CBS Sports mobile app.\nIt was also available with exclusive camera angles through the NFL mobile app and Yahoo! Sports mobile app. Viewers with an iPhone 12 who were in the stadium could see seven exclusive angles, and viewers at home could see five.\nRatings.\nAround 91.6 million viewers watched Super Bowl LV on linear television, an 8% decline over Super Bowl LIV and the least-watched game since 2006. CBS reported a total of 96.4 million viewers when combined with viewership of the Spanish-language broadcast and digital platforms, a 5% year-over-year decline overall. CBS reported an average of 5.7 million streaming viewers per-minute, a 69% increase year-over-year that made it the most-streamed Super Bowl to-date.\nInternational.\nIn Canada, CTV and TSN televised this game in English and RDS in French. As with the 2020 edition, CTV invoked simultaneous substitution over U.S. network signals (including ads) distributed in Canada, as a CRTC ban on such substitutions during the Super Bowl had been overturned by a December 2019 Supreme Court of Canada decision.\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, the game was televised on the free-to-air channel BBC One and paid-subscription channel Sky One (as well as its sister channels Sky Sports Main Event and NFL). It was carried on radio via BBC Radio 5 Live. In Germany, Austria and Switzerland, free-to-air channel ProSieben broadcast the event through its \"ran\" format; 2.2 million Germans watched the game, which encouraged the NFL to further consider adding Germany to the International Series in the future. In Belgium and Portugal the game was televised by paid-subscription channel Eleven Sports. In Poland the game was broadcast on the free-to-air channel TVP Sport, marking the first time an NFL game was available on a Polish open channel.\nSubscription streaming platform DAZN also streamed the Super Bowl in several countries including Canada, Germany, and Japan. In Australia, the game was broadcast by Melbourne radio station 1116 SEN and commentated by Gerard Whateley\nEntertainment.\nPre-game ceremonies.\nA special pre-game concert for the invited health care workers attending the game—the \"TikTok Tailgate\"—was held in the afternoon prior to Super Bowl LV, and was headlined by Miley Cyrus, with guest appearances by Joan Jett and Billy Idol. Portions were aired during CBS's pre-game show, while the full concert was streamed on the TikTok app. While performing her song \"Wrecking Ball\", Cyrus broke down and said that it \"never gets easier\".\nA pre-game segment addressing racial unrest in the United States and the NFL's \"Inspire Change\" campaign featured a pre-recorded performance of \"Lift Every Voice and Sing\" by Alicia Keys from the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. National Youth Poet Laureate Amanda Gorman recited an original poem recognizing the game's three honorary captains participating in the coin toss ceremony, representing essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: Los Angeles teacher Trimaine Davis, Tampa nurse Suzie Dorner and Marine veteran James Martin.\nR&amp;B singer H.E.R. performed \"America the Beautiful\", and country music singer Eric Church and R&amp;B singer Jazmine Sullivan performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\". This was the second time that the national anthem was sung as a duet in a Super Bowl, the first time being in 2006. At the end of the national anthem, a flyover was performed by the United States Air Force consisting of their three strategic bombers currently in active service: The B-1 Lancer, the B-2 Spirit, and the B-52 Stratofortress.\nHalftime show.\nThe halftime show was headlined by the Weeknd. Dave Meyers was the show's executive producer, while Roc Nation produced and creatively directed. Additionally, Hamish Hamilton directed the performance. The show featured a number of his hit songs, including \"Can't Feel My Face\", \"Earned It\", and \"Blinding Lights\", among others.\nIt was reported that he had spent US$7 million of his own money on the show, which featured men dressed in all black with red jackets and bandages on their face as backup dancers. The halftime show garnered mixed reviews from critics, noting that while the logistical side of the performance was impressive, the lack of guest performers and the poor audio mixing were heavy drawbacks to the occasion.\nFor the first time since the Super Bowl XLIV halftime show, there was no crowd of fans surrounding the halftime stage. This has continued for subsequent Super Bowl halftime shows.\nGame summary.\nFirst half.\nKansas City won the coin toss and deferred possession to the second half. The opening kickoff from Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker was returned to the Tampa Bay 24-yard line. The Buccaneers' opening drive stalled to a three-and-out, and the resulting Bradley Pinion punt was downed at the Kansas City 33-yard line. The Chiefs' first drive ended similarly, with the offense able to gain only one first down and Tommy Townsend's punt resulting in a touchback. Tampa Bay's second drive started with a promising 13-yard rush by Ronald Jones II but stalled from there and resulted in another punt by Pinion, this one downed at the Chiefs' 38-yard line. Kansas City's ensuing drive took them 31 yards in eight plays, culminating in the first points of the game: a 49-yard field goal by Butker. On the next drive, Buccaneers running back Leonard Fournette rushed four times for 26 yards on an eight-play, 70-yard drive that ended on Tom Brady's eight-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, giving Tampa Bay a four-point lead. This was the 13th postseason touchdown pass from Brady to Gronkowski, setting a new record, which they had previously shared with Joe Montana and Jerry Rice. It was also the first time in Brady's 10 Super Bowls that he threw a touchdown pass in the first quarter. The Chiefs' next drive, which started on their own 37-yard line, ended in a three-and-out, and the Buccaneers took over on their own 30-yard line following the punt.\nOn their first drive of the second quarter, Brady's 31-yard completion to Mike Evans gave Tampa Bay a first and goal at the Chiefs six-yard line. However, the Bucs were only able to reach the Chiefs' one-yard line with their next three plays, and Ronald Jones II was stopped short of the goal line on a fourth down rushing attempt (a ruling that was challenged by Tampa Bay and upheld), giving the ball over on downs to Kansas City. The Chiefs were unable to capitalize off of the stop. The Chiefs' Tommy Townsend punted deep into Tampa Bay territory, but Kansas City was flagged for a holding call and had to punt again. Townsend's follow-up punt went out-of-bounds at the Chiefs' 38-yard line, for a net of only 29 yards. On the next drive, Brady threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, increasing the Buccaneers' lead to 14–3. The Buccaneers' drive was aided by two significant penalties – first, an interception by the Chiefs' Tyrann Mathieu was negated by defensive holding call. Later, after Kansas City stopped the Buccaneers on third down, the Chiefs' Mecole Hardman was called for offsides during the ensuing field goal attempt, giving the Buccaneers a first down as a result of the five-yard penalty. Kansas City responded by moving the ball 61 yards in 10 plays, with Patrick Mahomes completing three passes to Travis Kelce for 36 yards and rushing for 11. Butker finished the possession with another field goal, this from 34 yards, making the score 14–6. Tampa Bay's final first half drive began on their own 29-yard line with just over a minute on the clock, and increased their lead to 21–6 with a five-play, 71-yard drive, the longest a 15-yard catch by Fournette. Brady finished it with a one-yard touchdown pass to Antonio Brown with six seconds to play. Again, Tampa Bay was aided by penalties – in particular a 34-yard pass interference call against Bashaud Breeland who was covering Evans, and an eight-yard pass interference call against Mathieu in the end zone. All told, in the first half the Chiefs were penalized eight times for 95 yards – the most penalties called on any team in one half in any game of the 2020–21 NFL season, while the Buccaneers were flagged for one five-yard penalty. At halftime, the Buccaneers led the Chiefs 21–6.\nSecond half.\nThe second half began with a kickoff by Pinion, which was returned to the Chiefs' own 19-yard line. On the next play, Clyde Edwards-Helaire rushed for a 26-yard gain. Edwards-Helaire also had a 10-yard run on the drive, which went for 47 yards in seven plays and concluded with a 52-yard field goal, Butker's third of the game, cutting Kansas City's deficit to 21–9 and were only two touchdowns away from taking the lead. However, Tampa Bay completely took over the rest of the game and preventing any chance of a Chiefs comeback. The Buccaneers stormed right back with a six-play, 74-yard drive, featuring a 25-yard completion from Brady to Gronkowski (Brady's longest completion of the game). On the next play, Fournette's 27-yard touchdown burst increased the Bucs lead to 28–9. Following a touchback, Kansas City began their drive on their own 25-yard line, but an interception by Antoine Winfield Jr. at the Chiefs' 45-yard line gave Tampa Bay the ball back. Despite the fact that the Buccaneers were only able to gain eleven yards on their next eight plays, they were able to capitalize on the turnover, as Succop ended the drive with a 52-yard field goal, increasing their lead to 31–9. On the next drive, Tampa Bay forced a turnover on downs at their own 11-yard line with 13:43 left in the game, stuffing a running play for a one-yard gain and then forcing Mahomes to throw three straight incompletions.\nThe Chiefs defense forced Tampa Bay to punt for just the third time, allowing their offense to take the ball at their own eight-yard line. They got the ball across midfield, but turned the ball over to Tampa Bay on downs at the Bucs' 27-yard line. The Buccaneers then went three-and-out, and punted the ball to the Kansas City 42-yard line. Kansas City drove the ball to the Buccaneers 10-yard line, but Mahomes threw an interception to Devin White with 1:33 left in the game, which was downed in the end zone for a touchback. Brady then kneeled the ball three times for Tampa Bay, running out the clock, ending the game at 31–9. Brady, who completed 21 of 29 passes for 201 yards and three touchdowns, won the Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award for a record fifth time in his career.\nFournette was the game's leading rusher with 16 carries for 89 yards and a touchdown, while also catching four passes for 46 yards. Gronkowski, who caught only two passes in Tampa Bay's previous three postseason games, was the team's leading receiver with six receptions for 67 yards and two touchdowns. White had eight solo tackles (two for a loss), four assisted tackles, and an interception. Mahomes finished the day 26-of-49 for 270 yards and two interceptions, while also rushing for 33 yards. Kelce caught 10 passes for 133 yards, setting a new Super Bowl record for receiving yards by a tight end. Out of 110 Super Bowl teams, Kansas City became just the third to finish the game without scoring a touchdown, joining the Miami Dolphins in Super Bowl VI and the Los Angeles Rams in Super Bowl LIII. Buccaneers coach Bruce Arians became the oldest coach to win a Super Bowl, at 68 years and 127 days, while the team became the first to score at least 30 points in four games during the same postseason.\nFinal statistics.\nIndividual statistics.\nCompletions/attempts&lt;br&gt;Carries&lt;br&gt;Long gain&lt;br&gt;Receptions&lt;br&gt;Times targeted\nStarting lineups.\nBoth teams used a single set back formation as their base offense, with three wide receivers, one tight end and one running back. On defense, both teams used a variation of the nickel defense, as their base defense, with five defensive backs. Kansas City used a 4–2–5 variation with four down linemen and two linebackers, while Tampa Bay used a 2–4–5 with two down linemen and four linebackers. Kansas City's normal starter at left tackle, Pro Bowl selection Eric Fisher, was out with an achilles tendon injury he suffered in the AFC Championship Game. With his injury and others along the offensive line, the Chiefs were starting their fourth option on the depth chart at left tackle, third option at right guard, and third option at right tackle.\nOfficials.\nSuper Bowl LV featured seven officials. Sarah Thomas was the first woman to officiate a Super Bowl and any championship event in the major North American professional sports leagues. This was the first Super Bowl to have an alternate official for every position on the field since Super Bowl I. It was also the first time the replay official had a backup. The numbers in parentheses below indicate their uniform numbers."

        "title": "1976 World Team Tennis season",
        "text": "The 1976 World Team Tennis season was the third season of the top professional team tennis league in the United States. Led by regular season and playoff male most valuable player Sandy Mayer and female playoff most valuable player Billie Jean King, the New York Sets swept the San Francisco Golden Gaters in the WTT Finals to win the league championship.\nCompetition format.\nThe 1976 World Team Tennis season included 10 teams split into two divisions (Eastern and Western). Each team was scheduled to play a regular-season schedule of 44 matches.\nThe top two teams in each division qualified for the playoffs and met each other in the division championship series. The first-place team was given a choice of hosting either the first and third or second and third matches of the series. The division champions met in the best-of-five World Team Tennis Finals with the lower seed hosting the first two matches and the higher seed hosting the remaining matches.\nEach match comprised one set each of men's singles, women's singles, men's doubles, women's doubles and mixed doubles. Starting with this season, the order of play for the entire match was determined by the coach of the home team. Games were decided by the first player or doubles team to reach four points with no-ad scoring. Each set ended when one team had won either six or seven games and had an advantage over its opponent of at least two games. Sets that were tied 6–6 were decided by a tiebreaker. Set tiebreaker games were nine total points with the first player or doubles team to reach five the winner. An advantage of only one point was needed to win a tiebreaker game. Starting this season, if the team that won the final set was trailing in the match, the match went to overtime with the same players who participated in the final set remaining on the court. The leading team was required to win a game to end the match. If the match was tied at the end of five sets, or if the trailing team won enough games in overtime to tie the match, a super tiebreaker game was played between the players who participated in the final set using the same format as the set tiebreaker games.\nPlayer draft.\nWTT conducted its player draft for the 1976 season on December 11, 1975, at the Essex House in New York City. Teams made their selections in reverse order of their regular-season finish from the 1975 season. The players chosen in the first five rounds of the draft are listed in the tables below. The biggest news at the draft was the trade of the rights to Ilie Năstase by the New York Sets immediately after they used their third-round pick on him, to the Hawaii Leis. Năstase expressed interest in playing WTT but not in New York, because New York fans had widely criticized him for his on-court behavior and emotional outbursts. The Sets had previously agreed to allow the Leis to negotiate with Năstase with compensation going from Hawaii to New York if the Leis were to reach a deal with him. The Leis immediately announced that they had signed Năstase to a one-year contract worth in excess of $100,000. Leis owner Don Kelleher would not describe the amount with any more specificity than, \"It was six figures.\" The Leis sent undisclosed cash consideration and future draft picks to the Sets to complete the deal.\nStandings.\n\"Reference:\"\nPlayoff bracket.\n\"Reference:\"\nPlayoff match results.\n\"Reference:\"\nWTT Finals.\nOf the total of 8 playoff matches, home teams won 5 and lost 3. The higher seeds had 3 wins and 1 loss in their 4 home matches. The higher seeds won 2 of the 3 matchups.\nIndividual statistical leaders.\nThe table below shows the individual players and doubles teams who had the best winning percentages in each of the five events in WTT.\nIndividual honors.\n\"Reference:\"\nAll-Star Classic.\nThe 1976 WTT All-Star Classic was played on July 10, at Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum Arena in Oakland, California. The West overcame a 21–17 deficit after four sets when Betty Stöve and Dianne Fromholtz beat Martina Navratilova and Virginia Wade in a tiebreaker and then proceeded to win three consecutive overtime games to send the match to a super tiebreaker. A crowd of 12,581 fans watched both teams make substitutions for the super tiebreaker. Chris Evert entered for Fromholtz, while Billie Jean King and Evonne Goolagong replaced Wade and Navratilova. Evert forced Goolagong into an error to seal the West victory."

        "text": "The 2016 US Open was the 136th edition of tennis' US Open, the fourth and final Grand Slam event of the year. It took place on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City.\nIn the men's singles competition, Stan Wawrinka defeated defending champion Novak Djokovic in the final.\nAngelique Kerber defeated Karolína Plíšková in the women's singles to become the first German player to win the tournament since Steffi Graf in 1996. 2015 women's singles champion Flavia Pennetta did not defend her title as she had retired at the end of the 2015 season.\nThis tournament turned out to be the last one in the career of former No.1 player in the world and 2008 French Open women's singles champion Ana Ivanovic, who announced her retirement from professional tennis at the end of the year.\nTournament.\nThe 2016 US Open was the 136th edition of the tournament and it was held at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows–Corona Park of Queens in New York City, New York, United States.\nThe tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and was part of the 2016 ATP World Tour and the 2016 WTA Tour calendars under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consists of both men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. There are also singles and doubles events for both boys and girls (players under 18), which is part of the Grade A category of tournaments.\nIn addition, the annual men's and women's Champions Invitational doubles events were held, with eight male and eight female former Grand Slam champions taking part. For the third year running, the American Collegiate Invitational competitions were organized, where top sixteen American collegiate players compete in men's and women's singles events. Exhibition matches also took place.\nDue to the 2016 Summer Paralympics, no usual singles, doubles and quad events for men's and women's wheelchair tennis players as part of the UNIQLO tour under the Grand Slam category were played.\nThe tournament was played on hard courts and took place on a series of 17 courts with DecoTurf surface, including the three main showcourts – Arthur Ashe Stadium, Louis Armstrong Stadium, and the new Grandstand. It was the first US Open played on courts with operational roofs: on centre court and on the newly built Grandstand stadium. The Ashe roof was expected to be used only for rain, unlike the Australian Open, which also closes its roof in cases of extreme heat. It was also the last tournament before the demolition of Louis Armstrong Stadium and the old Grandstand. Arthur Ashe Stadium and the new Grandstand would be the existing main stadiums for the 2017 edition.\nFor the second year running, the US Open was scheduled across 14 days, rather than the 15-day schedule of 2013 and 2014, which impacted all senior events. Women's singles semifinals have been scheduled for September 8 evening session, while men's singles semifinal matches was played on Friday September 9. The men's doubles final was played before the women's singles final on Saturday, September 10, and the men's singles final followed the women's doubles final on Sunday, September 11.\nBroadcast.\nIn the United States, the 2016 US Open was the second under a new, 11-year, $825 million contract with ESPN, in which the broadcaster holds exclusive rights to the entire tournament and the US Open Series. This means that the tournament was not available on broadcast television. This also makes ESPN the exclusive U.S. broadcaster for three of the four tennis majors.\nLive action from a total of twelve courts was available this year (Arthur Ashe Stadium, Louis Armstrong Stadium, Grandstand, Court 4, Court 5, Court 6, Court 9, Court 11, Court 12, Court 13, Court 17 and Court P6/Old Grandstand), an increase from eleven in 2015.\nPoint and prize money distribution.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe total prize-money compensation for the 2016 US Open is $46.3 million, a 10% increase on the same total last year. Of that total, a record $3.5 million goes to both the men's and women's singles champions. This made the US Open the most lucrative and highest paying tennis grand slam in the world, leapfrogging Wimbledon in total prize money fund. Prize money for the US Open qualifying tournament is also up 10 percent, to $1.9 million.\nOn top of listed above, $600,000 will contribute Champions Invitational events prize money, while $1,478,000 is estimated as players' \"per diem\". A total of men's and women's singles prize money ($36,324,000) will account for more than 78% of total player compensation, while doubles ($5,463,000) and mixed doubles ($500,000) – for 12% and 1%, respectively.\nBonus prize money.\nThe top three men's and top three women's finishers in the 2016 US Open Series also earn bonus prize money at the US Open, with the champions of the Series Bonus Challenge having the opportunity to win $1 million in addition to their tournament prize money.\nChampions.\nSeniors.\nMen's singles.\nThe two players had met 23 times prior, with Djokovic winning on 19 occasions. This was Wawrinka's first appearance in the final of the tournament. Defending champion Djokovic started well, taking Wawrinka's first service game. Djokovic lost an opportunity to serve out the first set, and the set went into a tie-break. There Wawrinka won the third point but lost another seven, and Djokovic took the first set. In the second set, Wawrinka broke first to lead 3–1. Djokovic broke back and held serve to draw at 4–4, but lost his subsequent serve to allow Wawrinka to take the second set 6–4. Djokovic soon trailed 3–0 at the beginning of the third set but leveled it at 5–5. Wawrinka again broke serve in the final game to take the third set 7–5. Wawrinka started the fourth set like the last two, breaking Djokovic's first service game to lead 3–0. Djokovic received two medical timeouts midway through but was unable to prevent Wawrinka from winning the set 6–3 and his first US Open title.\nWomen's singles.\nKerber started the match as favorite to win, having assured the No. 1 women's ranking on September 12. Plíšková reached her first grand slam final, having never previously made it past the third round, by beating home favorite Serena Williams in the semi-finals. Kerber started strongly, breaking Plíšková's first service game and won the first set 6–3 with another break in serve. Plíšková fought back, breaking midway into the second set to take it into a deciding set. In the third set, Plíšková broke Kerber's second service game to lead, before Kerber leveled the set at 3–3. With the match at 5–4, Plíšková served to stay in the match but Kerber won it in a love game to secure her first US Open title.\nExternal links.\n \n "

        "text": "The Copa América Centenario final was a soccer match that took place on June 26, 2016 to determine the winner of the Copa América Centenario. It took place at MetLife Stadium at the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey, outside of the New York City.\nThe match was contested by Argentina and Chile, making it a rematch of the 2015 final. At this tournament, Argentina and Chile soon faced each other in Group D, and the victory belonged to Argentina with a score of 2–1. But in the final, like the last one, Chile ultimately won on penalty kicks after a 0–0 draw, with Chile scoring only their last 4 penalties after going first and 2 Argentines missing. However, Chile won 4-2 this time. Forward Lionel Messi announced his retirement from international soccer after the defeat, his fourth consecutive final defeat with Argentina, although he later reversed this decision.\nBackground.\nThis edition of the Copa América was the first hosted by the United States. The match marked the sixth time Argentina reached the final since the tournament was rebranded \"Copa América\" in 1975. They also finished in the top two in 22 editions of the tournament's predecessor, the \"Campeonato Sudamericano\", in which winners were decided in a single group stage with no final match. At this time, Argentina's last international tournament win had been the Copa America in 1993. Meanwhile, this was Chile's fourth final appearance, having also finished in the top two in 1955 and 1956. Chile were the defending champions, having won their first international title in the previous year's edition as the host nation.\nClosing ceremony.\nPitbull and Becky G performed the official song of the tournament, \"Superstar\", immediately following the match and trophy ceremony.\nMatch.\nAs part of FIFA's approval of rule changes based on IFAB's new regulations, a fourth substitute was allowed in extra time. However, neither team used the fourth substitution after the match went into extra time.\nDetails.\n&lt;section begin=m32 /&gt;&lt;section end=m32 /&gt;\n&lt;section begin=lineups /&gt;\n&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;section end=lineups /&gt;\nMatch rules\nPost-match.\nChile won their second consecutive final and defended the Copa América after their win in 2015, while Argentina lost their third consecutive final (preceded by the 2014 World Cup and 2015 Copa América). The match had an attendance of 82,026, the largest in the history of New Jersey.\nLionel Messi announced his retirement from international soccer after the match, saying \"I've done all I can. It hurts not to be a champion.\" Argentine newspaper \"La Nación\" speculated that other players, including Sergio Agüero, Javier Mascherano and Gonzalo Higuaín were set to retire. ESPN Deportes reported that Ángel Di María, Lucas Biglia, Ezequiel Lavezzi and Éver Banega could potentially retire as well. On August 12, 2016, Messi reverted his decision and announced his comeback to international soccer, saying \"There were too many things in my head during the day of the last final and I seriously thought about letting it go, but I love my country and this jersey so much.\" Three of the aforementioned players (Agüero, Di María and Messi) would eventually win their first international title at the Copa América five years later. They would also go on to win the 2022 World Cup, with Messi and Di Maria scoring in the final."

In the event of a tie, three sets of tiebreakers are employed: first, a 90-second swing-off (with no timeouts nor bonus time awarded); second, each player got three swings; whoever hit more home runs in the three swings would be declared the winner; thereafter, sudden death swings would occur until the tie was broken."

        "title": "World Snooker Championship (series)",
        "text": "The World Snooker Championship (WSC) is a series of video games based on snooker featuring licensing from the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. The first game in the series was released in 2001 and the last in 2011; a new licensed World Snooker game, Snooker 19, was released in 2019. The first four games were published by Codemasters and developed by Blade Interactive Software. Later games were published by Sega, Deep Silver and Koch Media.\nOverview.\nThe first game was simply named \"World Championship Snooker\" and released in 2000. In 2004, following a change in publisher, the series was renamed World Snooker Championship to better reflect the name of the tournament body and the actual tournament.\nIn 2005 the box art features the snooker player Paul Hunter who died in 2006 from cancer. When the game was re-released as a budget title from Sold-Out Software, he remained on the cover and in-game, but a memorial notice is included on the back of the case (\"Paul Hunter 1978 - 2006\").\nThe 2007 version is the first to feature fully licensed pool tournaments. In previous versions, pool is a side mode that can only be played in matches against the computer or other players.\nFrom 2008 onwards, the series was renamed WSC Real: World Snooker Championship. The branding was changed to reflect more realistic gameplay, including the ability to play in first person and view shots from any angle, and characters' lifelike emotions.\nTitles.\nWorld Championship Snooker.\nThe first game was released in 2000 for PlayStation and later in 2001 for Microsoft Windows. The box art features Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Mark Williams.\nWorld Championship Snooker 2002.\nWorld Championship Snooker 2002 was released on 28 September 2001 exclusively for PlayStation 2. The second game's box art also features Williams, Hendry and Sullivan. Gameplay on WCS 2002 improves from the previous version, and \"player aids\", such as a cueball line, shows the direction of the shot being played.\nWorld Championship Snooker 2003.\nWorld Championship Snooker 2003 was released on PlayStation 2, Xbox, and Microsoft Windows. The box art features world champions Peter Ebdon, Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan, John Higgins, Ken Doherty and Mark Williams. The game is the first in the series to feature pool modes, with both eight-ball and nine-ball pool included.\nThe game includes Big Break presenter John Virgo and a version of the \"John Virgo's Trick Shot\" mode in-game.\nWorld Championship Snooker 2004.\nWorld Championship Snooker 2004 was released on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Xbox. The box art features Stephen Hendry, Mark Williams, Steve Davis and Ronnie O'Sullivan. The 2004 edition features an expanded roster, including almost every member of the World Snooker Tour (except Jimmy White, likely due to him having his own licensed series of games), and licenses for official arenas such as the Crucible Theatre.\nThe game also introduced online multiplayer to the series, with players able to play single matches and tournaments. The game is the last in the series published by Codemasters.\nWorld Snooker Championship 2005.\nWorld Snooker Championship 2005 is the first licensed World Snooker Championship video game. The box art features Paul Hunter, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Steve Davis. This is the first game in the series with the name \"World Snooker Championship\". The game was published by Sega instead of Codemasters.\nThe game is also the first released on a handheld console, as the \"World Snooker Challenge 2005\" on the PlayStation Portable. The game features a playable \"League of Champions\" mode, where famous past snooker matches can be replayed. The game includes additional modes such as bar billiards. In \"free play\" mode, variables such as table size can be altered.\nWorld Snooker Championship 2007.\nWorld Snooker Championship 2007 was released on 12 January 2007. The box art features John Higgins, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Shaun Murphy. This is the first game in the series to be released on the seventh generation of consoles, with PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 releases. This installment also added a new mode called \"Golden Cue,\" where custom matches can be played.\nA new assist that would appear in all WSC games from this point on shows a provisional finishing position for the cue ball as a circular silhouette. This circle expands or retracts depending on the player's skill and difficulty of the shot involved.\nWorld Snooker Championship: Season 2007-08.\nWorld Snooker Championship: Season 2007-08 was released exclusively on Nintendo DS on 26 October 2007. The game's box art features Mark Selby and John Higgins. The game is the only release in the series for a Nintendo handheld console. The edition was panned for its lack of online play.\nWSC Real 08: World Snooker Championship.\nWSC Real 08: World Snooker Championship was released on 14 November 2008 for the Wii. The box art features Ronnie O'Sullivan and Steve Davis. The game is controlled with the Wii Remote, and was shipped with a cue attachment. The game was released on other consoles as WSC Real 09: World Snooker Championship. It was later released simultaneously for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on 3 April 2009. The version is identical apart from the addition of some graphical improvements.\nWSC Real 11: World Snooker Championship.\nWSC Real 11: World Snooker Championship was released on 15 April 2011 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The box art features Ronnie O'Sullivan. A gameplay function introduced in this edition is the ability to retake shots a certain number of times per game. The 2011 edition features improvements to the character creation system."

Each team in the USPBL plays a 42-game regular season schedule from May through September, with a mid-season all-star game and a championship game at the conclusion of the regular season. The games are played at Jimmy John's Field in Utica, Michigan. Most of the games are broadcast live on the USPBL's YouTube channel, with select games airing on ESPN3.\nHistory.\nThe United Shore Professional Baseball League was founded by Andy Appleby, a former senior vice president of the Detroit Pistons and Palace Sports and Entertainment. Justin Orenduff, a former First Round Pick of the Los Angeles Dodgers, is the Director of Baseball Operations.\nThe league has four teams based in Metro Detroit, with all games being played at Jimmy John's Field in Utica, Michigan. The $12 million ballpark has seating for 2,000 and a total capacity of 4,000. It was built on capped brownfield that previously served as an unlicensed dump for household waste. \nThe league is aimed at 18- to 25-year-olds who either went undrafted out of college, or who have been released from prior minor league contracts. Their pay is expected to range from $600–$800 per month, with housing provided by host families. It is meant to give players recently graduated from college or with limited minor league experience a chance to stay in baseball shape, and give them an opportunity to be signed to contracts with MLB affiliated minor league teams. League revenue comes primarily from sponsorship partners and other advertisements, ticket sales and ballpark concessions. Current managers in the league include former Major League Baseball players Jim Essian, Paul Noce, and Von Joshua.\nForty-five players from the USPBL have signed contracts with Major League Baseball organizations. During the 2019 season, pitcher Randy Dobnak became the first alum to advance all the way to the Major Leagues when he was called up to the Minnesota Twins on August 8, 2019. A second USPBL alum, Logan Gillaspie, was called up to the Baltimore Orioles on May 17, 2022. A third USPBL player, Jared Koenig, made his MLB debut with the Oakland Athletics during the 2022 season."

        "title": "Universal Tennis Rating",
        "text": "Universal Tennis Rating (UTR) is a global tennis player rating system intended to produce an objective, consistent, and accurate index of players' skill in the game of tennis. UTR rates all players on a single 16-point scale, without regard to age, gender, nationality, or locale of a given match. All professional players in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and the Women’s Tennis Association (WTA) have UTRs, as do most college players and many junior tournament players worldwide, as well as many adult league and tournament players. The UTR database includes results from more than 8 million matches and 200+ countries. More than 800,000 players have UTRs.&lt;ref name=\"https://blog.universaltennis.com/2018/01/03/universal-tennis-partners-with-tennis-channel/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nPlayers, coaches, tournament directors, tennis clubs, tennis leagues, and national federations employ UTR in varied ways. These include selecting entrants for recruiting players for college teams, scheduling competitive matches with other teams or individuals, finding appropriate local playing or training partners, and others. UTR is the official rating system of the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA). In January 2018, the Tennis Channel announced its partnership with UTR, making the rating system part of the Tennis Channel's coverage of events.&lt;ref name=\"http://www.tennisindustry.org/cms/index.cfm/news/universal-tennis-partners-with-tennis-channel/\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nDefinition of Universal Tennis Rating.\nUniversal Tennis Rating (UTR) is an index intended to be reliable and accurate that rates players' tennis skill. UTR rates all players—men, women, and children—on a single 16-point scale (with two decimal places, e.g., 11.29) that works for players globally regardless of their skill level, from beginners to top professional competitors.\nUTR's algorithm calculates ratings from the last 30 eligible matches played within the preceding 12 months. The main data points are the percentage of games won (not simply the won/lost result), and the opponent’s rating. Each match played generates a rating. A player’s UTR is a weighted average of all eligible matches.\nRatings versus Rankings.\nAlthough tennis is a global sport, it does not have a common international rating system. Tennis has nothing comparable to the handicap system (though in France \"les classements par handicaps\" (classifications by handicap) and \"les classements par rangs\" (classifications by ranks) has a handicap built into their ratings) in golf for example, which enables all golfers to record their scores on specific courses, generating a handicap that is valid on any golf course in the world.\nIn tennis, the vast majority of competitive players enter events only in their geographical locale. Whatever ranking they earn has meaning only within that region or country. Worldwide, hundreds of national federations govern tennis, and multiple ranking systems frequently exist within a single nation. There may be as many as 2,700 different tennis ranking and rating systems around the world.\nFurthermore, nearly all of these are \"ranking\" systems, not \"rating\" systems. Rankings sort players into a \"pecking order,\" assigning each athlete a spot relative to all others ranked in that system. Rankings are ordinal numbers that reflect only the athletes' relative positions, not their playing skill as measured by a standard yardstick.\nUTR, in contrast, rates each athlete on a single, standard metric. Therefore, tennis players' UTRs are largely independent of each other, aside from the algorithm's weighting of the strength of opponents who compete directly with the rated player.\nNearly all tennis ranking systems use a \"points per round\" (PPR) method that assigns points depending on what round a player reaches in a given tournament, along with the rated \"strength\" of that tournament in terms of the players it accepts into the draw. This is administratively easy, but it does not consider the skill level of the individual opponents a player faced in the event. Paradoxically, the PPR method can create an incentive to seek out \"weaker\" tournaments, in which it will be easier to survive into later rounds.\nThe plethora of ranking systems and the lack of a shared metric has created a “Tower of Babel” in international tennis. National federations, tournaments, coaches, teams, colleges, and individual players speak different languages that do not readily translate into one another. Consequently, the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and many of tennis' national governing bodies, including the United States Tennis Association (USTA), have become interested in developing a standard rating method, a kind of \"metric system\" for tennis that, like a golf handicap, could function globally.\n“The UTR system is great for tennis in so many ways,” said former ATP Player Council president Eric Butorac, in a 2015 \"Sports Illustrated\" story on UTR. “At a UTR event, you are guaranteed to play against players who are close to your ability level. I have played a lot in France, where they have a similar system, and it works so efficiently. I hope the whole world gets on board with UTR, as it could drastically change worldwide tennis for the better.”\nHistory of Universal Tennis Rating.\nVirginia tennis professional Dave Howell launched UTR in 2008 as a private company to promote the rating system he developed and tested successfully in southeastern Virginia. Alex Cancado, a tennis player and web designer in the area, developed an algorithm to operationalize Howell’s rating system. Howell brought in some early followers as partners and began to concentrate full-time on developing the UTR.\nIn his coaching career, Howell had mentored junior players from the United States who entered French tournaments. Juniors in the U.S. compete under various ranking systems, including a widely used PPR system administered by the USTA. In contrast, France employs a national rating system based on head-to-head won/lost results. This enables French tournament directors to facilitate \"level-based play\" — orchestrating matches between players of comparable skill, often without regard to their age or gender. French tournaments often use staggered-entry draws that allow stronger players to enter a tournament in later rounds. This design enables a single event to embrace a wide range of skill levels, from club players up to touring professionals, but the French classification system ensures a high probability of even matches for entrants at all levels.\nHowell found that the yielded events that were, overall, far more competitive than junior events in the U.S. To study why this was so, he defined a \"competitive\" match as one in which the losing player wins more than half the minimum number of games needed to win the match. In the common \"best 2-of-3 set\" format, that equals seven games, as the winner must take at least 12 games to capture the match. Hence, a result of 6-3, 6-4 or closer reaches the \"competitive threshold,\" as defined by UTR. After statistically analysing thousands of USTA boys' and girls' junior tournament matches at all levels, Howell found that on average, only about one match in four (27 percent) was competitive; USTA national junior events reached the 40 percent level.\nHowell modelled UTR on the French system, developing, with his colleagues, an algorithm that calculated ratings from head-to-head results with specific opponents, taking their rated skill into account. He and his colleagues also made UTR more precise than the French system by entering the number of \"games\" won in a match, not only the won/lost result. The use of Howell's rating system in Virginia produced junior tournaments with substantially more competitive matches — a rate that equalled the 50-60 percent level typically seen at the top tiers of college and professional tennis.\nThe Founders of the Universal Tennis Rating are: Dave Howell, Darryl Cummings, Alexandre Cancado, Steve Clark, Niclas Kohler, Johan Varverud, Raquel Araujo Kohler, and Patricia Araujo Cancado. \nAdoption and Usage of UTR.\nUTR gradually spread from Virginia to other tennis venues in the United States, particularly in junior events which, as noted, often include many non-competitive matches. The system also gained traction in college tennis, which in recent decades has evolved into a truly global sport that embraces young athletes from all tennis-playing nations. But the prevalence of so many ranking and rating systems in international tennis confronted college coaches in the United States with serious problems evaluating the calibre of international recruits. By offering a standard, reliable index of skill applicable worldwide, UTR answered this quandary. Consequently, in recent years UTR has become a \"gold standard\" for assessing collegiate tennis recruits, both internationally and domestically. UTR also helps recruits match themselves with appropriate college programs.\nA leading proponent of UTR, Dave Fish, head men’s tennis coach at Harvard University, states that “The Universal Tennis Rating system is now being recognized by many college coaches as the best metric available for judging junior talent. While the recruiting benefits of UTR are evident for both coaches and recruits, the widespread use of the Universal Tennis approach to tournament play promises to transform the entire player development system of tennis in America.”\nSince 2011, the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA), the governing body for college tennis in the U.S., has worked closely with Universal Tennis and now relies on UTR data to determine event seeding at U.S. college invitationals; seeding and selection for its 51 ITA/Oracle Summer Circuit tournaments; and seeding and selection in the Oracle ITA Junior Masters events. In 2016, the ITA made UTR its official rating system for college tennis in the United States.\nUTR also extended into the professional game, where all ATP and WTA players now have UTRs.\nNational federations have recognized the value of UTR for attracting players to tennis and for developing their skill through competitive matches. Currently more than 40 national tennis federations have committed to submitting tournament results to UTR. These include the Lawn Tennis Association of Great Britain, Tennis Canada, Tennis Australia, the Brazilian Tennis Confederation, and the Bulgarian Tennis Federation.\nIn January 2018, the Tennis Channel announced its partnership with UTR, making the rating system part of the Tennis Channel's coverage of competition.\nAt the same time, a new ownership group assumed control of UTR, which is based in San Francisco, California. Universal Tennis’s chairman and CEO is Mark Leschly, founder and managing partner of Iconica Partners, a global investment firm specializing in the intersection of technology, sports, and media, which heads the new ownership. The group's partners include Mark Hurd, CEO of Oracle Corporation; Ken Hao, managing partner of Silver Lake Partners; Jan Leschly, former CEO of SmithKline Beecham, a former top-ten ATP player and former chairman of the International Tennis Hall of Fame; Ken Solomon, president of the Tennis Channel; the Tennis Media Company; Major League Baseball; and the Los Angeles Dodgers' ownership group.\nConcept of Universal Tennis Rating.\nRecreational tennis — friends hitting with each other or playing games — accounts for the majority of tennis. But at the competitive level, junior play in the United States and elsewhere sorts players into age groups. Typically, this means separate tournaments for players aged 12-and-under, 14-and-under, 16-and-under, and 18-and-under. Tournaments also separate boys and girls into separate draws. Adult events normally sort entrants by half-decades, using minimum instead of maximum ages (35-and-over, 40-and-over, etc.) Separating players into groups by age and gender does organize draws simply, but it also throws together competitors in ways that are unrelated to their tennis skill.\nEntry to, and seedings in, tournaments typically derive from players’ \"rankings\". These in turn depend on PPR amassed in previous tournaments, regardless of opponents' strengths or actual match scores. The resulting draws often pit top players against much lower-ranked athletes, especially in early rounds, frequently leading to one-sided matches.\nIn contrast, designing draws or flights with UTR consistently produces many more matches between athletes of roughly equal ability. Two players whose UTRs fall within 1.0 of each other will have a competitive match two to three times as often as those with ratings more than 1.0 apart. Furthermore, research has shown that when players' UTRs differ by more than 1.0 point, the lower-rated athlete will upset his or her higher-rated opponent only 3 percent of the time.\nClose, competitive contests are widely recognized by coaches as the most powerful engine for developing tennis skill. Even matches benefit both players. Non-competitive, one-sided matches, in contrast, typically discourage the loser and fail to challenge the winner, offering neither one much opportunity to improve his or her skills.\nThe Universal Tennis Rating Scale.\nUniversal Tennis Ratings are expressed as a number with up to two decimal points falling between 1.0 and 16.50, e.g., 9.46. UTR's 16-point scale embraces everyone from beginners through intermediate recreational and competitive players, to active tournament and college varsity athletes, and ranging up to the highest levels of the game at the top professional ranks.\nFor example, as of January 2018, Rafael Nadal of Spain held a UTR of 16.27 and Switzerland's Roger Federer was at 16.21. In that month, Serena Williams of the United States reached a rating of 13.44 while Simona Halep of Romania reached a rating of 13.38 later that year. In April of 2022, Ash Barty reached a rating of 13.42. In 2023, Novak Djokovic reached a UTR of 16.46 and Carlos Alcaraz reached a UTR of 16.43.\nThe vast majority of UTRs derive from sanctioned tournament results. Universal Tennis regularly records results from all ATP, WTA, and ITF Junior and Futures events; all sanctioned USTA junior events, and all ITA (Intercollegiate Tennis Association) and NCAA dual matches and tournaments. UTR also incorporates results from a growing number of national federations. It updates and maintains ratings for more than 800,000 current competitors, and its database includes 8 million match results. To ensure verification, UTR only accepts match results that have been published on the internet.\nEach rated player has a profile on the UTR website, with a singles and doubles rating based on up to 30 of the most recent matches played in a 12-month period. These profiles display the match scores along with competitors’ names and ratings. Profiles also include hometowns and, when applicable, the player's college or school team. College teams, and a growing number of high-school teams, have profile pages of their own, listing their varsity athletes and associated rating data.\nIn addition to including the percentage of matches that reached the competitive threshold, profiles indicate the reliability of the displayed ratings. When a new player first appears in published and/or sanctioned tournament results, that player’s rating will have a low reliability percentage. Once the athlete has played five or more matches against opponents with 100-percent reliable ratings, his/her own rating will be certified as 100 percent reliable."

        "text": "The British Esports Federation (also known as British Esports) is the national body for esports (or competitive video gaming) in the United Kingdom. It was established in March 2016 as the British Esports Association to help develop the UK's grassroots esports scene and provide an infrastructure to nurture future talent.\nOrganization.\nThe association's chair is Andy Payne OBE, who has worked for the Mastertronic software publishing group, AppyNation, Just Flight and is a board member of UKIE, the trade body for the UK games industry. Former Minister and MP Ed Vaizey joined the association as vice chair in October 2017. Andy Miah joined as advisory board member in November 2019.\nHistory.\nIn April 2017, British Esports announced its first game advisers, who provide input and expertise to make sure the association can support and understand each game's community effectively.\nBritish Esports held an after-school esports club pilot scheme for school children at Maida Vale Library in Summer 2017.\nBritish Esports joined Ukie in early 2018, the Creative Industries Federation and the Sport and Recreation Alliance, as well as being a prominent member of the Global Esports Federation.\nIn early 2018, the inaugural British Esports Championships were announced. The pilot Championships for schools and colleges ran from February to April 2018 and the first full Championships ran from October 2018, in partnership with Twitch Student and AoC Colleges Sport, concluding with finals at the Insomnia Gaming Festival in 2019. Following a rebrand in 2021, the British Esports Student Champs runs in two splits (Winter and Spring) across the academic year for students to compete for a spot at the live grand finals event. The 2022 Grand Finals are set to be held in conjunction with the Confetti Institute of Creative Technologies in Nottingham.\nIn September 2018, British Esports teamed up with West Ham United Foundation, London Sport, Archery GB and GAME to host an activity week merging esports with sport, including football, archery and Rocket League.\nIn December 2021, Team Great Britain and Northern Ireland competed in the first-ever Global Esports Games in Singapore. Teams competed in Dota 2, Street Fighter V, and eFootball PES against one another, with the Dota 2 Women's team coming home with a silver medal at the end of the event.\nIn January 2022, it was announced that British Esports will be opening the National Esports Performance Centre in Sunderland. The campus will act as a headquarters for the organisation, and will allow for further developments to the esports scene throughout the United Kingdom.\nIn February 2022, it was announced that the pilot for the Commonwealth Esports Championships is being supported by British Esports. The tournament will take place alongside the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham in July 2022.\nStudent Champs.\nThe British Esports Student Champs cover 4 main esports titles: \"Rocket League\", \"League of Legends\", \"Overwatch 2\" and \"Valorant\". Each tournament consists of a Winter Season with initial regionalisation and divisions, and a Spring Season with the chance of promotion into an higher division or the Nationals. Teams can enter in the Spring Season without completing the Winter Season, but they will have to go through the same seeding process to determine their division placement.\nSince 2021 the Spring Season/Split sees the introduction of the \"AOC Sport FIFA Cup\", and would normally involve the current version of the game. The \"AOC Sport FIFA 22 Cup\" contained two leagues for XBOX and Playstation, due to the lack of cross-platform play in the FIFA series."

Originally the World Feed only existed for the 2020 season, but it was brought back for the WNBA on Ion Friday night games in 2023. \nTwitter.\nTwitter signed up to carry 10 WNBA broadcasts in 2020 and carried the contract over to 2021. The games focus more on analytics and use a mix of local pxp and analysts from the G League and the WNBA. \nNBA TV.\nNBAtv will carry select games throughout the season. These games will remain available on WNBA League Pass and will be a simulcast of the world feed television broadcast.\nCBS Sports Network.\nBeginning with the 2019 season CBSSN entered into a contract to broadcast a minimum of 40 WNBA games per season. It is a multi-year deal, but the length of the deal wasn't announced.\nWNBA League Pass.\nEvery game not broadcast on an ESPN Network or CBSSN is carried live for everyone to watch on WNBA League Pass. No blackouts apply outside of the ESPN and CBSSN productions."

The club currently competes in the Football League, the second tier of the Greek football league system, and hosts its home games at the Pankritio Stadium, the city's largest and most modern sports venue. Ergotelis F.C. is one of the two Heraklion-based football clubs to have competed in the Greek Superleague, the country's top-level football competition, having made a total of 9 appearances during 2004–2015. The club's best finish in the competition is 7th place during the 2013–14 season. It has also won the Beta Ethniki (second tier of the Greek football league system) once, in 2006, as well as the Greek Football Amateur Cup in 1983.\nOther football departments maintained by Ergotelis include Neoi Ergoteli (Greek: Νέοι Εργοτέλη, \"Young Ergotelis (♂)\"), Kanaria Ergoteli (Greek: Κανάρια Εργοτέλη, \"Ergotelis' Canaries\") and the 2016-established Martinengo (Greek: Μαρτινένγκο). All of the aforementioned clubs are run through the Ergotelis Youth Academy, consisting primarily of young athletes registered in the club's infrastructure segments, based in the privately owned \"Ergotelis Athletic Centre\". The club has determined for these teams to compete in various regional competitions of the Heraklion FCA football league system, passing on promotion rights in favor of internally moving players to the higher divisions on age-based criteria, as well as signing outstanding players to Ergotelis F.C. an its U-19 squad instead. All aforementioned teams host their home games at the Nikos Kazantzakis Stadium.\nWomen's.\nErgotelis has traditionally maintained a strong senior Women's football department. \"Nees Ergoteli\" (Greek: Νέες Εργοτέλη, \"Young Ergotelis (♀)\") was Ergotelis' women's team in the Pan-Hellenic Women's Football Championship for many years. It is the most successful Women's Football Club in Crete, clinging to a 4th-place finish in the highest professional women's football league in Greece and reaching the Greek Women's Cup semi-finals during the 2015−2016 season. Many of the club's athletes have received multiple call-ups for the Greek women's national football team as a result of the club's success. However, internal disputes led to the club's board of directors to decide to dissolve the club in September 2016, \"«aiming to purge people and practices that are inappropriate for the ethos and history of Ergotelis»\". They are currently playing in the Gamma Ethniki, the third tier in the league structure.\nIn 2012, Ergotelis established a second women's football department, named after the parent club \"G.S. Ergotelis\" (Greek: Γ.Σ. Εργοτέλης) and consisting primarily of younger athletes from the club's training academies. After shutting down Nees Ergoteli in 2016, this club became the senior Ergotelis Women's football department. After its internal promotion to senior squad, Ergotelis won back-to-back Division titles in both the Gamma and Beta Ethniki, third and second tiers of the Greek women's football league system, thus managing a swift return of Ergotelis Women's football back to top-flight. They since compete in the Pan-Hellenic Women's Football Championship, the top tier of the Greek women's football league system.\nBasketball.\nThe club's men's basketball department was founded in 1968, the same year it joined the registers of the Greek Federation of Sporting Clubs. In 1983, Ergotelis was one of the clubs that signed the establishment of the Cretan Basketball Associations Union. Currently, both men's and women's basketball departments are amateur clubs, that host home games at the Lido Indoor Hall in Heraklion, a basketball court with a capacity of 1,400 spectators.\nThe men's basketball department currently competes in the Cretan Basketball League, and holds the record for most regional titles won in Crete, having won a total of 15 regional Championships and two Cretan Cups, since the Cretan Local Basketball Committee, the governing body of basketball on the island, was founded in 1968 (and replaced by the Cretan Basketball Associations Union in 1983). It was the first Cretan basketball club to debut in national competitions in 1977, and first club managed by legendary Greek basketball coach, Giannis Ioannidis."

        "text": "The 1919–20 Chicago Maroons men's basketball team represented the University of Chicago.\nRegular season.\nThe 1919–20 Chicago Maroons men's basketball season was the final of nine seasons for head coach Pat Page. This group was first Big Ten champion in ten years for the Maroons. The campaign began with a three-game home winning streak, a loss to Iowa, followed by a seven-game winning streak. The team would play 12 conference games with only two defeats. The Maroons were led by captain Paul Hinkle, who would go on to coach Butler University in basketball as well as football for nearly 50 years. Complementing Hinkle at guard, the Maroons also started Herbert \"Fritz\" Crisler who also would create a legacy for himself as a coach and athletic director. Additionally, the team rounded out the starting five with combinations of Clarence Vollmer, Robert Birkhoff and Ted Curtiss at forward, Harry Williams and Robert Halladay at center.\nAt seasons end, Paul \"Tony\" Hinkle, was named an All-American, while also being named 1st-team all-conference guard. For Hinkle, it was his second consecutive All-American honor and it was the third consecutive all-conference award. Crisler and Vollmer would be named to the all-conference honorable mention team for the 1920 season with Crisler being named defensive player of the year.\nNational Collegiate Championship Series.\nAt the end of the regular season, Chicago sat at the top of the Big Ten and was considered the champion of the Western Intercollegiate Conference. Simultaneously the Penn Quakers had won the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference. To decide the 1920 national collegiate basketball championship a series of three games was arranged between the two champions. On March 22, 1920, the first game was played before a crowd of 3,600 fans in Bartlett Gymnasium. The champions of the east would fall behind the Maroons at the half by a score of 17–6; however, the final score of the game would be much tighter at 28–24. In the game both Vollmer and Birkhoff each scored 12 points, while Curtiss and Halladay each added a basket.\nThe second game was played at the University of Pennsylvania's gymnasium which was also the YMCA. The Maroons were not equipped to play in a facility such as this and struggled to a 10–10 halftime score. But, in the end, the champions of the west would succumb to the Quakers and be defeated by a final score of 29–18. In the game both Hinkle and Halladay would foul out as the Maroons would be the recipients of 20 fouls, allowing the Quakers to have multiple free throw opportunities.\nThe final game was played on the campus of Princeton University within the University Gymnasium. Back on a familiar setting and playing on a semi-neutral court, the Maroons played a very close game. In the end, the Quakers would come out on top by a score of 23–21 and win the Intercollegiate National Championship."

        "text": " \nClimbing palms are genera in the family Arecaceae that grow as lianas. \"Initially erect, the slender stems seek out trees for support and climb up into the forest canopy by means of recurved hooks and spines growing on the stem, leaves and inflorescences. In all climbing palms the leaves are pinnate and grow along the stem instead of forming a dense crown. The stems of climbing palms, more often referred to as canes, are solid in contrast to bamboo poles which are almost always hollow.\" \"The majority of climbing palms are also clumping palms [and sympodial], sending out new shoots from [below ground as suckers].\" \"About 600 species of palms in [16] genera have a climbing growth habit. Most noteworthy is the genus \"Calamus\"--the largest genus in the palm family with approximately 350 described species--source of nearly all commercial rattan.\"\nThe habit of \"climbing palm\" is one of the terms used for referring to the diversity of habits of palm stems, the rest are \"arborescent palms\" or tree palms, \"shrub palms\" and \"acaulescent palms\", as defined in Dransfield (1978 cited in Kubitzki ed. 1998, see also Uhl &amp; Dransfield 1987 \"Genera Palmarum\").\nDiversity.\nMost climbing palms are the ones called rattan. Rattans are closely related and all belong to the family Calamoideae, most of them in the tribe Calameae. The genera: \"Calamus\", principally, also \"Korthalsia\", \"Plectocomia\", \"Plectocomiopsis\", \"Myrialepis\", \"Laccosperma\" (syn. \"Ancistrophyllum\"), \"Eremospatha\" and \"Oncocalamus\". All rattans belong to the Old World.\nIn the New World there are 2 genera with climbing representatives, \"Chamaedorea\" (subfamily Ceroxyloxideae, tribe Hyophorbeae) and \"Desmoncus\" (subfamily Arecoideae, tribe Cocoseae), the last one is utilized and commercialized much in the same way as rattans.\n\"Dypsis scandens\" (subfamily Arecoideae, tribe Areceae) is a climbing palm in Madagascar."

She grew up in Scone, New South Wales. At the age of 28, a horse riding accident led to her fibula splitting and crushing into the bottom of her foot and a fall six weeks later caused further damage to her leg. After 20 operations in two years, her ankle was fused and her achillies tendon cut, she has less than 15 per cent movement in her ankle joint. She works as a dressage trainer and instructor.\nEquestrian.\nMartin's heritage is in the equestrian world as she grew up in a family of Australian Stock Horse breeders in Scone. In her youth, she competed in eventing, polocrosse, showjumping and dressage and trained under the guidance of Rozzie and Olympian Heath Ryan. Fourteen years after the accident, she was approached to consider riding in para-equestrian events. Initially, Martin declined the offer to compete against people in a wheelchair. Martin was then told that wasn't the way paras worked, and was told the classifications and explained how they did work. Martin was classified as a Grade IV rider. Although she still competes in able bodied events, Martin said para-equestrian has become very professional. She continued on by saying there's a lot of support and the people involved are \"incredible to deal with\".\nAt the 2016 Rio Paralympics, she rode First Famous, a German Warmblood mare. She finished fourth in three events - the Individual Championship Test Grade IV, Dressage individual Team Test Grade IV and Individual Freestyle Test Grade IV and was a member of the Australian Team that finished ninth in the Team Competition."

The ODI matches were in preparation for the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, which took place in England and Wales during June. Extra security was provided to South Africa for the ODI series following the Manchester Arena bombing. England won the ODI series 2–1 and the T20 series 2–1.\nAhead of the ODI series, South Africa played one-day warm-up matches against Northamptonshire and Sussex. South Africa were scheduled to play a Twenty20 tour match against Leicestershire, but this was cancelled due to a clash with the Champions Trophy. Prior to the Test series, South Africa played a three-day game against the England Lions at Worcester.\nFor the Test series, Joe Root captained England for the first time. For South Africa, their Test captain Faf du Plessis missed the first Test following the birth of his first child. Dean Elgar replaced him as captain, leading South Africa for the first time. England went on to win the Test series 3–1, their first home series win against South Africa since 1998.

They also played a two-day match against Leicestershire, as they did not get to the final of the 2017 NatWest t20 Blast.\nIn October 2016 the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) confirmed that the first Test at Edgbaston would be played as a day/night game. Tom Harrison, chief executive of the ECB, said that \"we are excited by the prospect of staging our first ever day-night Test match\". Following the Edgbaston Test match, both England's Alastair Cook and Neil Snowball, CEO of Warwickshire County Cricket Club, said that the \"jury is out\" with regards to holding another day/night Test in England. The ECB considered it a success, with the possibility of having a day/night Test as an annual fixture. England won the Test series 2–1, with James Anderson taking his 500th wicket in the third match.\nThe West Indies won the one-off T20I match at the Riverside Ground by 21 runs. In the opening ODI match, England won by 7 wickets, meaning that the West Indies would need to play in the 2018 Cricket World Cup Qualifier tournament, as they were not able to qualify directly for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. England's preparation for the fourth ODI was disrupted following the arrest of Ben Stokes in Bristol after the third ODI. Following the incident, both Stokes and Alex Hales were suspended by the ECB, meaning they would not be considered for selection for England until further notice. Despite this, England went on to win the ODI series 4–0.\nSquads.\nSam Billings was added to the England squad ahead of the fourth ODI, and Dawid Malan before the fifth, following the arrest of Ben Stokes and his and Alex Hales's subsequent suspension. Carlos Brathwaite was added to the West Indies' squad for the fifth ODI as a replacement for Jason Holder who went home to attend a funeral. Jason Mohammed was made captain for the match in Holder's absence."

        "text": "The 2008 Ana Ivanovic tennis season officially began on 8 January with the start of the 2008 Medibank International Sydney in Sydney and ended with the 2008 WTA Tour Championships. Ivanovic entered the season as the number four ranked player and the defending champion at three tournaments and finalist at previous year's French Open.\nDuring the season, Ivanovic reached second Grand Slam final at Australian Open which she lost, but at the next one at French Open she won her first Grand Slam trophy. With semifinal win, she assured becoming the World No. 1 and being the first Serbian to do so. Ivanovic held the top spot for 12 non-consecutive weeks, but finished the year as number five.\nIn 2008, Ivanovic won Sony Ericsson WTA Tour Diamond ACES Award, German Tennis Magazine Michael Westphal Award and International Tennis Writer's Association Ambassador of the Year 2008.\nYear in details.\nAustralian Open series.\nHong Kong exhibition.\nDespite Ivanovic officially began season playing in Sydney, she participated also in an exhibition tournament in Hong Kong, when was the first week of new tennis season. Exhibition is constructed of eight players playing in knock-out system, starting from quarterfinal stage. Six of the eight players were in the world's top 10 at the moment. Ivanovic was first seed and was drawn to play against fifth seed Elena Dementieva. She eventually lost 4–6, 6–1, 3–6. After losing in group named Golden Group, she played another match in Silver Group for players who lost their quarterfinal matches. However, Ivanovic looked now indifferently playing dead rubber, and lost 1–6, 3–6 to Shuai Peng.\nMedibank International.\nIvanovic's first tournament of the year was at Medibank International. All players from top 4 competed, so she was seeded just fourth with the ranking of number four. After receiving bye in the first round, she won tight first match of the year against number 30 Virginie Razzano, coming back from 2–5 to win 6–1, 2–6, 7–5. Playing in the quarterfinals against two spots better ranked player, Katarina Srebotnik, Ivanovic won easier with 6–2 in third set. In the semifinals, opponent was number 1, Justine Henin, whom she has never beaten before. This time she was closest to winning, but lost a very tight match with the score of 2–6, 6–2, 4–6. Ivanovic rose to world number three for the first time after this tournament.\nAustralian Open.\nDespite being new world number three, Ivanovic was seeded fourth as points from Sydney didn't affect the rankings because of it being played when the Australian Open draw was already out. Ivanovic's first opponent was Sorana Cîrstea, the only player outside the top 100 which she played against at this tournament. She won in tight two straight sets. In the next round however, she lost just three games against Tathiana Garbin, including bagel in the first set. In third and fourth round she won both matches in straight sets, against 28th seed Katarina Srebotnik and Danish youngster, the future No. 1, Caroline Wozniacki. Though she missed likes of Justine Henin and Serena Williams, whom she has never beaten before, in her side of the draw, opponent in the quarterfinal was eight seed Venus Williams, who also never lost a match to Ivanovic at that point. However, Ivanovic showed no signs of fear and beat older Williams sister for the first time, 7–6, 6–4. Ivanovic was serving at 4–2 and was point from 5–2 lead in first set but however the set gone to tiebreak which she won 7–3. In second set, she came roaring back from 0–3, winning six of the next seven games. The win was also significant because of breaking the barrier as Ivanovic lost at both previous Grand Slams in last season just to Venus. She was given the nickname \"Aussie Ana\" during the on-court interview with Todd Woodbridge following the victory over Williams.\nIn semifinals she played against ninth seed Daniela Hantuchová. Match started badly for Ivanovic, and fast she was 0–6, 0–2 down. Although just trying to get on the board at the moment, since winning that first game in the third game of the set, things got better, as she subsequently broke back and soon closed set after breaking later again and served the set out. In decider, both were holding serve until four all. Ivanovic got break point and immediately after found herself in the position to close the match out. She did it at love, winning with 0–6, 6–3, 6–4 scoreline. Despite having not reached even fourth round at event before, now she reached the final. But however, she lost the match to fifth seed Maria Sharapova, losing her second Grand Slam final. Though she was close to win the first set at 5–4 and 0–30 when Maria served, she missed the chance to take the first set, and eventually lost in straight sets, 5–7, 3–6.\nFed Cup.\nOnly few days after Australian campaign, Ivanovic flew to Budapest to play Fed Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group I with fellow top 10 Sebian player Jelena Janković. Consequences of fatigue were seen as she won two of three matches in tight three sets. In round robin they faced Poland and Romania, and Ivanovic won against Urszula Radwańska in straight sets and Monica Niculescu after hard fought match in three sets. Playing against Netherlands, both Ivanovic and Janković won singles matches (Ivanovic against Renée Reinhard in three sets) and they advanced to World Group II Play-offs for the second straight year.\nMiddle East Series.\nQatar Ladies Open.\nAs the world number three, Ivanovic was seeded first for the first time in her career at Qatar Ladies Open. After receiving first round bye, Ivanovic was set to play for the first time against Olga Govortsova. Being two points from victory, Ivanovic twisted left ankle and immediately after took a medical timeout. She succeeded to finish the match soon, though finishing it in tears, but due to injury alert, she decided to take a break and recover, giving a walkover to Agnieszka Radwańska in third round. In spite of the fact that she didn't earn too many points after Doha, Ivanovic set new career-high ranking at number two, overtaking the spot from Svetlana Kuznetsova. However, at the moment top-ranked player Justine Henin had nearly as many points as Ivanovic and Kuznetsova together.\nDubai Tennis Championships.\nDespite twisting ankle few days ago in Doha, Ivanovic looked fresh and injury-free in Dubai. After receiving bye in the first round, she lost just four games against number 14 Nicole Vaidišová, bageling in second set. However, she was given a tough task in quarterfinals, as she never won a match in previous three meetings with Elena Dementieva. Ivanovic took first set, but lost next two in quite one way, winning three games in both sets.\nIndian Wells &amp; Miami.\nPacific Life Open.\nIvanovic was once again seeded first after being first seed already in Doha. Playing her first match at Pacific Life Open against number 77 Raluca Olaru, she had to give her best to get through inspired opponent and she eventually recovered from second set loss with 6–0 in the third set, winning after nearly two hours. Though her next opponent was 31st seed, Tathiana Garbin, Ivanovic had better time on court now, as she lost three games in first set and bageled for the fifth time in a season in second set. In round of 16 another Italian, Francesca Schiavone, awaited. Thirteenth seed Schiavone started better, cruising through first set losing just two games. However, after managing to win the second set 7–5, she cruised herself through the third set, losing two games. In the quarterfinals, she faced one spot better ranked player, Vera Zvonareva, at number 21. But Ivanovic showed that ranking is not the most important thing that matters, as she beat her a lot easier, losing just five games to reach first semifinal in Indian Wells, enhancing previous best result of quarterfinals. Facing top 10 opponent for the fifth time in a season and world number 4 in Jelena Janković, Ivanovic won in straight sets to reach first final of Indian Wells Masters. Ivanovic improved head-to-head record to 5−1 against Janković. In the final she played against Svetlana Kuznetsova, the final contested of first and second seed. Ivanovic won 6–4, 6–3 to win third Tier I title, the biggest after Grand Slam. This was her first title of 2008. Also, as Indian Wells is called \"The fifth Grand Slam\", and as Ivanovic didn't won any Grand Slam at the moment, this was her biggest title at that moment. She also improved to convincing head-to-head with Kuznetsova, the same as with Janković, 5−1.\nSony Ericsson Open.\nComing to Miami Open with Indian Wells title, Ivaonovic looked confidently from the first match on, as she cruised against Émilie Loit to reach third round, losing just three games. But however, in the next round it looked like fatigue caught up with her, and she lost easily in straight sets, but to former number one Lindsay Davenport.\nClay court season and French Open.\nFed Cup.\nIvanovic once again participated in Fed Cup this year, playing in Fed Cup World Group II Play-offs, in duel of Serbia and Croatia on harcourt indoors, played in Zagreb, Croatia. Despite the event was played on hardcourt, it was a preparation for Ivanovic's clay season which started just few days later. She helped Serbia cruise to massive 3–0 lead which already secured them a spot in 2009 Fed Cup World Group II, the first time that Serbia reached that stage at Fed Cup under its name, but as Yugoslavia, they reached World Group semifinal in 1984. Croatia won next two dead rubbers though, meaning that final score was 3–2 for Serbia.\nQatar Telecom German Open.\nIvanovic started clay season returning to Berlin as the defending champion. After receiving bye in first round, she played against lucky luser Akgul Amanmuradova and won after tight first set which saw them playing tiebreak that Ivanovic won 7–0 and cruising then through the second set. She beat Sybille Bammer 7–5, 4–6, 6–4 to reach quarterfinals, and tenth seed Ágnes Szávay 3–6, 6–4, 6–3 to go two steps from defending title for the first time. However, she was stopped in semifinals when she lost 2–6, 5–7 to Elena Dementieva, losing to her for the second time in the season and fourth overall.\nInternazionali BNL d'Italia.\nFollowing withdraws of the two best players in the world, Justine Henin and Maria Sharapova, Ivanovic was seeded first in Rome. She lost already in second round and in her opening match to qualifier Tsvetana Pironkova in three sets, 4–6, 7–5, 2–6.\nFrench Open.\nIvanovic came to French Open as last year runner-up and as a second contender for the title, after renewed world No. 1 Maria Sharapova, who took that place from Justine Henin who suddenly retired from tennis in less than a fortnight before Roland Garros started. The fact that three-time defending champion at French Open Henin, and four-time champion overall didn't compete, left the draw wide open and gave chances to many players, as the only other former champion was Serena Williams.\nAs Sharapova was first seed, and Ivanovic second, they were set in line for the final clash, which would have been rematch of the Australian Open final that year. However, chances for that were blown when Maria lost in fourth round to thirteenth seed Dinara Safina. On the other side, Ivanovic brushed aside all opponents to reach third French Open quarterfinal in four years. She won against Sofia Arvidsson 6–2, 7–5, Lucie Šafářová 6–1, 6–2, 30th seed Caroline Wozniacki 6–4, 6–1, and Petra Cetkovská 6–0, 6–0, respectively. Double bagel against Cetkovská was Ivanovic's fifth career double bagel win. In quarterfinals Ivanovic beat 10th seed Patty Schnyder 6–3, 6–2. Then she was set to play against fellow Serbian player and No. 3 Jelena Janković. The most significant match between the pair took place in this semi-final of the French Open, with the winner having assured of becoming World No. 1 and with both women bidding to win their first Grand Slam title. Ivanovic won the match, recovering from a 3–1 final set deficit and also 4–3 deficit when Janković broke, to defeat Janković for the fifth consecutive time, with final score of 6–4, 3–6, 6–4. In doing so, Ivanovic reached second straight French Open final and third Slam final overall.\nDinara Safina, who beat Sharapova and another two Russians Elena Dementieva and Svetlana Kuznetsova, awaited in the final. Ivanovic build big lead from first moment on, leading 4–1 with two breaks. From that moment, she lost that first momentum, losing both breaks to fell on 4–4 egal. However, she was lucky to not fell even more, breaking again to serve for set, which she did for 6–4. She showed even stronger performance in second set, and lifted first Grand Slam trophy after one-sided win of 6–4, 6–3. Ivanovic became the 17th world No. 1 in history of WTA rankings. Also, she is one of the few players of newer generation to win Major title with that few years, at 20 years and 214 days. \nWimbledon.\nIvanovic skipped all events in preparation for Wimbledon, where she was seeded first for the first time at Grand Slam. It didn't look to bother her as she cruised through first round, losing just three games against No. 103 Rossana de los Ríos. Playing against just six spots better ranked player, she had much tougher time on court, coming back from brink of defeat by saving match points to win against Nathalie Dechy, 6–7, 7–6, 10–8.\nShe fell in third round to wildcard No. 133 Jie Zheng, 1–6, 4–6. Ivanovic played very bad match, winning just 46% of her first serve points and total of just 51% of all points on serve, converting just one break point on seven chances and making 17 unforced errors to Zheng's 10. Her exit in the third round was earliest for the top seed since 2001, when Martina Hingis lost to Virginia Ruano Pascual in first round. Ivanovic, though, ended up to be just one of the five players of the top 8 to fall before the quarterfinals, the round they were all projected to get through as of their rankings. Also, on the men's side was even worse situation as only first two seeds reached quarterfinals, though they eventually reached the final.\nUS Open Series.\nEast West Bank Classic – withdrew.\nIvanovic was set to return to action in Los Angeles, but however, she withdrew due to a thumb injury sustained during practice the week before.\nRogers Cup.\nFirst tournament she played eventually within US Open Series was the only Tier I tournament of the American summer swing in Montreal. Ivanovic was again first seed as the newest world No. 1 and the first opponent in the second round after receiving a bye in first was Petra Kvitová. Kvitová, future multiple Grand Slam champion but now just a teenager, won the second set to equalise result but however, Ivanovic got through in three tough sets. In the third round she lost to a player near outside the top 100 at 94, Tamira Paszek, with 2–6, 6–1, 2–6 scoreline.\nSummer Olympics – withdrew.\nIvanovic was seeded first at Summer Olympics. This was about to be her first appearance at the Olympics. She was even scheduled to play at the time of the release of the draw, but she eventually withdrew again due to a thumb injury sustained two weeks before, the same reason she withdrew from East West Bank Classic tournament in Los Angeles. Ivanovic described these moments as \"one of the worst moments of her career.\" As of the last year's calendar, points from previous year's Los Angeles tournament which was in this time of the year were deleted, and as she didn't participate this year in Los Angeles nor gained enough points in Montreal, she fell from the No. 1 spot for the first time after just 9 consecutive weeks. New world No. 1 was another Serbian Jelena Janković.\nUS Open.\nThough missing nearly all US Open series season, playing just one tournament in preparation for US Open, Ivanovic returned again to No. 1 spot after Olympics, as Janković lost points from last year's Rogers Cup which was at the time of this year's Olympics, leaving Janković with just one week at No. 1 spot. With playing just that one tournament in Montreal, this was Ivanovic's third tournament in Grand Slam category of all last four tournaments she played. Hard times since dream run at French Open continued for Ivanovic, as she had to battle in three sets already in first round of US Open, winning 6–1, 4–6, 6–4 against Vera Dushevina. But another early exit followed by as she lost to unheralded qualifier and No. 188 Julie Coin, losing with 3–6, 6–4, 3–6 final score. The loss was the earliest defeat of the top-seeded player at the US Open since the 1973 tournament, when Billie Jean King lost in third round. Ivanovic also surpassed her negative record in terms of Lowest-ranked players to defeat world No. 1. First, she lost to No. 133 Jie Zheng at Wimbledon Championships, and now to No. 188 Julie Coin at US Open. However, one year later Dinara Safina \"dethroned\" her from that place, losing to No. 226 Shuai Zhang.\nAfter US Open, when new rankings were released, Ivanovic finished her stay at the top spot, as US Open champion Serena Williams reached that spot for the first time since 2003. Ivanovic stayed for a total of 12 weeks at the top spot, with one week pause during the Olympic Games. Ivanovic fell to No. 3.\nAsian hard court swing.\nToray Pan Pacific Open.\nIvanovic started Asian swing in Tokyo, Tier I tournament, where she was last year's runner-up. She lost to #20 Nadia Petrova 1–6, 6–1, 2–6 in the second round. With the loss, she was then at 4–4 win-loss record since winning French Open. Ivanovic later told the press that she was \"just happy to be back injury-free\" and that she needed to \"play more matches to get back into rhythm.\"\nChina Open.\nGoing to Beijing, China, for the first time ever and where she missed Olympic Games previously this year, Ivanovic came in one place lower ranked than previous week at No. 4. She played evidently the best match since lifting French Open title as she cruised against #19 Alizé Cornet who has had a great season, winning 6–1, 7–6. Despite good overture, she lost once again to Jie Zheng, the same player who beat her at Wimbledon. However, as she won just five games at Wimbledon against her, she showed this time a step forward in that way, being now very close to beat her, but eventually losing 6–7, 6–2, 4–6. Ivanovic won even more points.\nIndoors and year-end Championships.\nKremlin Cup.\nWeek after week, and Ivanovic is slipping more and more on WTA rankings. Coming to US Open as #1, Ivanovic fell to No. 3 next week, next No.4 and now she falls to No. 5. Results unfortunately for her confirm that, and now she fell again in her first match against Dominika Cibulková in three sets at Kremlin Cup in Moscow. Ivanovic extended now her bad streak since winning French Open to a negative one for the first time, with 5–6 win-loss record since then.\nZurich Open.\nDespite losing straightaway in Moscow, Ivanovic came back to No. 4. And after series of bad results, she finally won back-to-back matches in Zurich – after receiving bye in first round, she won easily against #16 Marion Bartoli and promising Petra Kvitová whom she beat earlier in Montreal but in three sets. She lost a total of 11 games in that two matches. She lost in semifinals to top 10 opponent Venus Williams after winning first set, but showed a big step forward after series of bad results.\nGenerali Ladies Linz.\nIvanovic chose not to defend Luxembourg title, which turned out to be great as she followed good run in Zurich with even better in Linz by winning first title since French Open. On the way to the title, she beat first Sybille Bammer and seventh seed Flavia Pennetta, both in straight sets. Ana described match with Flavia as \"one of the best matches she's played recently\". She followed that with two respective wins over top 10 opponents – #10 Agnieszka Radwańska with hard fought 6–2, 3–6, 7–5 win, and routing win over #9 Vera Zvonareva, 6–2, 6–1 to win the title. She sealed an impressive win in just 51 minutes.\nWTA Tour Championships.\nLast tournament of the year for Ivanovic was the most prestigious one after Majors – WTA Tour Championships, where she qualified for the second straight year. Despite coming with two back-to-back good tournaments, Ivanovic though didn't have good time in Doha Championships, as she lost to #1 Jelena Janković after winning their last four meetings, and making a surpassing loss to Vera Zvonareva whom she beat in just more than a week losing three games. She eventually withdrew before third match due to a virus.\nIvanovic finished the year ranked at No. 5, one place worse from last year.\nTournament schedule.\nSingles schedule.\nIvanovic's 2008 singles tournament schedule is as follows:\nDoubles schedule.\nIvanovic's 2008 doubles tournament schedule is as follows:\nYearly records.\nHead-to-head matchups.\n\"Ordered by percentage of wins\""

On the east edge of campus on the Palouse of the Inland Northwest, it opened for play in 2008 and is the home venue of the Cougar golf teams of the Pac-12 Conference.\nDesigned by John Harbottle III (1958–2012), its back tees (Crimson) are at ; the course rating is 75.4 with a slope rating of 140. The average elevation is approximately above sea level and it lies between Martin Stadium and the Pullman–Moscow Regional Airport.\nPalouse Ridge replaced a sub-standard nine-hole \"WSU Golf Course\" that opened in 1925, and was mostly an unimproved recreational track. It had dual tees, but measured under for par 72, with a course rating of 65.4 and a slope of 110. The first and ninth holes originally extended west to Stadium Way, now a parking lot, and later began on the east side of Bailey–Brayton Field, in the area now occupied by tennis courts. (Replacement holes were constructed on the east end of the layout, in the area now occupied by the 18th (reversed) and 9th holes.)\nLong targeted for an upgrade, the WSU course closed in 2006 and was plowed under for the $12.3 million redesign project, constructed on part of the same site and adjacent land.\nThe 18-hole Palouse Ridge course opened in 2008 on August 29, and intends to improve the school's golf teams, provide a laboratory for students in turf grass courses, and give boosters and alumni an additional reason to visit campus. The course hosted NCAA golf with Pac-12 women's championship in 2012, the NCAA men's west regional in 2013, and the Pac-12 men's championship in 2015.\nPalouse Ridge is an upgraded complement to the area's mainstay University of Idaho Golf Course, east in Moscow, which opened in 1937 and added its second nine in 1970. The city of Pullman had attempted to construct an 18-hole golf course in the early 1990s at the northwest part of the city, near the high school. After some local opposition, it was put before voters in November 1994, and failed."

The race took place on May 1, 1943, and was won by the heavy favorite, Count Fleet.\nBackground.\nColonel Matt Winn lobbied for the Kentucky Derby to be held in 1943 despite many restrictions related to the war effort. Instead, he promised to organize a \"street-car Derby\", where out-of-state patrons were not allowed to travel to Louisville, and locals had to use the street-car rather than drive to the track.\nCount Fleet was the winter-book favorite for the Derby after being named the champion two-year-old colt of 1942. In April 1943, he easily won the Wood Memorial Stakes but injured himself during the race. That injury was considered the major obstacle to his winning the Derby. His major contenders were considered to be Ocean Wave, winner of the Blue Grass Stakes, and Blue Swords, second in the Wood Memorial.\nRace Description.\nDespite the travel restrictions, a crowd of about 60,000 turned out for the Derby. A few hours before the race, Ocean Wave was scratched due to an injured leg, leaving Count Fleet as the 2-5 favorite – the shortest odds in Derby history. Count Fleet battled for the early lead with Gold Shower, then opened a two-length lead around the first turn and into the backstretch. On the far turn, Blue Swords closed to within a length before jockey Johnny Longden clucked to Count Fleet, who responded to win handily by three lengths."

There were 12 boats (108 competitors) from 12 nations, with each nation limited to a single boat in the event. The event was won by the United States, the nation's sixth consecutive and eighth overall gold medal in the men's eight; the Americans had won every time they competed (missing 1908 and 1912). Great Britain, the only other nation to have won in the event, finished second for its first medal in the event since 1928. Norway took bronze, its first medal in the men's eight since 1920.\nBackground.\nThis was the 10th appearance of the event. Rowing had been on the programme in 1896 but was cancelled due to bad weather. The men's eight has been held every time that rowing has been contested, beginning in 1900.\nThe United States was the dominant nation in the event, with the nation winning the previous five Olympic men's eight competitions (as well as the other two competitions which the United States had entered). The American squad this year came from the University of California, Berkeley. Their primary challenger was Great Britain, represented by the Thames Rowing Club, the 1948 Grand Challenge Cup winners. Italy, the two-time reigning silver medalists, had won the 1947 European Rowing Championships.\nIreland and Portugal each made their debut in the event. Canada, Great Britain, and the United States each made their eighth appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.\nCompetition format.\nThe \"eight\" event featured nine-person boats, with eight rowers and a coxswain. It was a sweep rowing event, with the rowers each having one oar (and thus each rowing on one side). \nThe venue, Henley-on-Thames, imposed certain restrictions and modifications to the format. The course could handle only three boats at a time (and this required expansion of the typical Henley course), so the six-boat final introduced in 1936 was not possible this time. The course distance was also modified; instead of either the 2000 metres distance that was standard for the Olympics or the 1 mile 550 yards (2112 metres) standard at Henley, a course that was somewhat shorter than either was used. Sources disagree on the exact distance: 1929 metres is listed by the Official Report, though other sources say 1850 metres.\nThe 1948 competition had four rounds: three main rounds (quarterfinals, semifinals, and a final) as well as a repechage after the quarterfinals.\nResults.\nQuarterfinals.\nThe first boat in each heat advanced directly to the semifinals. The other boats competed again in the repechage for the remaining spots in the semifinals.\nRepechage.\nThe winner of each race advanced to the semifinals, while the other boats were eliminated.\nSemifinals.\nThe winner of each race advanced to the final, while the other boats were eliminated."

        "text": "The 2017 U.S. Open Championship was the 117th U.S. Open, held June 15–18 at Erin Hills in Erin, Wisconsin, northwest of Milwaukee. Brooks Koepka claimed his first major title with a 16-under-par 272, four strokes ahead of runners-up Brian Harman and Hideki Matsuyama. Koepka's score matched the lowest ever at the championship, set in 2011 by Rory McIlroy.\nThis was the first U.S. Open in Wisconsin, but marked its fifth major, following four editions of the PGA Championship. The PGA was played in 1933 at Blue Mound in Wauwatosa, and at Whistling Straits near Kohler in 2004, 2010, and 2015.\nThe purse was a record for a major at $12 million, and the winner's share exceeded $2 million for the first time, at $2.16 million.\nVenue.\nThis was the first U.S. Open at Erin Hills, which opened in 2006 and hosted the U.S. Amateur in 2011. It was also the first U.S. Open since 1992 at par 72.\nIt continued a long tradition of golf in the state, which hosted the U.S. Women's Open twice at Blackwolf Run in Kohler (1998, 2012), and the U.S. Senior Open at Whistling Straits in 2007. The PGA Tour formerly stopped in the state regularly with the Greater Milwaukee Open (1968–2009), preceded by the Milwaukee Open Invitational (1955–1961).\nField.\nAbout half the field consisted of players who were exempt from qualifying for the U.S. Open.

The course played easily, yielding 44 under-par rounds. Despite this, many of the pre-tournament favorites faltered. Jordan Spieth played solidly, but stumbled late for an opening 73 (+1). World number one Dustin Johnson was derailed by a double bogey on the par-5 14th, shooting a 3-over 75. Jon Rahm, Rory McIlroy, and Jason Day were even worse, shooting 76 (+4), 78 (+6), and 79 (+7), respectively. Meanwhile, Canadian Adam Hadwin tied a U.S. Open record with six straight birdies, en route to shooting four under par. This was the first major in which neither Phil Mickelson or Tiger Woods competed, in 23 years. The scoring average was 73.385 (+1.385).\nSecond round.\n\"Friday, June 16, 2017\"\nFour players finished atop the leadership after the second round for the first time since 1974. Paul Casey was four-over on his round before recording five straight birdies from holes 17-3 to shoot 71 (−1). Brooks Koepka made four birdies on his front-nine to get to nine-under but fell back with two bogeys on the back-nine. They were joined at the top of the leaderboard by Tommy Fleetwood and Brian Harman, who each shot 70 (−2). First round leader Rickie Fowler also got as low as nine-under before three straight bogeys saw him fall a shot behind the leaders. Hideki Matsuyama and Chez Reavie had the low round of the day with a 65 (−7); combined with Fowler's opening round, it is the first time in U.S. Open history that three players shot a round of 65 in the same tournament. Forty-two players were under-par after 36 holes, a new tournament record. The scoring average was 73.225 (+1.225).\nFor the first time since the introduction of the Official World Golf Ranking in 1986, the top three ranked players (Dustin Johnson, Rory McIlroy, and Jason Day) all missed the cut in a major championship.\nAmateurs: \"Champ (−5)\", \"Scheffler (−1)\", Andersen (+2), McNealy (+3), Smalley (+3), Gregory (+4), Niemann (+5), Crawford (+6), Dalke (+6), Hagestad (+8), Theegala (+8), Harvey (+10), Oda (+10), Lee (+20)\nThird round.\n\"Saturday, June 17, 2017\"\nOvernight rains and calm conditions during the day led to numerous low scores. Brian Harman birdied three holes on the back-nine to post a score of 67 (−5) and take a one-shot lead over Tommy Fleetwood, Brooks Koepka, and Justin Thomas. Thomas began the round in a tie for 24th before a historic round put him into contention. An eagle on the 18th gave Thomas a score of 63 (−9), tying the major championship record. At nine-under, he set the U.S. Open record for lowest score in relation to par, breaking the mark set by Johnny Miller in 1973. Fleetwood held possession of the lead before a bogey at the par-5 18th saw him finish a shot behind Harman, while Koepka birdied the last to also get to within a stroke. Rickie Fowler recovered from a bogey at the 13th with three straight birdies on holes 14-16 and was two back. Paul Casey began the round tied for the lead but shot a three-over 75 and dropped to 17th.\nFive golfers were at 10-under-par or better entering the final round. Before this year, only six golfers had ever reached double digits under par at any point in a U.S. Open. The scoring average was 72.036 (+0.036).\nAmateurs: Champ (−4), Scheffler (−2)\nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, June 18, 2017\"\nSummary.\nBrooks Koepka tied the U.S. Open scoring record and won his first career major championship by four strokes over Brian Harman and Hideki Matsuyama. Beginning the round a shot out of the lead, Koepka quickly erased the deficit with birdies on his first two holes. After saving par with an eight-foot putt on the 13th, he then recorded three straight birdies on his way to a round of 67 (−5). His total of 16-under par tied the tournament scoring record set by Rory McIlroy in 2011. Harman entered the round with the lead but fell into a tie for second with three bogeys on the back-nine. Matsuyama shot the low round of the day with 66 (−6) and jumped into a tie with Harman. After establishing a new tournament scoring record in the third round, Justin Thomas bogeyed three of his first five holes and finished three-over on the round to drop to a tie for ninth. Tommy Fleetwood also began the round a shot behind but three bogeys on the front-nine dropped him from contention. The low amateur was Scottie Scheffler, who finished at –1, beating Cameron Champ by just one stroke. In all, thirty-one players finished the tournament under par, breaking the U.S. Open record set in 1990.\nScorecard.\n\"Final round\"\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\""

        "text": "The 2017 Stanley Cup Finals was the championship series of the National Hockey League's (NHL) 2016–17 season, and the culmination of the 2017 Stanley Cup playoffs. The Eastern Conference champion and defending Stanley Cup champion Pittsburgh Penguins defeated the Western Conference champion Nashville Predators, four games to two. Penguins captain Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as the most valuable player of the playoffs for the second consecutive year. The Penguins won the Stanley Cup in their opponent's rink for the fifth time.\nDuring the regular season, the Penguins finished second in the league with 111 points, which gave them home ice advantage in the series. The series began on May 29 and concluded on June 11. The Penguins made their second consecutive Finals appearance, marking the third time in their history they had done this, following their appearances in – and –. This was the first time since 2009, a rematch between the Penguins and Detroit Red Wings, that any team appeared in consecutive Finals. The Penguins also became the first team since the Red Wings (in and ) to win the Stanley Cup in consecutive years and the first to do so since the introduction of the salary cap. They also became the fifth franchise to accomplish this feat more than once.\nThis marked the second consecutive season in which a Western Conference team made their first appearance in the Finals; the San Jose Sharks made their Finals debut the year prior. This was the first time in NHL history that two United States–born head coaches faced off against each other in the Stanley Cup Finals.\nThe Penguins won the first two games of the series despite being massively outshot by the Predators in both games. Nashville tied the series at two with a pair of convincing wins at home. However, Penguins goaltender Matt Murray shut out the Predators for the remainder of the series. Penguins coach Mike Sullivan became the third coach in NHL history to win the Stanley Cup in his first two seasons as a coach with his team, joining Pete Green of the original Ottawa Senators (in and ) and Toe Blake of the Montreal Canadiens (in and ). This was the first Finals since in which no game was decided by one goal, and the second Finals in three years to have none of its games reach overtime.\nPaths to the Finals.\nPittsburgh Penguins.\nThis was Pittsburgh's second consecutive Finals appearance, and sixth overall. The Penguins did not make any major transactions during the offseason, instead of signing head coach Mike Sullivan to a three-year extension. At the deadline, Pittsburgh acquired defensemen Ron Hainsey and Mark Streit via trade, which proved helpful for depth when star Kris Letang suffered a season-ending injury just weeks before the playoffs started.\nPittsburgh finished with 111 points (50–21–11) during the regular season to finish second in the Metropolitan Division and second overall among playoff teams. Center and team captain Sidney Crosby led the Penguins with 89 points, which ranked second in the league, and won the Rocket Richard Trophy with 44 goals. Phil Kessel led the team in assists with 47.\nIn the playoffs, the Penguins defeated the Columbus Blue Jackets in five games, eliminated the Presidents' Trophy-winning Washington Capitals for a second consecutive year, this time in seven games, and edged the Ottawa Senators in seven games in the Eastern NHL Conference Finals after Chris Kunitz scored in double overtime of game seven.\nNashville Predators.\nThis was Nashville's first Stanley Cup Finals appearance in its 19-year history.\nDuring the offseason, Nashville traded defenceman and long-time team captain Shea Weber to Montreal for defenceman P. K. Subban, and during the regular season, traded for forwards Cody McLeod and Vernon Fiddler. The Predators also re-signed forward Filip Forsberg during the offseason.\nNashville finished with 94 points (41–29–12) during the regular season to finish as the second wild-card team in the Western Conference, and the 16th overall and last-seeded playoff team. Forsberg and Viktor Arvidsson tied for the team lead in regular-season goal-scoring with 31 each. Ryan Johansen led the team in assists with 47. Arvidsson and Johansen tied for the team lead in points with 61.\nThe Predators started the playoffs by upsetting the top-seeded Chicago Blackhawks in four games, becoming the second team in NHL history to be the lowest seed in their conference to sweep the top seeded team in the opening round (1993 St. Louis Blues). They followed that up by eliminating the St. Louis Blues and Anaheim Ducks, both in six games. Kevin Fiala and Johansen sustained serious leg injuries in the second and third rounds respectively, and both missed the remainder of the playoffs. The Predators became the third team to be the lowest seed in their conference in NHL history to reach the Stanley Cup Finals, joining the 2006 Edmonton Oilers and the 2012 Los Angeles Kings. The Predators were also the third different franchise that head coach Peter Laviolette led to the Stanley Cup Finals. He won the Cup with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006, and also took the Philadelphia Flyers to the 2010 Stanley Cup Finals.\nGame summaries.\nGame one.\nLate in the first period, penalties from Nashville forwards Calle Jarnkrok and James Neal gave Pittsburgh a full two-minute 5-on-3 power play, and Evgeni Malkin scored to make it 1–0. Just 1:15 later, Conor Sheary scored into an open net after a cross-ice pass from Chris Kunitz caught Nashville's defence off guard. In the final seconds of the period, a centring pass from Nick Bonino deflected off Mattias Ekholm and into the net to give Pittsburgh a 3–0 lead. Following Bonino's goal, the Penguins went 37 consecutive minutes without a shot on goal, including the entire second period. The Predators used power-play goals from Ryan Ellis and Colton Sissons to make it 3–2, and Frederick Gaudreau scored immediately following a Penguins power play to tie the game midway through the third. Soon afterwards, Pittsburgh's first shot since the first period resulted in a Jake Guentzel goal to give Pittsburgh the lead again. Bonino scored again into an empty net to clinch the victory for Pittsburgh.\nGame two.\nMidway through the first, the Predators took their first-ever lead in a Stanley Cup Finals game when Pontus Aberg scored around Olli Maatta. The Penguins tied it late in the period when a Guentzel tip sneaked past Pekka Rinne. After a scoreless second period in which the Predators took twice as many shots as the Penguins, Pittsburgh came out firing in the third, scoring three goals in 3:18. The first was Guentzel's twelfth of the playoffs, making him the first rookie since Dino Ciccarelli to score twelve times in a single postseason. The next two goals came 15 seconds apart and prompted Predators head coach Peter Laviolette to replace Rinne with backup Juuse Saros. Nashville never cut into the deficit as Pittsburgh won the game by 4–1.\nGame three.\nJake Guentzel came within one goal of Dino Ciccarelli's rookie playoff record when a shot 2:46 into the game got past Pekka Rinne. In the second period, Roman Josi and Frederick Gaudreau scored only 42 seconds apart to quickly give Nashville the lead. Neal scored with 23 seconds left in the second to give the Predators a two-goal lead. In the third period, a breakaway by Craig Smith and a goal by Ekholm provided insurance in a 5–1 victory for Nashville. Near the end of the game, several misconducts were assessed after a cross checking by Phil Kessel drew a crowd and fights broke out.\nGame four.\nCalle Jarnkrok gave Nashville an early lead, but a breakaway goal by Sidney Crosby tied the score at one. In the second period, after a Penguins breakaway was stopped by Rinne, Gaudreau's wrap-around shot appeared to be stopped by Matt Murray, but video review showed the puck sneak under Murray's paddle and across the goal line before Murray sent it back out. A breakaway goal by Viktor Arvidsson gave the Predators their third goal of the game. Rinne would stop all nine shots faced in the third period and an empty-net goal by Filip Forsberg gave Nashville a 4–1 win and tied the series 2–2.\nGame five.\nJustin Schultz scored for Pittsburgh early in the first period on the power play. Two more goals from the Penguins caused Nashville to again replace Rinne with Saros in net to start the second period. Pittsburgh scored three more times in the second, the first from Conor Sheary. Guentzel assisted on Sheary's goal, tying the rookie record for points in a single postseason (21). Kessel and Ron Hainsey scored the last of Pittsburgh's six goals; Kessel and Crosby both ended the game with three points. Neither team scored in the third period, making Matt Murray the first rookie since Cam Ward in 2006 to record a shutout in the Stanley Cup Finals. During the third period, 20 penalties were assessed, the most in one period since the third game of the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.\nGame six.\nThe game remained scoreless until the final two minutes of the third period when former Predator Patric Hornqvist scored with 1:35 left in the game. Nashville challenged for goaltender interference, but the on-ice ruling was upheld. Carl Hagelin added an empty net goal with 15 seconds remaining whilst the Penguins would win their second consecutive Stanley Cup becoming the first since the Red Wings did it against the Flyers and the Capitals in 1997 and 1998 respectively. Sidney Crosby was awarded the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the playoffs for the second consecutive season.\nDuring the second period, a quick whistle prevented a Predators' scoring chance that almost certainly would have resulted in a goal. Referee Kevin Pollock thought Matt Murray had covered a Filip Forsberg shot, but the puck was, in fact, loose in the goal crease, when Colton Sissons tapped it in.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 2017 Stanley Cup was presented to Penguins captain Sidney Crosby by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman following the Penguins 2–0 win over the Predators in game six\nThe following Penguins players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n2016–17 Pittsburgh Penguins\nEngraving notes.\nIncluded in the team picture, but left off of the Stanley Cup.\nTelevision and radio.\nIn Canada, the series was broadcast by Sportsnet and simulcast by CBC Television in English, and TVA Sports in French.

Despite competition from the 2017 Tony Awards broadcast and the return of ABC's Sunday-night game show block, game six achieved a total viewership of 7.086 million.\n\"The NHL on Westwood One\"/NBC Sports Radio carried the games throughout the United States on radio and through online streaming, while the home calls of Nashville (WPRT-FM/Predators Radio Network) and Pittsburgh (WXDX-FM/Penguins Radio Network) was available both over the air in their home markets and through online streaming."

        "text": "The 2016 Ironman World Championship was a long distance triathlon competition that was held on October 8, 2016 in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. It was won by Jan Frodeno of Germany and Daniela Ryf of Switzerland, both repeat champions from 2015. The race was the 40th edition of the Ironman World Championship, which has been held annually in Hawaii since 1978. The championship was organized by the World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) and awarded a total purse prize of $650,000.\nQualification.\nThe division of athletes was divided into professional, age group, physically challenged, hand cycle, and military divisions.\nProfessional.\nFor entry into the 2016 World Championship race professional triathletes qualified for the championship through a point system. Points were earned by competing in WTC sanctioned Ironman and Ironman 70.3 events throughout the qualifying year. For the 2016 championship race that period was August 30, 2015 to August 21, 2016. The top 50 male and top 35 female pros in points at the end of the qualifying year qualified to race in Kona. An athlete's five highest scoring races were counted in the point totals. At least one Ironman race must have been completed and only three Ironman 70.3 races counted towards an athlete's overall point total. Prior champions of a WTC Championship received an automatic entry for the Championship race for a period of five years after their last championship performance provided that they competed in at least one full-distance Ironman race during the qualifying year. Additionally, winners of the five regional Ironman championships received automatic qualification into the 2016 Ironman Championship. All automatic entries awarded did not count toward the number of available qualifying spots. The available prize money to professional triathletes for qualifying races ranged from $25,000 to $150,000, depending on the event.\nIn July 2015, WTC announced a pilot program for separate professional men and women only events for races in 2016. On four different dates separate races will be held with only females in the professional field and only males in the professional field, for a total of eight different events. This impacted two dates during the 2016 championship qualifying year, July 24, where the professional women raced at Ironman Lake Placid and the professional men raced Ironman Canada and August 20/21 where the women competed at Ironman Sweden and the men at Ironman Copenhagen. The program is based partly on feedback from female professionals who have stated that slower professional men (who start prior to the women) and age group men (who start after) interfere with the women's racing and tactics.\nAmateur.\nAmateur athletes could qualify through a single performance at an Ironman event. Slots were allocated to each amateur age group category, male and female, with the number of slots given out based on that category's proportional representation of the overall field. Each age group category was tentatively allocated one qualifying spot in each qualifying event.\nOther means of entry into the championship race could also be obtained through Ironman's Legacy program, or through the Ironman’s charitable eBay auction. Handcycle competitors, who are paraplegic, quadriplegic or double above-the-knee amputees and use a hand cranked cycle on the bike segment and racing chair for the run segment could also qualify at Ironman 70.3 Cairns (one male/one female), Ironman 70.3 Luxembourg (two male/one female), and Ironman 70.3 Buffalo Springs Lake (one male/one female)\nWTC offered an Executive Challenge program, named Ironman XC, that provided the chance to qualify for the championship race via other select Ironman events. Entry into the program was done through an application process.\nIn December 2014, WTC announced a newly created military division for active duty personnel. The division was open to any active personnel, regardless of country or gender. Slots were allocated in a similar fashion to the normal age group qualification process with age group categories set at 18-29, 30-39 and 40+ for each gender. Three races were announced, with two impacting the 2016 qualifying period: Ironman 70.3 Superfrog (14 slots) and Ironman Cairns (10 Slots).\nQualifying Ironman races.\nx Amateur only competition.\nm Professional men's field\nw Professional women's field"

The group consisted of four teams: Seeded team and host nation Spain, World Cup debutants Honduras, Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland.\nNorthern Ireland won the group after defeating Spain in their final group game, who also progressed to the second round in a game marred by controversy. Just a few hours after the Disgrace of Gijón, another disheartening and suspicious incident unfolded during the 1982 World Cup. This time, it involved the match between Northern Ireland and Spain, which, much like the West Germany versus Austria match, held pivotal importance in Group 5. The game took place on the same day, June 25, 1982, at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia, Spain. Similar to the situation in Gijón, both teams were aware that they would secure advancement to the knockout stages if Northern Ireland won by a single goal. The decisive goal of the match came in the 47th minute when Gerry Armstrong scored for Northern Ireland. Following this, the tempo of the game dropped significantly, with neither side making any substantial attempts to score. The rest of encounter was defined by a conspicuous absence of attacking zeal and an overall sense of lethargy, persisting even after Mal Donaghy received his marching orders for Northern Ireland. Remarkably, the dismissal, transpiring with over thirty minutes remaining, failed to ignite any fervent response from Spain, as they refrained from pushing forward in pursuit of a goal. This event brought attention to the shortcomings of the group stage format, prompting questions about the integrity of the competition. It also sparked calls for FIFA to reconsider the rules of the World Cup, aiming to make it more challenging for teams to engage in collusion.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nSpain vs Yugoslavia.\nThis was the fourth time that Yugoslavia lost for the host nation of tournament, after Uruguay in 1930, Chile in 1962 and West Germany in 1974."

However, none of them won the race. It is considered by many to be the greatest Derby field of all time.\nOne of the most infamous moments in Derby history also occurred during the 1957 stretch run. Bill Shoemaker, aboard Gallant Man, misjudged the finish, mistaking the 16th pole for the wire. He stood in his saddle for just a second, but it was enough to ruin Gallant Man's momentum and allow Iron Liege to rally up the inside and beat Gallant Man by a nose.\nGallant Man won the Belmont Stakes a few weeks later. Fourth place finisher Bold Ruler won the Preakness Stakes and was the sire of the great Secretariat."

It was the first basketball video game with a trackball for player movement and the first to use the angled side view which became a commonly used perspective in the basketball video games that followed.\nGameplay.\n\"Basketball\" supports one and two player modes and uses a trackball to control each player's movement. At the start of each game, the song \"Sweet Georgia Brown\" is played. Players must first gain possession of the ball and move towards their opponent's goal. When in position for a shot, the pushbutton is held until the player's arm is at a suitable height and the button is released. Shots can be blocked by an opponent, and, when dribbling, an opponent can steal the ball. The winner is the player with the highest score when the clock runs out.\nReception.\nCashbox magazine praised the game for its fast action and realistic animated player characters. \"Basketball\" appeared in the top 10 video arcade games rankings for several months in 1979 according to Play Meter magazine."

        "title": "La Liga play-offs",
        "text": "The La Liga play-offs are an annual series of football matches to determine the final promotion places within Segunda División and La Liga. In its current format, it involves the four teams that finish directly below the automatic promotion places from Segunda División to the top tier. These teams meet in a series of play-off matches to determine the final team that will be promoted. Reserve teams are not eligible for promotion.\nThe play-offs were first introduced in 1929 and have been staged at the conclusion of every season since, except between 2000 and 2010. Until 1999, it consisted in games between teams from both leagues, but when it was reinstated, it only involved four teams from Segunda División.\nResults.\n1929.\nThe first edition of La Liga and Segunda División finished with a promotion/relegation playoff between the champion of Segunda División and the last qualified team of La Liga. It was played with a double-leg format and Racing Santander remained in the top tier.\n1935–1936.\nIn 1934, the Segunda División was expanded into three groups of 10 teams. The two first qualified teams of each group would play a final stage with a round-robin format. The two top teams, promoted to La Liga.\n1940–1950.\nJust after the Spanish Civil War, the 1939–40 Segunda División was expanded into five groups where the winners joined the final stage. The champion promoted directly while the runner-up played a single-game to promote to La Liga.\nIn the next season, the Segunda División was reduced to two groups of 12 teams where the two top teams joined a final group. In this one, the winner and the runner-up promoted directly while the 3rd and 4th qualified played against the two last qualified teams in La Liga. The two winners achieved the spot for the top tier's next season. From 1945 (one year after the reduction of Segunda División to one only group) to 1947, there was only one promotion/relegation game.\nAll games were played in a neutral venue.\n1951–1956.\nFor the leagues of the 1950s, when the Segunda División was divided into two groups, a new promotion/relegation system was created. The second and third qualified of each group and the 13th and 14th of La Liga, played by 16 teams, joined a round-robin group where the two top teams would promote to the next La Liga season.\n1959–1968.\nIn 1958 the RFEF re-adopted the promotion/relegation play-offs system between teams from La Liga and Segunda División. Teams qualified in positions 13 and 14 of La Liga would face against the 3rd and 4th qualified in Segunda División. The two winners achieved the spot for the top tier's next season.\n1987–1999.\nIn 1987 the LFP, with the expansion of La Liga to 20 teams, re-adopted the promotion/relegation play-offs between teams from La Liga and Segunda División. This time, the 17th and 18th qualified teams in La Liga would face the 3rd and 4th position teams of Segunda División, excluding reserve teams. The two winners of the double-legged play-offs would get a place in the next La Liga season. This format worked until 1999, when the LFP removed it and determined that three teams will directly promote or relegate.\nIn 1997, for reducing the number of teams in La Liga from 22 to 20, there was only one play-off game between the 18th qualified in La Liga and the third one of Segunda.\nIn gold, teams from La Liga and in silver, teams from Segunda División.\n2011–present.\nFor the 2010–11 season, the Segunda División adopted the Football League play-offs format. While the two first qualified teams were directly promoted to La Liga's next season, teams qualified between third and sixth would take part in the play-offs. If a reserve team qualifies in one of these positions, its spot will be transferred to the next best qualified.\nFifth placed faces against the fourth, while the sixth positioned team faces against the third. The final is also two-legged. The best positioned team always plays at home on the second leg.\nSince the second edition, a new rule was established: in case of a tied eliminatory there were extra time, once finished it, this season introduced that there would not be penalty shoot-out and the winner would be the best positioned team."

The competition took place between 21 September 2016 and 22 January 2017, over a total of nine events. The defending champions were Wout van Aert in the men's competition and Sanne Cant in the women's competition.\nVan Aert was able to defend his World Cup title with a round to spare, not finishing any lower than second in the seven races – four wins and three second-place finishes – prior to his crowning. His main rival Mathieu van der Poel was the only other rider to take victories prior to the title being won, taking three straight wins during the season, but he missed several meetings, including the Memorial Romano Scotti in Rome, which allowed van Aert to take the title.\nWith six different winners in as many races, the women's competition proved competitive. After a win at CrossVegas, Dutch rider Sophie de Boer held the leaders' jersey and despite Katie Compton taking the jersey after the following round at the Jingle Cross, de Boer was able to regain the jersey with consistent finishing. Over the next five races – despite not winning any races – de Boer achieved finishes of second, fourth, third and sixth, and with Cant missing the round in Rome, another third-place finish gave de Boer her first Cyclo-cross World Cup title.\nPoints distribution.\nPoints were awarded to all eligible riders each race. The top ten finishers received points according to the following table:\nRiders finishing in positions 11 to 50 also received points, going down from 40 points for 11th place by one point per place to 1 point for 50th place.\nEvents.\nIn comparison to last season's seven races, this season was scheduled to have nine. Lignières-en-Berry was taken out of the programme – while Rome (Fiuggi), Iowa and Zeven were added."

A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places in the knockout phase of the 2016–17 UEFA Champions League.\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 25 August 2016, 18:00 CEST, at the Grimaldi Forum in Monaco. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, with the restriction that teams from the same association could not be drawn against each other. For the draw, the teams were seeded into four pots based on the following principles:\nMoreover, the draw was controlled for teams from the same association in order to split the teams evenly into the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) for maximum television coverage.\nThe fixtures were decided after the draw. On each matchday, four groups play their matches on Tuesday, while the other four groups play their matches on Wednesday, with the two sets of groups (A–D, E–H) alternating between each matchday. There are other restrictions: for example, teams from the same city (e.g., Real Madrid and Atlético Madrid) in general do not play at home on the same matchday (UEFA tries to avoid teams from the same city playing at home on the same day or on consecutive days, due to logistics and crowd control), and teams in certain countries (e.g., Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan) do not play at home on the last matchday (due to cold weather and simultaneous kick-off times).\nOn 17 July 2014, the UEFA emergency panel ruled that Ukrainian and Russian clubs would not be drawn against each other \"until further notice\" due to the political unrest between the countries. Therefore, Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv (Pot 3) and Russian clubs CSKA Moscow (Pot 1) and Rostov (Pot 4) could not be drawn into the same group.\nTeams.\nBelow are the participating teams (with their 2016 UEFA club coefficients), grouped by their seeding pot. They included 22 teams which entered in this stage, and the 10 winners of the play-off round (5 in Champions Route, 5 in League Route).\nFormat.\nIn each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the round of 16, while the third-placed teams entered the Europa League round of 32.\nTiebreakers.\nThe teams were ranked according to points (3 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). If two or more teams were equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria were applied in the order given to determine the rankings (regulations Article 17.01):\nGroups.\nThe matchdays were 13–14 September, 27–28 September, 18–19 October, 1–2 November, 22–23 November, and 6–7 December 2016. The match kickoff times are 20:45 CEST/CET, except for matchday 5 in Russia which are 18:00 CET. The match kickoff times for matchdays 4 and 5 in Turkey were changed from 20:45 CET to 18:45 CET due to the decision of the Turkish government to use the time zone all year round starting from September 2016.\nTimes are CET/CEST, as listed by UEFA (local times are in parentheses).\nGroup A.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup B.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup C.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup D.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup E.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup F.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup G.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nGroup H.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;"

        "text": "The 2016–17 UConn Huskies women's basketball team represents University of Connecticut (UConn) during the 2016–17 NCAA Division I women's basketball season. The Huskies, led by Hall of Fame head coach Geno Auriemma, in his 32nd season at UConn, will play their home games at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion and the XL Center and were fourth year members of the American Athletic Conference. They finished the season 36–1, 16–0 in AAC play to win both the AAC regular season and tournament titles to earn an automatic trip to the NCAA women's tournament where they defeated Albany and Syracuse in the first and second rounds, UCLA in the sweet sixteen and Oregon in the elite eight to reach their eighteenth final four where they lost on a game winning buzzer beater in overtime to Mississippi State ending a 111-game winning streak.\nMedia.\nEvery single Connecticut game is expected to be televised. Excluding exhibitions, most Connecticut games air on SNY, an ESPN network, or a CBS network. Exhibition games and games that air on SNY are also streamed on Husky Vision. Every game is expected to be broadcast on the UConn IMG Sports Network with an extra audio broadcast being available online to listen to through Husky Vision.\nGames.\nExhibition.\nIUP.\nConnecticut took on the Division II Indiana University of Pennsylvania Crimson Hawks in their initial exhibition game. The Huskies started strong early, opening up a 13–2 lead in the opening minutes. The Crimson Hawks played roughly even over the next few minutes; the Huskies were leading 26–14 late in the first quarter. An 8–0 run to start the second quarter and a 14–0 run to start the second half helped extend the lead and Connecticut ended up with the win, 111–39. Katie Lou Samuelson was the leading scorer with 24 points for UConn while Carolyn Appleby was the leading scorer for IUP with 17 points.\nPace.\nThe second, and final exhibition game of the season was against the Pace University Setters. The Huskies worked on their full-court press, which was effective against the Division II team, holding Pace to just three points in the first quarter against 35 for the Huskies. Connecticut continued the full-court pressure in the second quarter and led 59–9 at the half. In the third quarter, Connecticut stopped the press and let the Setters play in a half-court offense; Pace kept pace with Connecticut; each team scoring 13 in the third quarter. The final score, in favor of the Huskies 95–32. Pace's Kirsten Dodge was high scorer for the team with nine points. UConn's Gabby Williams had a double double scoring 24 points and securing 10 rebounds.\nRegular season.\nFlorida State (away).\nThe opening of the regular-season was a road game against Florida State University. The Seminoles were ranked 12th, but did not have Leticia Romero, who had played on the Olympic team from Spain which won the silver medal. The Huskies brought a 75-game winning streak into the game, although several key players from those teams had graduated. Florida State led by four points at halftime, only the fourth time that Connecticut trailed at the half in their streak. The Seminoles expanded the lead to seven; the largest deficit the Huskies had faced in the second half of the streak was two points, against Maryland the previous year. The Huskies had not had a player foul out the entire previous year but had two players with three fouls each by halftime, Katie Lou Samuelson and Gabby Williams. In the second half, Gabby Williams hit a three pointer, the first one of her career and Samuelson hit another three-pointer as part of a 14–2 run to give a five-point lead to UConn. The Huskies would extend the margin to eight points, but the Seminoles responded and cut the lead to a single point with under a minute to go. Brittany Brown was fouled attempting a three-pointer and went to the line with a three-point deficit, making two of three to cut the lead to a single point. She missed the third free-throw, which was knocked out of bounds by two players, one from each team. The referees called it Florida State's ball, and affirmed the call after a review. After inbounding, Shakayla Thomas tried to score but she was blocked by Naphessa Collier who then tapped the ball to Crystal Dangerfield. Florida State had one final chance, down by two points, but Imani Wright's three-point attempt missed the basket and Connecticut escaped with a two-point win, 78–76. Napheesa Collier had a career-high 28 points, while Saniya Chong added 16 points, 12 of which came in the fourth quarter.\nBaylor (home).\nConnecticut played Baylor in the first home game of the season. Baylor's AP ranking is #2 while Connecticut is #3. It is the first time since February 2015, when Connecticut faced South Carolina, that the Huskies were playing a team ranked ahead of them in a poll. Prior to the tip off, Connecticut unveiled the banner identifying the team as the 2016 NCAA champions. The Lady Bears scored twice before the Huskies first score. UConn responded and took a lead, but the lead changed hands repeatedly as the score remained close throughout the first half. Baylor missed a three-pointer near the end of the half, allowing UConn to go into halftime with a three-point lead 32–29. Baylor opened the second half with a seven-point run to take the lead. However, shortly after, the Huskies led by Chrystal Dangerfield and Gabby Williams went on an 18–4 run to give UConn a 10-point lead. The Lady Bears responded and tied the game at 54 with about minutes remaining in the game. UConn then went on a 16–2 run to make the score 70–56 with about a minute left in the game. The game ended with UConn leading 72–61. The win extended the UConn winning streak to 77 consecutive games, the second longest streak in women's basketball history, behind only by UConn's 90 consecutive wins. Baylor's Alexis Jones had 23 points while UConn's Dangerfield came off the bench to score 19 points.\nLSU (away).\nUConn visited Baton Rouge for a game against LSU. The Lady Tigers kept the game close early, trailing by only 16–14. The Huskies opened up the game in the second quarter, hitting three consecutive three-pointers to extend the lead to 13 points. The Lady Tigers played roughly even in the second half, but the final score favored Connecticut 76–53. The final margin of 23 points was exactly half of the margin in the prior year's meeting in Connecticut where the Huskies won by 46 points. Katie Lou Samuelson was the leading scorer for the Huskies with 28 points on seven three-pointers.\nDayton (home).\nConnecticut took on Dayton at home, the third time in history the two teams have met. The Huskies won both prior games, including the most recent game played in the Elite Eight game of the 2015 NCAA tournament. In that game, Dayton led at halftime, one of only three times in the last 127 games that UConn has trailed at halftime. The fans may have been thinking back to that game when Dayton was leading 10–5 just over four minutes into the game. Those thoughts dissipated when the Huskies scored the next 15 points. Connecticut expanded the lead until it reached a 20-point margin at halftime. The two teams played roughly even in the third quarter, but three-pointers by Nurse and Samuelson opened the fourth quarter to start another 15–0 run. When the final buzzer sounded, Connecticut won 98–65. Samuelson, who had set her career high with 28 points in the prior game, set a new career-high with 29 points. Williams had a double-double with 19 points and 11 rebounds, while Collier scored 22 points.\nChattanooga (home).\nUConn played Chattanooga in the first regular-season game in Hartford. The Mocs led 5–0 and still led 14-13 late in the first quarter when Gabby Williams stole the ball and made a layup to put the Huskies ahead. UConn led by just 12 points at halftime, but after giving up the first basket of the second half, they scored 18 consecutive points. The Huskies won 80–43 giving them 80 consecutive wins. When asked about the 5 ranked teams in the upcoming schedule, Auriemma said \"...we need to get our ass beat and soon and bad, so that some of our guys will come to realize that this is not as easy as they think it is\".\nDePaul (home).\nConnecticut hosted 15th ranked DePaul at their campus arena. The Huskies hit their first nine shots, but it was the defense that impressed coach Auriemma as the team held the Blue Demons without a basket for almost 6 minutes. The score was 22–1 before the Blue Demons hit their first basket. Kia Nurse exceeded her best scoring output of the season in the first quarter, exceeded her prior career high in the second quarter, and ended with 33 points, a new career-high. Gabby Williams assisted on 10 baskets, a new career high. DePaul, who was leading the nation in made three-pointers, hit only seven of their 40 attempts. The Huskies had a 31-point lead at the end of the first quarter, and went on to win 91–46, recording their 81st consecutive victory.\nTexas (neutral).\nUConn faced 14th ranked Texas before a crowd of 9,014 at the Mohegan Sun Arena as part of the annual Jimmy V classic. The Longhorns dominated early, leading 10–6 at the first timeout of the quarter and 17–11 with just under two minutes to go in the quarter. Coach Auriemma thought the Texas was going to overwhelm Connecticut with their size and athletic ability. However, the Huskies responded with 11 consecutive points to take a five-point lead. They extended the lead to double digits and ended the half with a nine-point cushion. In the third quarter, Texas cut the lead to two and had a chance to tie or take the lead with the score at 51–49. After missing a shot that would have tied the game, Connecticut scored the next 12 points. Texas was unable to respond, and Connecticut came away with the win 72–54. Collier played virtually the entire game, not coming out until the final minute, scoring 24 points and pulling down eight rebounds.\nNotre Dame (away).\nThe game between Notre Dame and Connecticut featured the teams ranked first and second in the AP and Coaches poll, with UConn holding the top position in the AP and the Irish holding the top position in the Coaches poll. The game was played at Notre Dame's Purcell Pavilion before a sellout crowd.\nNotre Dame scored first, but Samuelson responded with a three-pointer to take the lead, a basket which would prove to be the only three-pointer of the game for the Huskies. That score was the first of several, as UConn opened up an 11–2 lead. Notre Dame responded, but UConn held a 23–14 lead at the end of the quarter. After UConn scored a basket to open the second quarter, the Irish scored nine consecutive points to close the gap to two points. Notre Dame added another 9–0 run to take a lead 34–30, although UConn scored the final four points of the half to tie the game at halftime. The second half also featured runs, with UConn scoring the first eight points of the second half, holding the Irish scoreless until after the media timeout, but the Irish responded with an eight-point run of their own to tie the game. However, Notre Dame would only score one more point in the quarter. Connecticut held a seven-point lead at the end of the third quarter, extended the lead to double digits in the final quarter and won the game 72–61.\nSamuelson, Williams and Nurse each played the full 40 minutes for UConn. Williams was the player of the game with 19 points, 12 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 steals.\nKansas State (away).\nThe game between UConn and Kansas State, played at their court, was a sellout. The attendance of 12,528 is the largest announced attendance at a women's Division I basketball game this year. The Wildcats had an early lead, up 4–2, but the Huskies scored the next 17 points to quiet the crowd. Connecticut led by 19 at the end of the first quarter, but it did not turn out to be a blowout. Kansas State cut the lead to 11 in the third quarter before UConn scored ten consecutive points to open up a more comfortable margin. The Huskies won the game 75–58 to record their 84th consecutive victory. Samuelson led all scorers with 26 points, while Collier had 22 points, 8 rebounds, 6 steals and 5 blocks.\nOhio State (home).\nThe two top scorers for Connecticut each hoisted an airball in their first shot attempts against Ohio State. The Buckeye's Kelsey Mitchell seemed unstoppable, scoring 19 points in the first half including several dazzling plays. Despite this, the Huskies were still up by six points at halftime. They had led by as many as 12 but Ohio State Responding to Connecticut runs. The third quarter would be different, as both Collier and Samuelson were hitting their shots, and Connecticut outscored Ohio State 30–14. UConn switched defenders on Mitchell asking Dangerfield to take on the task and Mitchell scored only four points in the second half. UConn won, 82–63 extending their win streak to 85 games.\nNebraska (away).\nThe game against Nebraska was never close. The Huskers hit just one of their first 10 shot attempts, and the Huskies led 22–7 at the end of the first quarter. The lead grew to as many as 48 points, giving the team a chance to play extended minutes for the bench. The final score was 84–41 in favor of Connecticut, giving the Huskies their 86th consecutive victory.\nMaryland (away).\nIn a battle of unbeaten teams, UConn took on the Maryland Terrapins in front of a sold-out crowd of 17,950 in Maryland. Samuelson was sick before and during the game, seriously enough that Geno Auriemma wasn't sure she was going to play, but she ended up playing 39 minutes. Although she missed several shots in the first half, she came on strong in the second half and led the team in scoring with 23 points. Nurse played all 40 minutes and scored 19 points. Both Collier and Williams committed fouls early and played significant portions of the second half with four fouls before Collier picked up her fifth and fouled out. The Huskies were leading by five points at halftime but opened up the third quarter with a 14–0 run in just over minutes. They needed almost all of it, as Maryland came roaring back in the fourth quarter cutting the lead to five. With the lead down to six, Chong hit a key three-pointer late in the game to extend the margin to nine points. UConn won 87–81, recording its 87th consecutive victory and their 30th consecutive road victory.\nUCF (away).\nConnecticut opened the conference schedule with a game against UCF in Orlando. Although the Knights had improved under head coach Katie Abrahamson-Henderson, assisted by former UConn star Nykesha Sales, the team was no match for the Huskies, falling 84–48. Connecticut shot well, hitting over 60% of their field goals, and over 40% of their three-point attempts, but committed a season-high 21 turnovers. Collier hit 10 of her 11 field-goal attempts, leading to a team-high 22 points.\nEast Carolina (home).\nUConn played their first conference home game against East Carolina. Chong hit a three-pointer in the opening seconds of the game and the Huskies never trailed. Collier was the leading scorer with 21 points.\nSouth Florida (home).\nUConn faced South Florida in Hartford with a chance to tie the consecutive wins record, set by Connecticut in 2010. At the time, the USF Bulls were the only other ranked team in the American conference. UConn scored 30 points in the first quarter and exceeded that with 35 in the second quarter, but it was the defense, holding South Florida to just six points in the first quarter, and 19 points by halftime, which impressed coach Auriemma. He told the team at halftime, that it ″was as good of a 20 minutes of basketball that any of them have ever been a part of\". UConn won 102–37, the 90th consecutive victory for the team. Chong was the high scorer with 20 points.\nSMU (away).\nFollowing the record-tying 90th consecutive victory, UConn had a chance to seize the record outright against SMU. The Huskies were not interested in suspense, scoring the first 21 points in the game, and finishing with an 88–48 victory to set the new record. Both Collier and Williams recorded double-doubles, with 19 points and 16 rebounds for Collier and 19 and 10 for Williams. Samuelson scored 28 points to lead all scorers. Accolades came in from many observers, including Anucha Browne, the NCAA Vice President of Women's Basketball Championships, who remarked, \"Congratulations to Geno Auriemma and the UConn Huskies on the sustained excellence it has taken to establish a new consecutive games won record. Even though they make it look easy at times, 91 wins and counting is an unbelievable accomplishment. It is saying something when you have broken the all-time consecutive games won record three times. To have won over 70 games in a row three times over the last 14 years is a testament to the UConn student-athletes, coaches, administrators and fans who continue to fuel the program.\"\nTulsa (away).\nIn their first game after setting the new NCAA consecutive wins record, UConn took on Tulsa at the Reynolds Center. The crowd of 1,391 was the smallest for a Huskies' game so far this season; on the other hand, it was the largest crowd to watch a women's basketball game in Tulsa, almost triple the next highest and well above the average attendance of 264. UConn never trailed, and collected their 92nd consecutive win by a score of 98–58. Samuelson set a career-high with 34 points; Williams recorded 13 points, nine rebounds, and eight assists.\nTulane (home).\nSamuelson missed her first five shots from the floor, but she did not stop shooting. In the second and third quarters, she scored 32 points to lead all scorers. Samuelson, having scored 94 points in her last three games, tied a UConn record; Maya Moore scored 94 in a three-game stretch in December 2010. Samuelson also recorded seven steals, a career best. The Huskies did not trail during the game and ended up winning their 93rd consecutive game, 100–56.\nEast Carolina (away).\nThe game against East Carolina was notable more for milestones than for the game itself. In the third quarter, Nurse hit a basket to give her a thousand points in her career. In the fourth quarter, Williams found Natalie Butler for a basket, giving her a triple-double with 16 points, 16 rebounds and 10 assists, the fifth triple-double in UConn women's basketball history. The team went on to win the game 91–44, resulting in an NCAA record 94th consecutive win, as well as the 34th consecutive road game, tying the NCAA record set by UConn in 2004.\nHouston (home).\nFour minutes into the game, Houston grabbed a two-point lead, the first time UConn had trailed since December 11, 2016. The Huskies then went on a 21-0 run to take control of the game. Williams recorded a double-double with 19 points and 10 rebounds, while Samuelson and Nurse scored 16 points apiece. The Huskies won 91-42, their 95th consecutive game.\nTemple (away).\nUConn traveled to the Liacouras Center in Philadelphia to face Temple, coached by former UConn assistant Tonya Cardoza. In the first half, UConn hit 77% of their shot attempts, and held Temple to 18 points, prompting head coach Auriemma to remark, \"I can't think of one thing when we went in at halftime that I could've said, 'We need to do a better job.' That was about as good a first half as we've played, ...\" The Huskies won 97–69, marking their 35th consecutive road win, a new NCAA record, as well as extending their overall win streak to 96. Collier had a double-double with 24 points and 10 rebounds; Samuelson added 25 points.\nTulsa (home).\nThe Huskies shot poorly early in the game against Tulsa, hitting only 33% of their shots in the first quarter. Nevertheless, the team took a lead it would never relinquish, extending a five-point first quarter lead to 17 at halftime. Shots started falling, and the team hit 57% of their field goal attempts for the game. Collier hit 10 of her 13 attempts, raising her season average to 67.5%, good for first in the conference. The final score was 96-50 in favor of Connecticut.\nCincinnati (away).\nUConn faced Cincinnati at Fifth Third Arena before 4029 fans, the largest Cincinnati crowd of the season by far. The Bearcats, under head coach Jamelle Elliott, a former UConn assistant, were having their best season in years, with a 14–9 record, but were no match for Connecticut. UConn's Collier took ten shots and hit all ten, as well as recording 12 rebounds, five blocks and six assists. Three other starters scored in double figures, while Chong added 9. The Huskies claimed their 98th consecutive victory, 96–49. The Huskies also set a new NCAA record for consecutive road victories at 36.\nSMU (home).\nHaving previously defeated SMU by 40 in Dallas, the outcome of the home game against SMU was not the uppermost issue. Samuelson had been unable to practice for the last two days due to illness, and her status was unknown even as game time neared. She did end up playing, and played all 20 minutes of the first half, scoring 19 points. Williams reached 200 rebounds, 100 assists, 50 steals, and 25 blocks for the season, becoming only the third Husky to accomplish this, along with Maya Moore (who was in attendance) and Breanna Stewart. Williams became the first Division I player to reach that milestone in the 2016-2017. UConn won the game 83-41 to extend their winning streak to 99 games.\nSouth Carolina (home).\nAfter a dozen AAC games, in which the margin of victory was never less than 28 points, UConn faced sixth ranked South Carolina before a sellout crowd of 10,167. The game was close in the first half, with South Carolina trailing by no more than four. The Gamecocks were led by A'ja Wilson, who hit five of her eight shots to record 12 points in the first half. UConn recorded a 7–0 run in the end of the half to take a six-point lead at halftime. After South Carolina cut the lead back to three points, the Huskies went on an 11–2 run to end the quarter. The Gamecocks could not trim the margin to single digits in the fourth quarter, and the Huskies went on to win their 100th consecutive game by a score of 66–55. Williams scored 26 points to record a career-high. Watching the game in the stands were former UConn stars Sue Bird, Maya Moore, Tina Charles and Breanna Stewart.\nTulane (away).\nAfter defeating South Carolina in non-conference play, the Huskies returned to conference play against Tulane, still having never lost a game in conference history. UConn started the game on a 10–0 run, but had their worst shooting game of the season, hitting only 38% of their field-goal attempts. The Huskies led by as many as 17 points in the third quarter, but Tulane did not fade. Collier was in foul trouble and had to sit in the third quarter and played with four fouls in the fourth quarter. Tulane hit 7 of 16 field goal attempts in the fourth quarter, cutting the lead to three points. Tulane had the ball for the final possession down just 3, but was unable to get a clear shot before time expired. Nurse did not play for the Huskies, sitting out with an ankle injury, after starting 73 consecutive games. Despite her foul problems and minimal playing time, Collier had a double-double with 26 points and 12 rebounds. UConn held on to win their 101st consecutive game by a score of 63–60, their narrowest margin of victory since their 2-point win against Florida State on opening night.\nTemple (home).\nFollowing the close game against Tulane, UConn returned home to take on Temple, winners of four of their last five and ranked for the first time in a decade. Samuelson had six steals, Williams hit all seven of her field-goal attempts and added seven rebounds, while Collier recorded 31 points, a career-high, hitting 13 of her 14 field-goal attempts, including two three-pointers. The team hit 59% of their field-goal attempts and held the Owls to 27%, winning easily by a score of 90–45.\nMemphis (home).\nUConn faced Memphis on Senior Day, honoring their two seniors Saniya Chong and Tierney Lawler in pregame ceremonies. Lawler started for the first time in her career and assisted on a pass to Samuelson which resulted in a four-point play on the first possession of the game. Samuelson came into the game having hit just 11 of her previous 44 three-point attempts, but she hit five of her eight attempts in this game. The team hit 55% of their field-goal attempts while holding Memphis to 32%. UConn would go on to win their 103rd straight game, 91–48.\nUSF (away).\nUConn closed the regular-season in the same way they opened it — with a trip to Florida. In the opening game, the Huskies escaped with a two-point win over Florida State; in the final regular-season game, they won by 28 points, 96–68, over South Florida. Collier hit 15 of her 19 field-goal attempts, including two of three 3 point attempts, and hit seven of her eight free-throw attempts to record 39 points, the fourth most ever by UConn player. Only Nykesha Sales who scored 46 points in 1997 and Maya Moore, who scored 40 and 41 points during her career, had higher point totals. Samuelson scored 16 to join the career 1000 point club.\nAAC tournament.\nTulsa (quarter-final).\nAfter a first round bye, UConn faced Tulsa in the AAC quarterfinals. The game was close early on, with UConn holding only a four-point lead 14–10, but UConn put the game away with a 37-7 run. Collier hit seven of her nine field-goal attempts and led all scorers with 24 points. UConn ended up with 105 points, matching the total of their win streak. The final score was 105–57.\nUCF (semifinal).\nUConn took on the University of Central Florida in the semifinal game of the tournament. Although the Huskies uncharacteristically missed a number of shots, missing 12 of the 17 shots in the second quarter, they improved in the second half and extended the 12 point halftime lead to more than 20 points. The Knights were aggressive in the paint, recording six offensive rebounds in the first quarter, but were unable to convert enough rebounds to take the lead. The Huskies ended up with the win 78–56 to advance to the championship game.\nSouth Florida (Championship).\nThe championship game was between UConn and South Florida. Under usual circumstances, the result of a conference tournament game would be the main story. In this case, the Huskies won the game easily 100–44 to win the American conference championship and keep two streaks alive — they've never lost a game against an American conference opponent and they have now won 107 consecutive games. Both of those accomplishments were overshadowed by Samuelson who took 10 field-goal attempts from beyond the heart arc and hit every one of them. She left the game with just over two minutes left in the third quarter to a \"thunderous ovation\". The 10-for-10 from beyond the arc establishes a new record for NCAA women's basketball is the most three-point shots made without a miss. One men's basketball player, Andre Smith, hit 10 of 10 in 2008 in a men's NCAA game. No NBA player has ever accomplished the feat.\nSamuelson ended up with 40 points, establishing a new career high, and the most points ever scored in an American athletic conference tournament game. It was the fourth 40 point performance in the history of UConn with only Nykesha Sales who scored 46 and Maya Moore, with two games, one with 41 points and the other, 40 points.\nNCAA tournament.\nConnecticut took on the America East champion, in a first-round game between the top-seeded Huskies and the 16 seed Albany. The Huskies scored the first nine points, but the great Danes cut the lead to three points 10–7 early in the first quarter. Despite leading 58–32 at halftime, the halftime discussion among the players was how to boost their intensity on defense. The Huskies held Albany to 23 points in the second half and went on to win the game 116-55.\nThe Huskies went on to beat Syracuse, UCLA, and Oregon before falling to No. 7 Mississippi State with a buzzer beater in overtime in the final four. The loss ended the Huskies record winning streak with 111 wins.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Exhibition\n!colspan=12 style=\"| Regular season\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"|AAC Women's Tournament\n!colspan=12 style=\"\"|NCAA Women's Tournament"

The tournaments consisted of Tour Stops and formed part of the FIVB Beach Volleyball World Tour. The series concluded with the FIVB World Tour Finals.\nEach tournament in the series had a prize pool of US$300,000 per gender, except for the World Tour Finals which had a prize pool of US$400,000 per gender.\nHistory.\nThe Beach Volleyball Major Series arose out of a joint-venture between Austrian companies Red Bull and the ACTS Group.\nRed Bull was established in 1987 by Dietrich Mateschitz. Aside from the energy drink, Red Bull's direct marketing focuses heavily on sports and lifestyle.\nACTS Group is a marketing agency founded in 1990 by Hannes Jagerhofer.
