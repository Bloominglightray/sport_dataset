        "text": "2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa is the official video game for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, published by EA Sports and available on iOS and all major seventh-generation platforms except the Nintendo DS. Announced in January 2010 during an interview with one of the producers of the game, it was released 27 April 2010 in North America. 199 of the 204 teams that took part in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification are included in the game.\nGameplay.\nPlayers choose a team from the 199 nations available and compete against the computer or against other players through online gaming services PlayStation Network or Xbox Live. All 10 official World Cup stadiums are available for play.\nEA has announced that there will be gameplay improvements over \"FIFA 10\", such as a higher rate of player fatigue for matches at higher altitudes, with an advantage to a home team who plays at a higher altitude against an away team who does not. EA has also announced that players can get injured outside international matches.\nEA has also announced that the \"Captain Your Country\" mode will return, similar to the \"Be a Pro\" mode and that \"FIFA 10\" owners can import their Virtual Pro for this purpose and then earn CYC Accomplishments and attribute boosts. The game's penalty kick mechanism has been changed for their outcome to better reflect the player's own composure. In addition, the game's online multiplayer lobby system has been limited to unranked head-to-head matches. As in \"2006 FIFA World Cup\", a \"scenario\" mode is included with 55 playable scenarios from past World Cup matches. Scenarios from the 2010 World Cup are also playable with an online update.\nThe Wii version of the game features more stylised graphics and utilises a nuanced physics system to allow for more casual, arcade-style gameplay. This version supports multiple control schemes, including the Classic Controller. Exclusively in this version, players are required to use quick-time events to save free kicks or penalty shots, or to win possession of the ball after goal kicks and corner kicks. It is also possible for multiple players to take control of one team in that version.\nThe game includes Clive Tyldesley and Andy Townsend as the commentators, who provide insight into both sides during matches.\nTeams and venues.\nThe included teams were confirmed by Electronic Arts on 17 February 2010. The game contains 199 of the 204 national teams that took part in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification phase. Electronic Arts stated that they have included every team that FIFA have permitted them to use, with some others not being allowed for \"various reasons\". The five teams that were in the draw for World Cup qualifying but are not included in the game are the Central African Republic, Eritrea and São Tomé and Príncipe from Africa and Asian teams Bhutan and Guam. All five withdrew from the qualifying stage before it began. Additionally, the game does not feature Brunei, Laos, Papua New Guinea and the Philippines, who did not participate in World Cup qualification.\nThe game includes all 10 venues used at the 2010 FIFA World Cup, as well as stadiums from each qualifying region and a range of \"generic\" stadiums.\nBackground.\nDevelopment.\n\"2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\" was in development for 12 months, and had two separate teams working on it: gameplay team and core team. The gameplay team was led by Gary Patterson, the creative director for FIFA games. Meanwhile, the core team designed the game modes and audio/visual presentation, among other things. EA Sports wanted to shape World Cup in a way that it would be able to match \"FIFA 10\". They decided to release it as a standalone game, rather than downloadable content, citing the size, scope and the uniqueness of the covered event.\nBecause the game focused on a single event, EA Sports was trying to secure a complete authenticity by working with FIFA and the host nation. Several members went to South Africa and recorded the vuvuzela noise during actual football games, in order to capture the atmosphere over there. Adding to the variety, each nation got its own fully rendered crowd in-game. The developers were also influenced by African themes in other areas, such as the soundtrack and menus.\nRelease.\nThe game was announced on 26 January 2010, in a GameSpot interview with the line producer of the game, Simon Humber, with a slated release date for 27 April 2010 in North America, and 30 April 2010, in Asia and Europe.\nA playable demo was released for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 on 8 April 2010. It includes Italy and Spain as the playable teams, and the ability to upload video replays to EA Football World.\nSoundtrack.\nThe \"2010 FIFA World Cup\" soundtrack comprises 28 tracks by artists from 21 countries. According to Electronic Arts it is intended to be a soundtrack that \"celebrates the cultural vibrancy of the first FIFA World Cup to be held in Africa\". The headline track is \"Wavin' Flag (Coca-Cola Celebration Mix)\" by K'naan.\nReception.\nThe game was met with positive to mixed reception. GameRankings and Metacritic gave it a score of 83.43% and 83 out of 100 for the Xbox 360 version; 82.82% and 82 out of 100 for the PlayStation 3 version; 71.50% and 69 out of 100 for the PSP version; 69% and 70 out of 100 for the Wii version; and 62.50% for the iOS version.\nSales.\nAs of May 2010, the game sold nearly 2 million units worldwide.\nLegacy.\nAs of 2022, the game is generally considered to be the best of the modern EA Sports FIFA World Cup video games, as well as one of the greatest football games of all time.

        "title": "Volleyball offensive systems",
        "text": "Volleyball offensive systems are the ways in which a coach can personalize and tweak his or her team's offense based on each player's skill level to make the team as competitive as possible. This is done by using different formations that allow a team to use a variety of volleyball attacks. A team on offense will try to increase the probability of winning a point on a hit by confusing the opposing blockers and disguising the setter's intended receiver as much as possible. This is done keeping in mind that the goal is to score a point and that running a successful offense is executed differently for every team. Teams use offensive systems in whatever way suits the team best.\nPreview.\nVolleyball offense is how a team can attempt to score a point by causing the ball to land on the opposing teams side of the court. Generally, this is done by first receiving the ball from the other side in the form of either an attack or serve, having the ball set to an attacker, and then having a player jump and attack the ball. Once the ball is received, the goal is to get the ball where it can be hit most effectively. This is usually close to the net where an attacker can jump and hit the ball. Based on a teams skill level, they will be able to run their offense smoothly with a unique arsenal of attacks and formations.\nAttacks.\nBasic.\nThe basics sets are used by teams that do not yet have the experience to run more complicated plays. Any more advanced set, relative to the team skill level, should be used sparingly so the opposing block is tricked by thinking the set is merely a basic set.\n4: A 4 is a high set to the left antenna where an outside (left front) attacker may hit it. \n2: A 2 is a high set to the middle (middle front) attacker about 2 feet above the tape of the net.\n5: A 5 is a high set to the right antenna where an opposite (right front) attacker may hit it.\nPipe: A pipe is a high set to the middle back right behind the 10' line where a back row attacker may hit it.\n3: A 3 (also referred to as a 32 or 33) is a shoot set between the outside and middle hitters. Much like a combination of a 1 and a shoot.\n1: A 1 (also referred to as a quick) is a low set that is set about 1' above the tape of the net for the middle attacker\nAdvanced.\nThese more complicated sets are meant to fool the opposition and get your attacker with 1 blocker or less. At higher levels, teams will use a basic set if it is a last resort, meaning that the ball was received poorly.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nShoot: A shoot or Go-ball is a quick, low set to the left-front hitter near the antenna.&lt;br&gt;\n32: A 32 (pronounced three-two) is a set to the left-front hitter halfway in between the middle of the net and the antenna about the height of a two ball.&lt;br&gt;\nFlare: A flare is when an attacker uses an inside-out path to attack an outside set. A teammate commonly runs a quick fake to trick the opponents, then the attacker flares out to attack.&lt;br&gt;\nSlide: A slide is a set to any attacker who runs parallel to the net and jumps off of one foot.&lt;br&gt;\nIso: An isolation play is a play where you use an attacker, usually the middle, as a decoy to leave another attacker with a weaker opposing block.&lt;br&gt;\nTandem: A tandem is when one attack follows another and hits the ball right after the first one lands, using the first attacker as a decoy.&lt;br&gt;\nDouble quick: A double quick is when two attackers take an approach towards the setter so that he or she may set either a 1 or a back 1, which is a 1 set over the shoulder of the setter.&lt;br&gt;\nX: An x is when a middle goes up for a 1 and the right side attacker comes from the other side to hit a 2, making the two paths of the hitters cross.\nFormations.\nIn volleyball, teams must have their players in a specific formation. The players then rotate around the court clockwise whenever the team performs a side-out. There is a penalty for being out of rotation and the opposing team receives a point. There are three formations that are widely used in the sport, each having advantages and disadvantages.\n4-2.\nThis offense takes its name from the fact that it uses 4 attackers and two setters. This is a basic formation generally used by less experienced teams to avoid confusion on the court. At any given time, one of the setters is front row and the other is back row. They are always opposite of each other on the court. This allows for 2 attackers front row at any given time, and the setter is able to dump the ball as the setter will always be in the front court. This basic offensive formation allows for any of the basic sets to be run, as well as a 32, shoot, or possibly a tandem. Teams that use a 4-2 will rarely set anything other than the basic sets. The positive aspects of the 4-2 include its simplicity, so a team can gain experience and later move on to a more complicated formation. The negative aspect of using a 4-2 is its limits regarding your offense. Some think that having two setters takes away from your team as the setter is generally the team leader. Some coaches opt to start their team out running a more complicated system and just having the players adopt it.\n5-1.\nA 5-1 takes its name from using 1 setter and having 5 attackers on the court. The secondary setter is replaced by an opposite hitter who is always opposite the setter on the court. This formation allows the setter to be able to dump the ball for half the rotations and have 3 front row attackers to set the ball to on the other three rotations. This system allows the setter to set any possible set he or she wants to depending on whether he or she is front row or back row. Many coaches prefer this system, having one setter as the team leader. It also helps having only one setter so that the setting does not change. One setter may set the ball differently from another giving a different feel for the attackers. It helps when the attackers are used to one setter in particular. The negative points of this offense are that the setter needs to transition from defense to set the ball. This creates situations where the setter has the first contact and someone else has to set the ball.\n6-2.\nA 6-2 is similar to a 4-2, but has 6 attackers and 2 setters. This is possible by having the back row setter always set the ball, making the setter only a hitter when he or she is front row. This formation allows any possible set to be made not including a dump by the setter because he or she is always back row when setting the ball. This formation is good for a team in which the setters are also very good attackers where coach does not want to waste that talent. Some young teams also use it so that the player can increase a broad range of skills and not be sentenced to being a setter for his or her career. Unfortunately, this formation has the problems of 5-1 and 4-2. Having two setters, and always having one of them be back row. The setter always has to transition from defense and the leadership is lacking. Most teams at the highest level, including the USA Olympic team use the 5-1 rather than this for leadership purposes. A 6-2 offense is very common when a team has two setters of equal ability and at a younger age."

He played as a flanker for Newbridge RFC, and won six caps for Wales during the period 1967–1970. He later worked as a sales manager for Biomet at Bridgend.\nDennis was selected for three matches in Wales' 1970 Five Nations campaign, playing against Scotland, England and Ireland. During the match at Twickenham, he played a part in Chico Hopkins' memorable appearance. When Gareth Edwards and Dennis both missed a tackle on Nigel Starmer-Smith, the two Wales players collided, resulting in an injury to Edwards who was unable to continue. This gave replacement Chico his one and only cap for his country. He took the field twenty minutes from full time and inspired the team to an impressive comeback. England had gained the upper hand and were winning 13 points to 6 until Chico made a try for JPR and followed up with a try of his own from the back of a lineout. Wales still needed a successful conversion to take a one-point lead. JPR Williams duly obliged and Barry John added a drop goal well into a long injury time."

        "text": "Stage 12 of the 2007 Giro d'Italia took place on 24 May; the race concluded on 3 June. The second half of the Giro began with a challenging mountain stage that finished outside Italy, the first of three stages in this Giro that did so. This stage resulted in the race lead transferring from Andrea Noè to his teammate and team leader Danilo Di Luca, who did not relinquish this lead and finished the race as its champion.\nThe battle for the other two spots on the Giro podium also began in stage 12 but was not resolved until later in the race. Andy Schleck from won the white jersey in Milan as the Giro's best rider under 25, and was in a competition with Eddy Mazzoleni, Gilberto Simoni, Damiano Cunego, and Riccardo Riccò to see who would round out the podium with Di Luca. It was in the marquee stages of the second half of the race that Schleck and Mazzoleni distinguished themselves as podium favorites, eventually finishing the race second and third overall, respectively. showed well, with Riccò and Simoni both taking mountain stage wins and Leonardo Piepoli winning the green jersey in Milan as the Giro's best climber.\nAlessandro Petacchi from won two stages in the second half of the Giro, and the points classification, but his subsequent disqualification for a non-negative salbutamol test given earlier in the race nullified these victories.\nStage 12.\nThis was the first major mountain stage of the Giro. The course included two difficult first-category climbs, as the route passed from Italy into France. The first of these climbs was the Colle dell'Agnello, which crested just inside the French border. This was the \"Cima Coppi\", the highest climb in the race. The climb took stretched for and reached a vertical elevation of . The Col d'Izoard later on is only marginally shorter and less steep, reaching in elevation after on the road, for a steady 7.1% gradient. The finish came on a steep descent into Briançon, a popular host town for the Tour de France.\nThis France-bound stage had a breakaway group consisting of two French riders each representing a French team: Yoann Le Boulanger of and Christophe Riblon of . By the mark, the duo had a 17 and a half minute advantage on the peloton, as the other riders were conserving themselves for the big climbs ahead. The team, and in particular Leonardo Piepoli, did the pacemaking on the ascent of the Colle dell'Agnello, and after a few kilometers of the climb only a select group of overall favorites remained together as the first chase group. One surprising rider to crack was two-time Giro winner Paolo Savoldelli, who lost contact with the group of favorites from the summit of the Agnello and lost five minutes to them at day's end. Savoldelli was still hurt from the previous day's crash, and informed his lieutenant Eddy Mazzoleni that he should keep the pace for as long as he could and ride his own race, and that Savoldelli would look after himself.\nIn the front of the race, Le Boulanger was the first over the Agnello, winning the prize that went with conquering the \"Cima Coppi\". Riblon followed 1'30\" behind him; the group of overall favorites was still 13 minutes behind at the summit of the climb. Piepoli's pacemaking on the ascent had succeeded in whittling the group down to just himself, Gilberto Simoni, Damiano Cunego, Danilo Di Luca, Mazzoleni, Andy Schleck, and Stefano Garzelli. Riccardo Riccò, Savoldelli, Yaroslav Popovych, and overnight race leader Andrea Noè had all been in this group at the beginning of the climb, but were all eventually cracked by the pace.\nPiepoli continued to pull the Simoni group through the descent from the Agnello and the beginning of the Iozard climb, absorbing Riblon in the process. Le Boulanger was alone in the front of the race as the ascent of the Iozard began, 3 minutes ahead of Simoni's group. With left in the climb, Piepoli broke away from the group he had been pacing, in a move to see who could match his acceleration. Di Luca and Schleck quickly made the bridge, with Simoni holding their wheels, but Cunego and Garzelli did not react as quickly and had to expend more energy to stay with the leaders. Later, Garzelli was dropped by this group's pace, and lost 2 minutes to them at the finish line. This group caught Le Boulanger before the summit of the Iozard.\nSeconds before reaching that summit, Di Luca attacked from the leading group and came free, taking maximum mountains points and, more importantly, opening up a time gap. He opened up a 13-second lead on Schleck, Simoni, and Mazzoleni, and 25 to Cunego. Piepoli faded further and out of contention, at last hitting the wall after doing some strenuous pacemaking for much of this difficult stage. Simoni's descending skills brought himself, Schleck, and Mazzoleni back together with Di Luca minutes later, and they were together in Briançon for the stage finish. Di Luca attacked for the stage win from the finish line, after a sharp right-hand turn, and drew Schleck with him. Simoni went à bloc in his attempt to reach them, and did pass Schleck, but could not come around Di Luca, who won the stage. The others in the leading group of five finished scattered behind them. 's Marzio Bruseghin, who had begun the day second in the overall standings, was in the second chase group most of the day and finished 2'33\" back, retaining second overall. Noè was 9'45\" off the pace and surrendered the pink jersey to his team leader Di Luca. Di Luca still held the green jersey as mountains classification leader after the stage; Piepoli wore it in the next three stages.\nStage 13.\nThe Giro's first individual time trial consisted entirely of the first-category climb to the Santuario di Oropa. The route was uphill all the way, gaining at an average gradient of 5.8%, with the steepest stretches reaching 13%. Though noted to be a difficult climb, it was expected that the short length of this stage would limit its effect on the overall standings.\nThe first rider of the day to post a time under 30 minutes was 's Julio Alberto Pérez. His 29'38\" was eventually bettered by American time trial specialist David Zabriskie, who stopped the clock at 29'14\". Leonardo Piepoli started slowly, well behind Zabriskie at the intermediate time check, but finished strongly, gaining 4 seconds on Zabriskie at the check and 18 at the finish line. ' Evgeni Petrov posted the best time at the first intermediate time check, but faded as the course wore on and could not beat Piepoli's time. Riccardo Riccò, Franco Pellizotti, Andy Schleck, Damiano Cunego, and Gilberto Simoni all posted solid times, but all fell short of overtaking Piepoli.\nThe last two men to take the course were Italian national time trial champion Marzio Bruseghin and race leader Danilo Di Luca. Bruseghin had the second best splits at the first two intermediate time checks and gained against Piepoli in the final where the others had lost time to him, winning the stage by a single second. Di Luca also rode well, finishing 8 seconds back of Bruseghin, and gaining time on his major rivals. After the stage, Simoni expressed disappointment that Piepoli was so narrowly defeated after having worked so hard the day before. Bruseghin held second overall after the stage and slightly narrowed his time gap to Di Luca, but made it clear that his focus going forward would be to work for team leader Cunego and not for any individual aspirations.\nStage 14.\nThe first of this stage were flat, but two categorized climbs followed. The second-category Passo di San Marco and the third-category La Trinità-Dossena had a descent between them. Though a flat stretch followed to the finish, it was not likely that any sprinters would be present in the leading group to contest the stage.\nThe morning breakaway numbered eleven. During the flat stretch before the Passo di San Marco climb, Stefano Garzelli tried to use his team to soften the main field so he could attack and bridge up to the leaders, but team , working for race leader Danilo Di Luca, nullified the move.\nThe group thinned after cresting the climb, leaving only Iván Parra, Paolo Bettini, and Fortunato Baliani just less than two minutes ahead of the pink jersey group, which contained all of the race's overall favorites. Garzelli and teammate Massimo Codol came free of this group on the ascent of La Trinità-Dossena and drew Gilberto Simoni and the powerful duo of Eddy Mazzoleni and Paolo Savoldelli with them. The three breakaway riders were able to stay with them, forming a leading group of seven, after Codol dropped after doing some strenuous pacemaking. They built a 30-second advantage over the pink jersey group, as Liquigas was spent from their earlier effort to keep the race together. They kept their advantage over the other race favorites at that level for most of the stage, contesting a sprint finish among themselves 38 seconds ahead of Di Luca in eighth. Simoni opened the sprint first, with to go to the finish line, but as is so often the case, the first to go was not the winner. Garzelli passed him up with left and won his first Giro stage in three years. Simoni moved up from eighth to fifth after the stage, and several time gaps tightened with the day's results.\nStage 15.\nThis was the Giro's queen stage, featuring four categorized climbs along with an uncategorized wall early on. It concluded at the picturesque Tre Cime di Lavaredo with a demanding final climb, only long but with a steady 7.6% grade and stretches of over 20%.\nAfter a flurry of morning attacks and counterattacks resulted in no group coming clear, the right combination formed after close to an hour and covered. By the mark, the 22-strong breakaway representing 17 teams had three minutes on the main field. Their advantage eventually grew to nearly seven minutes, but with such difficult parcours ahead, they stood little chance of staying away.\nAfter on the Passo di San Pellegrino, the day's first climb, sent Leonardo Piepoli and Riccardo Riccò on the attack. Iván Parra and Julio Alberto Pérez followed, and they quickly gapped the pink jersey group while trying to bridge up to the leaders. They reached the leading group after the descent of the San Pellegrino, holding four minutes on the pink jersey group at that time. Saunier Duval–Prodir rider David Cañada, part of the original big breakaway, set to the pacemaking once his two teammates joined the group, and tapped out a tempo that cracked about half of the group. When Cañada faded, Piepoli took his turn on the front of the group, at which time only Riccò, Pérez, Parra, and Michael Rasmussen were with him. Piepoli led them over the second-category Passo di Giau together, a little over three minutes ahead of the main field.\nThe pink jersey group was, during the Giau climb, some 50 riders strong until Paolo Savoldelli took a pull on the front, working for the better-placed Eddy Mazzoleni, that absolutely shattered it. Race leader Danilo Di Luca lost all of his support riders from the group, and overall contenders Damiano Cunego and Marzio Bruseghin were also quickly gapped. With remaining to the summit of the Giau, Di Luca put in an attack that further broke up the field. Savoldelli was gapped for a time, but his aggressive descent from the Giau brought him back to the pink jersey group, where he again took a strenuous pull on the front, softening up the contenders enough for himself and Mazzoleni to break free.\nThe intermediate sprint in Cortina d'Ampezzo resulted in Rasmussen coming out the back of the leading group. Savoldelli and Mazzoleni caught him in the road, and the Dutchman stayed with them to form a three-man chase group. Rain began to fall on the ascent of the Passo Tre Croci, the day's third climb, making the goings even more difficult. The leading group of four had 1'24\" on the Mazzoleni group at the top of Passo Tre Croci and a further three minutes on the pink jersey group, meaning Mazzoleni was very nearly the virtual race leader on the road. Mazzoleni dropped Savoldelli and Rasmussen as the stage went on, and finished five minutes before them.\nOn the last ascent of the day, the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, Di Luca made up much of the ground he had in deficit to Mazzoleni on the road, conceding a minute and 24 seconds to him at the finish line. Gilberto Simoni, Damiano Cunego, and Andy Schleck finished just behind him. In the front of the race, Riccò attacked as the Lavaredo climb began and quickly got a 15-second gap. The only rider to bridge to him was his teammate Piepoli. Piepoli, having taken the lead outright in the mountains classification, allowed Riccò the stage win. Their team leader Simoni reflected after the stage that he thought their early break was foolhardy, and that he had not followed because he was focused only on the overall and not stages, but that he was happy that the team took the Giro's marquee stage.\nThe true difficulty of the stage was demonstrated by the time gaps and finishing groups. Most of the riders finished the stage alone; no more than five finished together. Only 18 other riders finished within ten minutes of Riccò's winning time, and 78 lost more than half an hour, with 's Franck Rénier last on the day 40 minutes and 10 seconds off the pace.\nStage 16.\nAfter the second rest day, the Giro returned with a rolling stage that entered Austria. The stage began with the second-category Passo di Campolongo and a long descent from it, but the remaining terrain was not difficult enough for any riders to open up significant time gaps. Pre-race analysis thus found it to be an ideal stage for a winning breakaway.\nThe peloton's pace in this stage was extremely lax. Through the first hour, they covered only . The second hour was even slower, covering . No breakaways were attempted in this time, save for a quick sprint for the mountains points available on the Passo di Campolongo. Through three hours, there was still no breakaway.\nFinally, with only left in the stage, Benoît Joachim and Laurent Mangel came free. The team at the head of the peloton was uninterested in chasing them down, since only a stage win was on offer this day, with the overall standings very unlikely to change. Little by little, sixteen others joined them. They did not work cohesively; Mangel, Stefano Garzelli, Ricardo Serrano, José Luis Rubiera, Pietro Caucchioli, and Pablo Lastras took two minutes' advantage over the other twelve. This mattered little, as the apathetic peloton let them all go to contest the stage amongst themselves. Garzelli put in an attack on the third-category Bannberg climb, from the end of the race, and stayed out front for the stage win. The main field, led home by László Bodrogi, was 8 minutes and 10 seconds back, but there was no significant change to the overall classification.\nStage 17.\nThis stage brought the riders back into Italy. It was short, but it ended at one of the most difficult climbs in the world, Monte Zoncolan. The climb gains in for a crushing average gradient of almost 12%, and stretches of up to 22%. The Giro previously passed over the Zoncolan in 2003, in a stage won by Gilberto Simoni en route to overall victory.\nRace leader Danilo Di Luca's team covered many early breakaway attempts. After , a dozen-strong breakaway group formed. Their pace was frantic, coming to the stage's intermediate sprint 20 minutes faster than the fastest time predicted by Giro organizers. They had five and a half minutes on the pink jersey group containing race favorites at this point, and three and a half minutes on them at the beginning of the Zoncolan climb.\nJussi Veikkanen, Massimo Codol, and Mauricio Ardila took pulls at the front of the breakaway group, but into the climb, only Dario Cioni, Fortunato Baliani, and Mario Aerts remained out front. Another kilometer later, Cioni was the lone leader. Franco Pellizotti was the last Liquigas rider left for Di Luca in the group of favorites, before he cracked and also fell off the pace. With left in the climb, Simoni himself came to the front of the group and tapped out a pace that left everyone but teammate Leonardo Piepoli and best young rider Andy Schleck behind. They passed Cioni and chaser Codol on the road, and the duo left the young Luxembourger behind them to contest the stage themselves. Since the climb had personal significance for Simoni, Piepoli allowed him to cross the line first. They had covered the climb in 39'05\", for a paltry pace of . The win moved Simoni into a podium position, in third, and moved Schleck into second overall.\nStage 18.\nThe 18th stage was completely flat, and was sure to be contested by the Giro's remaining sprinters.\nA great number of early breakaways were attempted and neutralized in the stage's first hour. Finally, seven broke away at the mark. The seven, Addy Engels, Maxim Gourov, Patxi Vila, Franck Rénier, Éric Berthou, Pedro Horrillo and Mikhail Ignatiev, got a maximum advantage of 2'30\", but the peloton easily caught them from the finish line. tried to set up the sprint for Alexandre Usov, as did for Matteo Tosatto, who lived in the town where the stage finished. AG2R's leadout train took a left-hand turn in the final kilometer too sharply, and left a handful of riders to contest the stage alone. Since the crash occurred within the final , no time was counted as lost. Alessandro Petacchi easily held off Maximiliano Richeze and Matti Breschel for the victory, though this was one of his many 2007 wins that was later stripped due to his irregular salbutamol levels in a test given earlier in the race. The overall standings were unchanged by the day's results.\nStage 19.\nTwo categorized climbs occurred on this course, but since the stage took place one day before a long and likely crucial individual time trial, pre-race analysis determined this stage likely to be decided by a breakaway.\nA breakaway group involving double stage winner Stefano Garzelli got away after , but was brought back later after never having more than 45 seconds on the main field. Iban Mayo and Alberto Losada counter-attacked when the original break was brought in, and stayed out front for much of the stage. rode tempo through the mark, until Leonardo Piepoli put in an attack for maximum mountains points on the second-category Pian del Fugazze. He was caught shortly thereafter, but the pace he set severely thinned the pink jersey group.\nA chase group of five riders formed between the pink jersey group and Mayo and Losada in the front of the race, but they were never able to make the bridge. Losada cracked on the day's final climb and finished 4 minutes behind Mayo, the stage winner. Evgeni Petrov, who began the day in eighth place overall, was part of the chase group and gained sufficient time to move into seventh place at day's end.\nStage 20.\nThe race's second individual time trial was fairly straightforward, albeit long. It was mostly flat and did not have many turns in the road, thus favoring traditional time trial specialists for the stage win.\nMikhail Ignatiev set the first competitive time of the day. His 54'21\" was almost two minutes better than the times that had come before him. Not long after came United States national time trial champion David Zabriskie, who bettered Ignatiev's time at all three intermediate time checks and was over a minute better than him at the finish, the first rider under 53 minutes on the day. Paolo Savoldelli came a little later and stopped the clock in 52'20\".\nLater on, the race's overall favorites took to the road not expressly for the stage win, but rather to iron out the race's overall standings. Savoldelli's teammate Eddy Mazzoleni rode one of the best time trials of his career, 2 seconds better than Zabriskie and 36 back of his teammate to move up from fifth to third overall. Damiano Cunego and Gilberto Simoni, both noted as relatively weak time trialists, lost out on their chances for the podium because of Mazzoleni's ride and settled among themselves the battle for fourth place. Cunego's 54'37\" meant Simoni would have to come home better than 55'38\" to stay better than his rival. Simoni's time was 55'03\", and he remained ahead of Cunego. Danilo Di Luca and Andy Schleck also rode strong time trials, to preserve their places on top of the overall classification with a ceremonial final stage left to race.\nStage 21.\nThe final stage was flat, containing, per tradition, one early categorized climb. It ended with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia in Milan preceding a mass sprint finish.\nKurt Asle Arvesen and Daniele Contrini briefly broke away early in the stage, but they did not seriously seek to stay away. The peloton was together into Milan. Various breakaway attempts occurred on the Milan circuit, but none succeeded. Alessandro Petacchi won the resultant field sprint, though this was one of his many 2007 wins that was later stripped due to his irregular salbutamol levels in a test given earlier in the race. There were no significant changes to the race's standings, so Danilo Di Luca became the Giro champion."

        "text": "James Edward Anderson (April 20, 1937 – March 4, 2024) was an American college basketball player and coach. He was a longtime assistant at Oregon State University (OSU) to head coaches Paul Valenti and Ralph Miller, given credit for recruiting a series of top-level players to the school during the 1970s and 1980s. Anderson assumed the role as head coach of men's basketball at OSU from 1989 to 1995, compiling a record of 79–90.\nAnderson was inducted as a member of the Oregon State Hall of Fame and the Pac-12 Hall of Honor.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nJimmy Anderson was born April 20, 1937, in Britton, South Dakota, to Harry and Mary Anderson. He was the third-born of a family of five children. \nBefore he was old enough to enter school, the Anderson family moved to the town of Hoquiam, Washington. It was there that Anderson was raised, attending a Catholic grade school before eventually enrolling in Hoquiam High School. Anderson was a three-sport athlete at Hoquiam High, playing basketball, football, and baseball at the varsity level.\nCollege playing career.\nAnderson did not initially draw offers for a collegiate athletic scholarship, so he enrolled at Grays Harbor Junior College where he walked on to the basket ball team. It was playing for Grays Harbor that he first gained the notice of Oregon State College (today's Oregon State University), when he was viewed in a game by assistant football coach Jerry Long. Long passed on information about the \"feisty little guard\" that he had seen to OSC head coach Amory \"Slats\" Gill, who investigated further. Anderson was subsequently offered a \"full-ride\" basketball scholarship to OSC for the 1957-58 season.\nAnderson played on OSC teams that won three Far West Classic titles and a Pacific Coast Conference championship in 1958. In his 1959 senior season he was named to the Classic's all-tournament team.\nWhile at OSU he was a member of Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity. He graduated in 1959.\nAfter graduation, Anderson pursued a Master's degree, which he followed up with a two-year stint as a teacher and coach at Newberg High School in Newberg, Oregon.\nCoaching career.\nAnderson's coaching debut as coach came in 1960, when he was named head coach of the freshman team. During this era of collegiate athletics, freshmen were not permitted to play on varsity squads, but instead played for one year on parallel units against their peers at other schools. During Anderson's three-year tenure as head coach of Oregon State's rooks, the Beavers compiled a record of 45–7.\nAnderson began his stint as assistant varsity coach under head coach Paul Valenti in 1964, continuing in that role when the position was assumed by future Hall of Fame coach Ralph Miller. Of critical importance among his duties for both of these coaches was West coast scouting and recruiting, the bulk of which was under his control.\nAnderson gained a reputation as an outstanding recruiter for OSU and is regarded as instrumental in the success of the men's basketball program during the 1970s and 1980s. Career NBA player and coach Lester Conner recalled how Anderson spent almost an entire year recruiting him to Oregon State when he was a sophomore playing in California in junior college. \"He followed me everywhere,\" Conner recalled. \"Street kid from the rough streets of Oakland, a Caucasian man — that's hard for us to do. You know, the trust factor and everything else... If it wasn't for Jimmy, I wouldn't have gone to Oregon State. I owe all the credit in the world to Jimmy Anderson.\"\nNBA All-Star and 11-year player Steve Johnson similarly gave Anderson great credit for the success of the OSU team in the 1970s and 1980s. \"It was a combination of Ralph's record and his street cred,\" Johnson said. \"Ralph was gruff, Jimmy was the personable one — the one you could go to.\"\nOther future NBA players recruited by Anderson to Oregon State included Freddie Boyd, Lonnie Shelton, Ray Blume, Mark Radford, Charlie Sitton, A. C. Green, Brent Barry, and Gary Payton.\nIn his first season at Oregon State, he was named the Pac-10 Coach of the Year and led the Beavers to the 1990 NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament, the school's last NCAA Tournament appearance until 2015.\nA smooth transition from the legendary Miller to his vaunted assistant proved impossible, however, and the OSU program faltered over the next five years, leading to Anderson's dismissal following the disappointing 1994–95 season.\nPersonal life.\nAnderson married the former Fifi Quisenberry, a woman he met while working as a teacher's assistant in a health class. The couple remained together for 63 years, raising a family of four children.\nAnderson was a lifelong partisan of Oregon State athletics, holding season tickets to the school's men's and women's basketball, football, and baseball programs throughout his life.\nDeath and legacy.\nAnderson died on March 4, 2024, at the age of 86.\nAt the time of his death, Anderson was honored with a statement from US Senator Ron Wyden, who declared, \"The history of it cannot be written without a huge chapter on Jimmy Anderson, a class act who played a big role over the years in OSU basketball.\"\nAnderson was inducted as a member of the Oregon State Hall of Fame and the Pac-12 Hall of Honor."

Canada won its first gold medal at an Olympic Games it hosted, having failed to do so at both the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal and the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary. Canada finished first in gold medal wins and became the first host nation since Norway in 1952 to lead the gold medal count, with 14. Canada also broke the record for the most golds won at a single Winter Olympics, which was previously 13, set by the Soviet Union in 1976 and Norway in 2002. The United States placed first in total medals—its second time doing so in a Winter Games—and set a record for most medals won at a single Winter Olympics, with 37, breaking the previous record of 36, set by Germany in 2002.\nIn the men's individual event in biathlon, two silver medals were awarded for a second-place tie. No bronze medal was awarded for that event. Athletes from Slovakia (Anastasiya Kuzmina – biathlon, women's sprint) and Belarus (Aleksei Grishin – freestyle skiing, men's aerials) won the first Winter Olympic gold medals for their nations. Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen was the most successful athlete, winning three gold, one silver and one bronze medal, and became the ninth Winter Olympian to win five medals at one edition of the Games. Chinese short-track speed skater Wang Meng also won three gold medals.\nMedal leaders.\nAthletes that won at least two gold medals or at least three total medals are listed below."

        "title": "Rugby league in the British Isles",
        "text": "Rugby league is played across England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, but its heartland in parts of Northern England is where the sport is most popular, and is where the majority of professional clubs are based. The sport was first established in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, where 22 clubs split from the Rugby Football Union to form the Northern Rugby Football Union.\nRugby league in the British Isles is discussed in the following articles, corresponding to the separate organisations governing the sport:\nHowever, areas where the sport is similar between the Home Nations will be discussed in this article.\nHistory.\nRugby league was born in the British Isles, specifically at the George Hotel, Huddersfield in 1895 when the Northern Rugby Football Union broke away from the Rugby Football Union out of a desire to professionalise the game. This year gave birth to the first rugby league season where Manningham were crowned first ever Champions. However following this a national league would not be played until 1901 in favour of county's leagues. In 1897, the Challenge Cup was formed which saw Batley win the first ever cup title. 1902 saw the county's leagues split into two tiers which were now being played in addition to the national league.\nIn 1904, the first ever international game was played in Wigan in front of 6,000 fans which saw England lose to Other Nationalities 9–3. In 1906, rugby league became a 13-a-side sport.\nIn 1907, the 1907–08 New Zealand rugby tour of Australia and Great Britain became the first tour of Great Britain by a foreign national side. This tour marked the first game of rugby league in the capital which saw Great Britain lose to New Zealand 18–6 at Stamford Bridge in front of 14,000 fans.\n1921 saw the first £1,000 transfer of Harold Buck from Hunslet to Leeds.\nThe 1929 Challenge Cup Final was the first to be played at Wembley which saw Wigan beat Dewsbury 13–2 to lift their second Challenge Cup. Rugby League's first flood-lit game in 1932 was a friendly between Leeds and Wigan at White City Stadium in front of 10,000 people - Leeds won 18–9. In 1948, the first ever televised rugby league game was played. It was the 1948 Challenge Cup Final, which saw Wigan lift their third cup beating Bradford 8–3. The Rugby League International Federation was also formed this year in Bordeaux.\nThe 1949–50 Northern Rugby Football League season set the record for the highest total match day attendance in a season of 69.8 million - a record that still holds today. In 1954, at the 1954 Challenge Cup Final Replay, the record for the highest attended rugby league fixture was set at the Odsal Stadium with an official crowd of 102,569 watching Warrington claim an 8–4 victory over Halifax.\nIn 1954, the Rugby League World Cup was formed, 33 years ahead of the Rugby Union World Cup. The inaugural tournament was hosted in France and saw Great Britain beat the hosts in the final 16–12.\nThe 1960 Rugby League World Cup saw Great Britain as hosts for the first time. Great Britain won their second world cup title after losing out to Australia in the previous edition of the tournament.\nIn 1965, David Attenborough created the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy in order to promote the televising of rugby league. Four years later substitutes were permitted in matches, with the six-tackle rule being introduced in 1971. In 1972, Great Britain won their third, and most recent, world cup.\nIn 1976, the World Club Challenge was created which saw the league champions face Australia's league champions in what would become a yearly event. The inaugural competition saw Eastern Suburbs beat St Helens 25–2.\nIn 1981, Fulham R.L.F.C. formed from Fulham F.C. as part of its sporting family. They are currently the most successful team outside the heartlands. In 1983, yellow cards were introduced to the sport. Players receiving this card are subject to a 10-minute in game suspension. In 1991, the academy league was created in Great Britain.\nThe 1995 Rugby League World Cup marked the first time where Great Britain did not compete, instead competing as individual home nations of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.\n1996 saw the beginning of the Super League era where rugby league moved from a winter to summer sport. In 1998, the Super League Grand Final was created, reverting to a play-off system to decide the league champions. This marked the end of the longest period of time where the league leaders were crowned champions which had been in place since 1973. In 2003, the League Leaders' Shield was first awarded as a physical trophy, with the league leaders from 1998 to 2002 also being recognised for their achievement.\nIn 2002, London Skolars became the first community team in over 80 years to progress to the professional structure, with 2006 seeing Catalans Dragons join the league.\nIn 2007, Magic Weekend was introduced to the Super League, with the inaugural edition held at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. The event aiming to promote rugby league outside the heartlands. Following the 2007 season was the 2007 All Golds Tour which saw Great Britain compete for the final time - they won all three of their tour matches.\nThe 2013 Rugby League World Cup final at Old Trafford set the record for the largest attendance of an international rugby league game, with 74,468 people watching Australia beat New Zealand in the final.\n2016 saw promotion and relegation return to British rugby league as the controversial Super League licensing was scrapped. 2017 saw the first trans-atlantic side in Toronto Wolfpack enter the British rugby league system in League 1.\nThe 2017 Rugby League World Cup was the closest a British side had come to winning the competition since 1972, with England losing 6–0 to Australia in the final.\n2019 saw the return of Great Britain in the 2019 Great Britain Lions tour. The aim of the tour was to initiate a return for Great Britain to play competitively again, unfortunately they lost all four of their tour matches which caused people to question the feasibility of the team going forward.\nAugust 2020 marked the 125th anniversary of the birth of rugby league, which saw the opening of the National Rugby League Museum at its birthplace at the George Hotel, Huddersfield.\nSource: \nNational team.\nUnlike in most team sports in the United Kingdom, the UK has historically operated a unified national side, nicknamed the GB Lions, since 1908. The team saw great success, winning the 1954, 1960, and 1972 Rugby League World Cups in addition to achieving a runners up place on four separate occasions. However, the team did not enter the 1995 tournament in favour of England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland competing separately. Despite this, the GB Lions still competed in other tournaments together such as test series and the Rugby League Tri-Nations, until 2007 where the team was disbanded altogether.\nIn 2019, the GB Lions were reunited for a tour of the Pacific, playing against New Zealand (twice), Tonga, and Papua New Guinea. The presence of the tour gave hope for the home nations to compete under a unified team again. However the fact that Great Britain lost all four tour matches called people to question the feasibility of the team, with a major criticism being the imbalance in the number of English players to the other nationalities. This was defended with the justification of a lack of high level domestic league in Scotland, Wales, and Ireland.\nWomen's team.\nWomen's rugby league has also operated a full UK team nicknamed the GB Lionesses. Unlike the men's team, the women's team played in all competitions under the collective banner until the 2007 split in favour of the home nations competing individually. Before the split they competed in the inaugural 2000 Women's Rugby League World Cup, to which they were also hosts. The team came second, losing to New Zealand in the final. They also played the second world cup in 2003, which was their final major competition.\nDomestic competitions.\nLeague system.\nThe league system in Great Britain \nhas existed since 1895. Current the system operates a three-tier professional league system headed by the Super League, with the RFL Championship and RFL League 1 beneath the top tier. The professional structure is administered by the RFL, with BARLA administering the fourth tier National Conference League and Conference League South in addition to various fifth tier regional leagues. Three of these regional leagues, the North Wales Conference and the South Wales Premiership, and the Scottish National League are administered by Wales Rugby League and Scotland Rugby League respectively as teams that compete in them are exclusively part of the respective home nation. Despite this, they are also recognised as BARLA regional leagues in order to allow promotion to the conference leagues via the same method as the English regional leagues. The British rugby league system however doesn't include Northern Ireland who compete with Ireland on an all-Ireland basis. The Irish top tier of Rugby League is the Ireland National League.\nPopularity and team geography.\nDue to the increased popularity of rugby league in Yorkshire, Lancashire, and Cumbria compared to the rest of the country, the majority of the 36 professional teams to make up the top three tiers are from this area of the country. Of the 34 professional British teams, only six are not from the two historical counties (five English, and one Welsh). All of the professional clubs in the Super League are based in the North of England except from Catalans Dragons who are based in France. In the second tier Championship, London Broncos and Toulouse Olympique are the only clubs outside of Northern England. Newcastle Thunder despite being from the North of England, are not based in the rugby league heartlands. Finally, in the third tier League 1, Coventry Bears, London Skolars, and North Wales Crusaders are not from Northern England.\nThe increased popularity of Rugby League in its heartland of Yorkshire and Lancashire sees the National Conference League primarily operate in the heartlands and the Conference League South operate elsewhere. The National Conference League is split into four tiers to reflect its increased competitivity as teams in this league are primarily looking for promotion to the professional structure whereas teams in the Conference League South are usually looking for a greater standard of Rugby League than what exists in the regional league.\nDue to the popularity of Rugby League in the heartlands of Yorkshire and Lancashire, the term \"rugby\" usually refers to rugby league in those regions whereas \"rugby\" usually refers to rugby union in the rest of the British Isles. Occasionally, in the heartlands, \"football\" also refers to rugby league however this is rare due to football being the most popular sport in the country.\nIn terms of the general public, a 2005 report by MORI Sports Tracker reported that 15% of British over 15s had in interest in rugby league and 12% regularly viewed matches. These figures we're down from 20% and 15% respectively in their 1996 report.\nThe following is a list of average home attendance for Super League clubs during the league's first 25 years. The list does not take into account games played behind closed doors do the COVID-19 pandemic. Non-British clubs are denoted in \"italics\":\nCup competitions.\nThe Challenge Cup is the national cup of Rugby League in the United Kingdom. The competition is administered by the RFL and was instituted in 1896. The competition has also seen teams from Ireland, France, Canada, Russia and Serbia compete.\nThe 1895 Cup also exists for teams competing in the Championship and League 1.\nWomen's rugby.\nIn 2012 the Women's Challenge Cup played its inaugural edition becoming the first major women's rugby league competition and is administered by the RFL. The RFL also administer the Women's Super League, the top tier of women's rugby league introduced in 2017 replacing the RFL Women's Rugby League which started in 2014. In 2021, in an attempt to expand women's rugby league, the Women's Super League South as a new top-tier competition. While the Super League South is officially a top-tier competition, participants are not eligible for the Grand Final.\nDefunct competitions.\nThere have been a number of rugby league competitions played in the British Isles during its history. The current Super League is the direct successor to the Rugby Football League Championship First Division during its rebrand in 1996, with the Second Division, and Third Division being rebranded to the Championship and League 1 respectively in 2003.\nThe 1895 Cup (2019–present) has also existed under different names at different points in history. Once as the Trans-Pennine Cup (1998–2001), as the Championship Cup (2002–2013), and again as the League 1 Cup (2015–2017).\nThe League Cup (1972–1996) and Charity Shield (1985–1996) have also existed for short periods of time and operated in the same way as the English football competitions of the same name. The League Cup being a cup for professional clubs only, and the Charity Shield a single game competition to mark the start of the season between the previous years league champions and challenge cup winners.\nThe county competitions in Lancashire and Yorkshire were historically a major part of rugby league in the British Isles. The RFL Lancashire League and RFL Yorkshire League are as old as the national league itself and the RFL Lancashire Cup and RFL Yorkshire Cup were founded only a decade after the Challenge Cup. The county league were abandoned in 1970 and the cups in 1996 in order to develop rugby league nationally. The Rugby League War of the Roses was the only county competition to survive into the Super League era, being abandoned in 2003. The competition was a single game event featuring one team from each county and was based on the roses rivalry that has existed between the two counties since the Wars of the Roses which ended in 1487. For most of its history the Roses Match was played as part of the County Championship.\nGoverning bodies.\nMen's governance.\nThe Rugby Football League (RFL) was the governing body for rugby league in the British Isles until the founding of Rugby League Ireland, Scotland Rugby League, Wales Rugby League, and in 1988, 1994, and 1995 respectively. Currently, the RFL has full control over Rugby League in England only with the other organisations operating within their respective home nation. However, the RFL has powers over the North Wales Crusaders as the RFL are the sole governors of the professional league system.\nAll four bodies are affiliated with the International Rugby League (IRL) and the European Rugby League (ERL), and government their own national teams with the RFL, Wales Rugby League, and Scotland Rugby League jointly operating the Great Britain national rugby league team.\nThe British Amateur Rugby League Association (BARLA) are responsible for amateur rugby league chiefly in the sport's North of England heartlands. Though many National Conference League and Conference League South teams are affiliated to BARLA, the Conference itself is not a BARLA organisation. As well as the conferences, BARLA overseas a number of regional leagues, mostly located in the heartlands, but also including the North Wales Conference and the South Wales Premiership, and the Scottish National League which are administered by Wales Rugby League and Scotland Rugby League respectively but also see BARLA involvement in order to allow promotion to the conferences.\nBARLA are also responsible for selecting an international team consisting of amateur players, the BARLA Lions. This team tours many parts of the rugby league world, and have competed in the Rugby League Emerging Nations Tournament.\nWomen's rugby.\nThe Women's Amateur Rugby League Association (WARLA) was the governing body of female rugby league in the British Isles from its established in 1985. It was recognised by the RFL in its first year. In 2013 WARLA became fully incorporated into the Rugby Football League which now runs the top tiers of the women's game.\nArmed forces.\nRugby league was recognised as a military sport in 1994. The Combined Services Rugby League (CSRL) is the co-ordinating group for the British Army Rugby League, Royal Navy Rugby League and Royal Air Force Rugby League. Each constituent body organises its own competitions at unit and formation level. Players are fed into representative teams to represent each of the services, and the best players are selected to represent the Combined Services. Because of the difference in sovereignty between the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland, it is the only place where Northern Ireland competes in rugby league under a UK system rather than an all-Ireland one. Great Britain Police also have their own rugby league team which, along with those if the armed forces, regularly competes in the Challenge Cup.\nStudent rugby.\nThe British Universities and Colleges Sport run The University and College Rugby League and govern rugby league at the university level. The Champion Schools is the top-level competition for secondary school children in Great Britain.\nRivalries.\nClub.\nThere are a number of rivalries within professional rugby in the British Isles, with debate about which one is the biggest. The Hull derby between Hull F.C. and Hull KR is the only derby where both participants are from the same city. The Good Friday derby is also considered a major rivalry with the two teams, Wigan Warriors and St Helens, consistently performing well in the league and cup competitions. Other major rivalries include the Calder derby, Cheshire derby, and West Yorkshire derby.\nAdditionally, there is a four-way rivalry between the so-called Super League Big Four. These four team are usually contain the champion of every season, both in the Super League and Challenge Cup. The Big Four consists of Wigan Warriors, St Helens, Leeds Rhinos, and Warrington Wolves. Prior to 2010, Bradford Bulls was considered a Big Four member, before the rise of Warrington, the club has since dropped in performance level and now plays in the Championship.\nCounty.\nLancashire and Yorkshire have always shared a rivalry due to the War of the Roses. This rivalry has naturally seeped into rugby league to which they completed in a competition of the same name until 2003. The rivalry is also seen when clubs from both counties face each other in competitive and non-competitive matches.\nInternational.\nEngland (previously Great Britain as a whole) is main rival is with Australia, with whom they compete in The Ashes. This rivalry has also affected the domestic game with the Super League and National Rugby League becoming the two biggest club competitions on the planet with the two competition winners competing in the World Club Challenge. England (and Great Britain) also share a rivalry with New Zealand to whom they also have contested many tours.\nEngland and Wales also share a three way rivalry with France through the Rugby League European Championship – the traditional big three European teams.\nTelevision rights.\nLive Super League and National Rugby League games are shown on Sky Sports Arena with highlights also being shown on the channel. On Monday evenings, during the UK domestic season, the \"Super League Show\" is broadcast in the BBC regions of North East and Cumbria, North West, Yorkshire, and Yorkshire and Lincolnshire which shows highlights of the weekend's matches. There is a nation repeat on Tuesday lunchtime. From the 2022 season, 10 live Super League games per season will be shown on Channel 4, the first time the league will be shown on terrestrial television. Championship games are shown on Premier Sports, with one game a week being aird.\nChallenge Cup matches are shown on BBC Sport. The final and semi-finals are shown usually on BBC One. Matches prior to the sixth round are usually shown on BBC Red Button or as BBC iPlayer exclusives. BBC Two is also used in addition to BBC One to show the matches from the latter stages of competition.\nThe BBC started airing the Challenge Cup Final regularly from 1958 and lower rounds from 1960. The final was also broadcast as a one-off in 1948 and 1952. Sky Sports began covering league matches from the 1990–91 season. For a dealied summary of summer era coverage from 1996 onwards, see the below table:\nStadiums.\nIreland is the only home nation to have a national rugby league stadium, two in fact, with Irish home matches being played at Carlisle Grounds and Morton Stadium. England, Scotland, and Wales also don't have set home grounds. Elland Road has been the most recent home venue for England, Netherdale for Scotland, and the Racecourse Ground for Wales.\nDomestically, Old Trafford is used as the venue of the Super League Grand Final, with Wembley Stadium hosting the Challenge Cup Final. Super League's Magic Weekend has previously been hosted at the Millennium Stadium, Murrayfield, Etihad Stadium, St James' Park, and Anfield.\nThe MKM Stadium, home of Hull F.C., is the largest club venue in the British Isles. The stadium was also used to host the 2020 Super League Grand Final as Old Trafford couldn't accommodate that year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Following this, the DW Stadium, Kirklees Stadium, Odsal Stadium, and Headingley are the only other club venues to have a capacity greater than 20,000.\nMuseums.\nThe UK's National Rugby League Museum opened in August 2020 in the George Hotel, Huddersfield, Yorkshire, the birthplace of rugby league, on the sport's 125th anniversary."

        "text": "A flat shot in tennis is made by striking the ball at a neutral level. Unlike the backspin and topspin the ball is hit with a swipe at neutral level. This effect is created by driving through the ball to push it forward rather than brushing up or down the back creating spin. The shot is commonly used for power and helps quicken the pace on the ball during play.\nUses of the Flat Shot.\nFlat shots have many applications in tennis, particularly on the serve.\nThe flat serve is most often used for a first serve, due to its speed and little room for error. Most flat serves fly straight through the air and bounce relatively medium-low in comparison to other types of serves. They are characterized by their speed and placement. A good flat serve should be aimed along the center of the court, where the net is lowest, in order to maximize chances of landing the serve. Although the placement of this serve is generally the same, its speed at arrival is often used to generate aces or service winners. Many professional players utilize strong flat serves, such as Robin Söderling and Andy Roddick."

The Federation Tournament of Champions returned to Glens Falls at the Glens Falls Civic Center beginning in March 2017.\nEarly history.\nThe earliest high school boys' state championship in New York was held in 1921 as a single-class tournament. The tournament continued as a one-classification competition through 1929, then as a two-classification (A and B) competition from 1930 through 1932. After the 1932 tournament, the NYSPHSAA voted against continuing the competition. According to Alton Doyle, the executive director of the NYSPHSAA from 1975 to 1990, there were many violations of the rules on eligibility, with some schools using overage students, and gambling was widespread. The state tournament was believed to be a cause of such problems, leading to the decision to eliminate the tournament.\nRegional tournaments continued over the years without any overall state championship. From 1974 through 1977, various inter-sectional, regional and inter-class post-season tournaments were held. In 1976, the state legislature passed a bill to authorize a state tournament, which began in 1978.\nSections and classifications.\nWinners of each section compete in the NYSPHSAA tournament, by size classification, for the NYSPHSAA state championship. There are 11 sections, as follows:\nEach section is further divided into classes, by school enrollment size. The classes are, from largest schools to smallest, AA, A, B, C, and D. For 2015, the classification enrollment cutoffs were as follows, counting the number of 9th, 10th and 11th grade students in the previous scholastic year (enrollment is doubled for all-boys schools):\nA school may elect to play in a higher classification, but may not elect to play in a lower classification.\nWinners and runners-up.\nWinners and runners-up of the single-classification tournament from 1921 through 1929 were:\nWinners and runners-up of the two-classification tournament from 1930 through 1932 were:\nVenues of the current, multi-classification tournament:\nResults of the current, multi-classification tournament, through 2019:\nChampionships by school.\nResults through 2020:\nChampionships by section.\nResults through 2020:"

It was held at Gotham Hall in New York City. Thirteen teams representing their countries competed for a total of $130,000 USD in prize money.\nFormat.\nTeams consist of two members. One member competes using a QWERTY keyboard, while the other member uses a numeric keypad. Thirteen countries participated in the 2010 competition: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Indonesia, Mexico, New Zealand, Portugal, Russia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, and the United States.\nPreviously, LG hosted texting competitions in individual countries such as the United States and South Korea. The United States had competitions for 2007, 2008, and 2009. South Korea had competitions in 2008 and 2009. However, 2010 was the first year when countries competed against each other.\nQualification.\nTeams earned the right to participate in regional qualifiers. Over six million people registered to compete in the tournament.\nEach team participated in five separate events: \"break the wall\", \"monster popping\", \"moving pillar\", \"running relay\", and \"racing replay\". The basic premise was to copy a scrolling piece of text as quickly as possible. No errors were allowed in transcription. All of the text messages were in the native language of the participants, but had the same number of characters in order to ensure fairness. Additionally, all participants had to use the LG enV3, LG BL20 or LG GW520\nResults.\nHa Mok-min, aged 16, and her partner, 17-year-old Bae Yeong-ho, won first prize in the competition. Mok-min won the national championship, and was able to text at an average of 7.25 characters per second. She signed up for the competition when she noticed a kiosk in the mall, and saw the opportunity to win free movie tickets. Yeong-ho, a high school dropout, signed up in order to obtain money to buy a new car. The second-place finishers were Kate Moore and Morgan Dynda from the United States. The third place team was from Argentina (Agustina Montegna and Juan Ignacio Aufranc)\nThe prizes were set at US$100,000 per pair for first place, $20,000 per pair for second place and $10,000 per pair for third place.\nRecords.\nA side competition was offered to see who could beat the Guinness Book of World Records record for fastest text message sent. This record was broken by Pedro Matias from Portugal. He typed a 264-character text message in 1:59. The record for fastest keystrokes per minute on a numeric keyboard was set by Indonesia at 306, while the most keystrokes per minute record on a QWERTY keyboard was set by South Korea at 357."

        "title": "Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey",
        "text": "The Colgate Raiders women's ice hockey team is an NCAA Division I ice hockey team that represents Colgate University and play in ECAC Hockey. The Raiders play their home games at Class of 1965 Arena. The Raiders have played in Division I hockey since the 2001–02 season after playing at the NCAA Division III from 1997 to 2001.\nHistory.\n1973–1983: The early years.\nFrom 1973 to 1974, Colgate Women's hockey started as an intramural team. Despite interest from the players in making the team varsity, the Athletic Director said the team would require \"sustained interest.\" In 1974, Colgate Women's Hockey became club team. For the players from 1974 to 1983, 57% had never played on a team before Colgate women's hockey. 92% had never played hockey before, and 62% started by playing on figure skates, using masking tape over the toe picks. Many pieces of equipment and uniforms were \"hand me downs\" from the men's team. Players had to purchase their own sticks, skates and jerseys. The women's team practiced when ice time was available, which was usually late, after intramural games were completed, usually at 10 p.m.. Damp, smelly pads would be passed from intramural players to the women – given a brief spray of sanitizer by the student intramural equipment minder during the transfer.\nDuring these years, the team played other colleges up and down the east coast, including Cornell, St. Lawrence, Oswego and Ithaca. The team played at Middlebury and Williams, but since they didn't have hockey rinks, they played in a curling rink. Whether checking would be allowed was determined before the game by the coaches. If a team didn't have pads for each suited player, there was no checking.\nOne memorable game in the early years included an 18–1 loss to Cornell, during which the Colgate goalie stopped 72 shots.\nIn the early years, players travelled to games in their own cars or used university vans, which they had to drive themselves. With no funding for transportation and accommodations, the players would often try to play near where some of the players lived and stayed at the player's family's house. For many games, players had to call around to find out who could make the game, what positions they could play and if they had a jersey.\nCoaching the team was a volunteer job, and it was an unpaid and time-consuming one, so it was often difficult for the team to find coaches. One of Colgate women's hockey's first coaches was Mike Milbury.\nCook v. Colgate University.\nIn 1993, the Colgate Women's Hockey Team was granted varsity status after a decision from the United States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit.\nColgate University appealed an original judgment entered in the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, ordering it to elevate its women's club ice hockey team to varsity status and to provide equal funding and benefits to its men's and women's ice hockey programs. The plaintiffs were Jennifer Baldwin Cook, Melissa Ehlers, Christine Price, Thayer Jaques and Julie Wolff, who were all either current or former Colgate students and former members of Colgate's women's club ice hockey team. Frustrated by Colgate's continued reluctance to elevate the program to varsity status, the plaintiffs filed in court on April 10, 1990, alleging that Colgate's failure to provide a comparable ice hockey program to men and women students violated Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688 (1990), the regulations of the Department of Education, as well as the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution. For its part, Colgate denied any discrimination and argued that its compliance with the mandates of Title IX should be measured by its overall athletic program, not by a sport-by-sport comparison. Ultimately, Cook et al., won the judgement.\n1997–2001.\nColgate women's hockey went varsity in 1997. The team was initially Division III but transitioned to Division I in 2001.\n2001–11.\nIn 2008-2009, Kimberly Sass set a school record for most wins in a season by a goaltender with 14 games. Sass finished the season as one of the top ranked goalies in the ECAC. Her .941 save percentage was first in the ECAC. Her 1.85 goals against average was sixth while her .656 win percentage was fourth. From October 7–8, 2011: In a pair of victories over the Lindenwood Lions, Brittany Phillips accumulated a total of 10 points. In the 7–2 victory on October 7, she notched two goals, while logging an assist. One of the goals was the game-winning goal.\nThe following day, she had seven points (two goals, five assists) in an 8–2 win. Of the four goals she scored, two were power play goals. Her seven points ranked second in program history for most points in one game. The five assists ranked second for most assists in one game. In addition, Melissa Kueber registered six points in the sweep. On October 8, she led the team with four goals scored in an 8–2 triumph over the Lions. She also notched an assist. The four tallies tied for first in program history for most scores in one game.\n2012–present.\nGreg Fargo began as head coach in the 2012-2013 season. Prior to coaching at Colgate, he was head coach for the women's ice hockey team at Elmira, in NCAA Division III, for four seasons. Fargo played his college hockey career as a goaltender, at Elmira.\nIn 2015-2016, Colgate had its first 22 win season, setting a program record.\nColgate had its most successful year in program history during the 2017–18 season. The Raiders finished 34–6–1, setting a new program record for wins. They finished tied with Clarkson for first in the ECAC conference, with a 19–3 (.864) record, earning their first ECAC league title. They qualified for the NCAA tournament for the first time, and advanced to the championship game after beating Northeastern in the quarterfinals by a score of 3–1, and Wisconsin in the semi-finals in a 4–3 victory.\nThe championship game against conference rival Clarkson was a close contest. Clarkson scored first, at 16:29 in the opening period, on a goal by forward Cassidy Vinkle, assisted by Kelly Mariani. It was the only goal Colgate goalie Julia Vandyk allowed in regulation. Colgate tied the score at 2:27 in the second period, on an equalizer by Malia Schneider, her 16th of the season, with assists from Olivia Zafuto and Bre Wilson-Bennett. The teams went scoreless in the third period and ended regulation at 1–1. At 7:55 in the first overtime, Elizabeth Giguere scored the game-winner, to give Clarkson the national championship. Finishing as national runner-up, the season saw the highest finish for the Raiders in Colgate program history. Head coach Greg Fargo won the 2017–18 Division I AHCA Coach of the Year award, given by the American Hockey Coaches Association.\nRoster.\n2022–23 Raiders.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

Another college teammate, Earl Lloyd, was the first black person to play in an NBA game.\nNunn was recruited by the Harlem Globetrotters, but chose instead to return home to Pittsburgh to work at the Courier.\nJournalism.\nNunn started as a sportswriter at the \"Courier\", and eventually moved up to become the sports editor and then managing editor in the mid-1960s after his father's retirement.\nScouting career.\nAs a sportswriter for a black publication, Nunn developed deep knowledge of football programs at historically black colleges and universities. The Courier named a \"Black College All-America\" team starting in 1950. The NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers noted Nunn's coverage of these players who were traditionally under-represented in the league and in Nunn accepted a part-time position on team's scouting staff. The sideline became a full-time position two years later when Chuck Noll became the team's coach.\nNunn is most noted for scouting players such as Mel Blount, John Stallworth, Donnie Shell and Sam Davis from historically black colleges and universities (HBCU) who played integral roles in the Steelers' four Super Bowl championships during the 1970s. In the case of Stallworth, scouts from various NFL teams observed him run the 40-yard dash on a wet track at Alabama A&amp;M University and were disappointed by the results. Nunn was the only scout to stay an additional day and watched Stallworth run a better time on a dry track. Nunn also had obtained the only college game film of Stallworth that existed through his relationships with HBCU coaches, and it was alleged that he withheld it from other NFL teams.\nPersonal.\nNunn lived with his wife, Frances, in the Schenley Heights neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Their son Bill was an actor; he played Radio Raheem in \"Do The Right Thing\". Because of his son's fame, the elder Nunn referred to himself as Bill Nunn Sr. Their daughter, Lynell Wilson, is a former U.S. Attorney.\nNunn died on May 6, 2014, at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, two weeks after suffering a stroke. Burial was at Homewood Cemetery, Pittsburgh. Posthumously in 2021, Bill Nunn was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio as a contributor. As a Steelers Scout, 13 of his players who were drafted were also enshrined in the Hall of Fame.\nThe Bill Nunn Award.\nPer the Pro Football Hall of Fame:\n\"The Bill Nunn Memorial Award is presented annually by the Professional Football Writers of America in recognition of long and distinguished reporting in the field of pro football. The award, which originated in 1969, was renamed in 2021 in tribute to Nunn, a longtime writer and editor at the Pittsburgh Courier.\nIn addition to his esteemed career in journalism, Nunn worked for roughly half a century in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ scouting department. In 2021, he became the first African American elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in the Contributor category.\""

        "text": "Washington Trust Field and Patterson Baseball Complex is a college baseball park in the northwest United States, located on the campus of Gonzaga University on Spokane, Washington. Opened in 2007, it is the home venue of the Gonzaga Bulldogs of the West Coast Conference (WCC).\nDesigned by architect ALSC Architects, Washington Trust Field and Patterson Baseball Complex has 1,300 fixed seats in the main seating bowl and a total capacity of 2,300. The complex includes field lighting, home and visitors locker rooms, baseball offices, laundry, training and equipment facilities, batting cages, a natural grass field, modern restrooms and concession stands for the convenience of the fans, and an electronic information board and a stone marker welcoming visitors. The playing field is aligned southeast at an elevation just under above sea level; the site was formerly an annex of the U.S. Postal Service.\nPatterson Baseball Complex is named after the family of Michael Patterson (class of 1969), chairman of Gonzaga's Board of Trustees and a major contributor to the project. Washington Trust Field is named after Washington Trust Bank in which, Pete Stanton, the chairman and CEO of Washington Trust Bank, and Jack Heath, president of Washington Trust Bank, were the major forces behind the field naming.\nThe Bulldogs played on campus from 1968 through 2003 at August/ART Stadium (Pecarovich Field until 1996), which was displaced by the construction of McCarthey Athletic Center, home of the Gonzaga basketball teams. After ground was broken for McCarthey in April 2003, the baseball team finished the season at Spokane Falls Community College, then played three seasons in Spokane's minor league venue, Avista Stadium.\nA few hundred yards south of the old field, ground was broken for the facility in June 2006, and it opened nine months later on March 15, 2007, a victory over Rider University. The first night game was played April 17, a loss to the dedication game was three nights later, a conference victory over Saint Mary's."

        "text": "The Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's lacrosse team represents the University of Notre Dame in NCAA Division I men's college lacrosse. Notre Dame competes as a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference and plays its home games at Arlotta Family Lacrosse Stadium or the indoor Loftus Sports Center before it is warm enough outside each season, in Notre Dame, Indiana.\nHistory.\nNotre Dame men's lacrosse was a club sport, started by Jack Tate ND '64, until it became a varsity program in the 1981 season. Former Notre Dame Athletic Director Jack Swarbrick was a midfielder on Notre Dame's club lacrosse team during his undergraduate years (1972–76) before the team acquired varsity status. In their 17 seasons as a club ('64-'80), the Irish compiled a 114-91 record with wins over Ohio State, Michigan, Denver, Air Force and Georgetown. From 1981 to 1993, Notre Dame competed in the Midwest Lacrosse Association. From 1994 to 2009, it was then a member of the Great Western Lacrosse League. In 2010, it became a member of the newly established Big East men's lacrosse conference. In 2012, Notre Dame announced that it would be joining the Atlantic Coast Conference. From 1981 to 1988, the program was led by head coach Rich O'Leary, who established a career record of 64–42 (.604), after which Kevin Corrigan took over as head coach, beginning in 1989. Within ten years as a varsity program, the Fighting Irish made its first appearance in the NCAA championship tournament in 1990, and since then has regularly appeared there. In 2001, the fifth-seeded Irish reached the semi-final round (Final Four) for the first time after defeating Bucknell 12–7 and fourth-seeded Johns Hopkins 13–9 in earlier rounds, and finished the season with a 14–2 record and a #4 ranking in the nation.\nSince 2006, Notre Dame has made the NCAA championship tournament every year except 2022. In 2009, the Irish went undefeated in the regular season, reaching #2 in national polls, and finished with an overall record of 15–1, with five players receiving All-America honors. In the fall of 2009, Notre Dame opened its new lacrosse-specific outdoor stadium, Arlotta Stadium, with 2,500 seats, an artificial turf field, locker rooms, restrooms, and concession areas. In 2010, the Irish began play in the new Big East men's lacrosse conference and went 7–6 in the regular season before advancing to the NCAA tournament as an unseeded selection, where it upset higher seeds Princeton, Maryland, and Cornell before being defeated by fifth-seeded Duke, 6–5 in overtime of the championship game. In 2011, Notre Dame went 10–2 in the regular season, reaching #1 in national polls, and advanced to the quarterfinal round of the NCAA tournament before losing to Duke, 7–5. In 2012, the Irish went 13–3, defeating ranked opponents Duke, Denver, Syracuse, and defending national champion Virginia before losing to the number one seed and eventual national champion Loyola 7–5 in the semi-final round of the NCAA Tournament. In 2013, the Irish finished with an 11–5 record and advanced to the quarterfinal round of the tournament, losing to eventual champion Duke, 12–11.\nNotre Dame won the 2023 NCAA National Championship. They defeated Duke 13-9 with Senior goalie Liam Entenmann making 18 saves. They went 10-2 in the regular season and were awarded the three seed in the NCAA tournament. They defeated Utah in the first round of the playoffs, Johns Hopkins in the quarter-finals, and Virginia in the semi-finals before defeating Duke.\nIn the history of the program, Notre Dame has produced numerous All-Americans: Mike Iorio (1993, 1994, 1995); Randy Colley (1994, 1995); Todd Rassas (1996, 1997, 1998); Alex Cade (1996); Jimmy Keenan (1996, 1997, 1998); Chris Dusseau (1999); Tom Glatzel (2000, 2001); David Ulrich (2000, 2001); Kirk Howell (2001); Steve Bishko (2001); Mike Adams (2001); AJ Wright (2002); Pat Walsh (2003, 2004, 2005); DJ Driscoll (2005, 2006); Joey Kemp (2006, 2007, 2008); Brian Hubschmann (2007); Sean Dougherty (2007, 2008); Michael Podgajny (2007, 2008); Will Yeatman (2007); Ryan Hoff (2008, 2009); Regis McDermott (2009); Sam Barnes (2009); Grant Krebs (2009, 2010); Scott Rodgers (2009, 2010); Zach Brenneman (2010, 2011); David Earl (2010, 2011); Kevin Ridgway (2010, 2011); Sam Barnes (2011), Andrew Irving (2011), John Kemp (2011, 2012, 2013), Kevin Randall (2012), Jim Marlatt (2012, 2013), Matt Miller (2012, 2013), and Matt Kavanagh (2013, 2014).\nIn addition, several Notre Dame players have been Tewaaraton Trophy nominees: Tom Glatzel (2001), David Ulrich (2001), Pat Walsh (2004, 2005), Joey Kemp (2008), Scott Rodgers (2009, 2010), Grant Krebs (2010), David Earl (2011), Kevin Ridgway (2011), John Kemp (2012, 2013), Matt Landis (2016), and Pat Kavanagh (2021, 2023)\nUnder current coach Kevin Corrigan, the Irish have an overall record of 241–114 (.679) through the 2013 season. The program has a 100% graduation rate since it was started in 1981. Corrigan has been selected as the GWLL Coach of the Year fives times, including in 2009, which was the conference's final season before the establishment of the Big East men's lacrosse conference.\nAt the beginning of its games, the Irish team is traditionally led onto the playing field by a teammate playing the bagpipes, a tradition that was begun during the 1996 season by then-freshman Sean Meehan and has since been passed down to other players including Chad DeBolt, Daniel Hickey, Regis McDermott, Colt Power, Ryan Mix, Edwin Glazener, Tommy McNamara, Ross Burgmaster and Brian Tevlin.\nSeason Results.\nThe following is a list of Notre Dame's results by season as an NCAA Division I program:"

        "text": "The University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish and University of California, Los Angeles Bruins have a rivalry in men's basketball. They also play occasionally in football.\nSeries history.\nUCLA had a basketball rivalry with Notre Dame that started when Digger Phelps was the Notre Dame coach and John Wooden was the UCLA coach. UCLA and Notre Dame played a home-and-home meeting for several seasons in the 1970s and 1980s, which is otherwise uncommon outside conference play. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, the schools met once annually. This rivalry existed from the desire of the Notre Dame athletic department to schedule the top schools for intersectional competition, much as the Notre Dame–USC football rivalry. UCLA and Notre Dame played 42 times between 1966 and 1995, and the height of the rivalry was when Notre Dame ended UCLA's consecutive game winning streak at 88 on January 19, 1974. UCLA also broke a 60-game Notre Dame winning streak in South Bend.\nFormer UCLA head coach Ben Howland had since scheduled Notre Dame four times: in 2004, 2005, 2008, and 2009. Through the 2019-20 season, UCLA leads the all-time series 29–21."

        "title": "Australian Rowing Championships",
        "text": "The Australian Rowing Championships is an annual rowing event that determines Australia's national rowing champions and facilitates selection of Australian representative crews for World Championships and the Olympic Games. It is Australia's premier regatta, with states, clubs and schools sending their best crews. The Championships commence with the National Regatta - men's, women's and lightweight events in open, under 23, under 19, under 17 and school age events. Rowers at the National Regatta race in their local club colours with composite crews permitted. The Championships conclude with the Interstate Regatta - currently eight events competed by state representative crews or scullers selected by the state rowing associations. The states compete for an overall points tally which decides the Zurich Cup.\nCompetition history.\nInter-colonial racing began in Australia in 1833 when a Sydney crew raced a Hobart crew in whalers. Schools, varsity and club events were the top-class races throughout the mid 19th century although New South Wales and Victoria raced regularly (though not annually) in men's IVs from 1863. In 1878 Victoria and New South Wales commenced inter-colonial racing in eight-oared boats and the other colonies and (later states) joined them such that by 1906 all six Australian states were sending a men's VIII and perhaps a sculler, to the annual Interstate Regatta.\nA national open rowing championship was discussed at Australian Rowing Council meetings from 1946 but it wasn't until the 1960s that support for the concept was unanimous outside of New South Wales and Victoria. The first National Open Championship Regatta was held in 1962 and then was held every two years. Since 1969 the National Regatta has been annual and since 1976 has been held within the same single programme as the Interstate Regatta creating the combined Australian Rowing Championships.\nInterstate Regatta.\nThe Interstate Regatta is held at the conclusion of the National Regatta and currently includes the following races for state representative crews:\nThe King's Cup - Interstate Men's Eight.\nAustralia's blue-ribbon annual rowing race for men. Contested by state representative senior heavyweight men's eights.\nThe President's Cup - Interstate Men's Single Scull.\nAn intercolonial sculling race between New South Wales and Victoria was first held in 1868 and then annually from 1895 with Queensland also racing. Tasmania has consistently been represented since 1903. South Australia and West Australia have entered scullers with some regularity but not consistently until the 1960s.\nThe first President of the Australian Amateur Rowing Council, Mr E.C. Watchorn, donated the President's Cup in 1925 as the perpetual trophy for the annual Australian Interstate Single Sculling Championship. It was first competed for in 1926 and won by A A Baynes of Queensland.\nThe Queen Elizabeth II Cup - Interstate Women's Eight.\nThe premier interstate event for women was the ULVA trophy which from 1920 till 1998 was a fours event. The trophy had first been presented by the United Licensed Victuallers Association (ULVA) of Queensland. In 1999 the women's interstate race was changed to an event for VIIIs with the Queen's Cup as the prize.\nOf the seventy-eight occasions between 1920 and 1999 that the race was held in IVs, New South Wales won thirty-one times with eleven of those victories consecutive between 1955 and 1965. Victoria managed twenty-four victories in that period also with eleven of them consecutive (1978–1988) and then enjoying another eleven year consecutive run from 2005 to 2015. Of the twenty-five events up until 2015, Victoria were the victors on eighteen occasions.\nThe Penrith Cup - Interstate Men's Lightweight Coxless Four.\nThe Penrith Cup for a lightweight men's IV was introduced in 1958.\nThe Nell Slatter Trophy - Interstate Women's Single Scull.\nSince 1963 the interstate women's scull competition has been for the Nell Slatter Trophy.\nThe Victoria Cup - Interstate Women's Lightweight Coxless Quad Scull.\nFrom 1968 until 1998 the premier women's lightweight interstate event was the Victoria Cup competed for by coxless IVs. Since 1999, lightweight quad sculls have raced for the Cup.\nThe Noel Wilkinson Trophy - Interstate Men's Youth Eight.\nSince 1974 men's youth crews have competed at the state representative level for the Noel Wilkinson Cup. Noel Wilkinson (died 1992) OAM was a long serving treasurer of the Australian Rowing Council who had worked tirelessly in fund-raising over many years for Australian national and Olympic squads. He had managed Victorian and national representative crews and was a club stalwart at the Banks Rowing Club in Melbourne from 1930 till his death. The event has been raced over 2000 metres since 1983. In the first thirty-seven years of competition for the title up till 2011, Victoria were the most consistent winners with seventeen wins, followed by New South Wales with ten victories.\nThe Bicentennial Cup - Interstate Women's Youth Eight.\nA women's youth event commenced in 1988 in coxed IVs and converted to VIIIs in 1994.\nThe Zurich Cup - Overall Regatta Points Tally.\nSince 1999 the overall cumulative points winner in the interstate championships is awarded the Zurich Cup. States are awarded points in each interstate event on the following basis: first place, eight points; second place, six points; third place, five points; fourth place, four points; fifth place, three points; sixth place, two points; seventh place, one point.\nIn the sixteen regattas at which it was presented up till 2014, the Zurich Cup was won on eleven occasions by Victoria, thrice by New South Wales and by Queensland in 2003 and 2014.\nThe National Regatta.\nThe National Regatta currently includes a diverse program of club and school events.\nThe Sydney Cup - Schoolgirl Eights.\nThe Sydney Cup was first presented in 2005. The current title holders are Melbourne Girls' Grammar.\nThe Barrington Cup - Schoolboy Eights.\nThe Barrington Cup was first presented in 1984. The current title holders are St Ignatius.\nLocations and events.\nInterstate Men's Championships for VIIIs (Kings Cup) and single sculls (Presidents Cup) were held in the following locations after Federation:\nThe Penrith Cup for lightweight fours was added to the Kings Cup and Presidents Cup at Interstate Men's Championships for VIIIs as follows:\nAn Interstate Women's Race for the ULVA Trophy was held in the following locations:\nWith the Nell Slatter Trophy for women's single sculls added to the Women's Interstate Regatta from 1963 and the Victoria Cup added from 1968:\nInterstate Championships with both Men's and Women's events were held in the following locations:\nA separate National Regatta was held with distinct dates and venue from the Interstate Championships as follows:\nAustralian Rowing Championships (combining both regattas) have been held in the following locations"

The first was Australian Tom Horan, who dismissed Walter Read with his first ball on 26 January 1883, and the most recent is South African bowler Tshepo Moreki who took the wicket of Devon Conway on 4 February 2024. However, this accomplishment has not always led to a long and illustrious career. Only Maurice Tate, Keith Miller, Intikhab Alam and Nathan Lyon went on to play in more than ten Tests. Arthur Coningham, Matt Henderson, Dennis Smith, and Tyrell Johnson were One-Test wonders, and Smith's only Test wicket was the one he took with his first ball.\nIn One Day International (ODI) matches, 31 bowlers have taken a wicket with their first ball. The first to accomplish this was English bowler Geoff Arnold, who bowled Graeme Watson on 24 August 1972. Not all of these bowlers took their first wicket in their debut match. Clive Lloyd, Inzamam-ul-Haq, Sadagoppan Ramesh, and Martin van Jaarsveld did not bowl in their debut matches, and took their first wicket on a later appearance. Ramesh and Wavell Hinds took their first wickets during the same match on 6 September 1999; the former in the first innings of the match and the latter in the second. It was also the only wicket taken by Ramesh during his ODI career.\nIn Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket, 29 bowlers have taken a wicket with their first ball, including three women. The first to achieve this feat was Australian Michael Kasprowicz who took wickets with his first and second delivery in this format on 17 May 2005, dismissing New Zealand's Stephen Fleming and Mathew Sinclair.

        "title": "South Florida Bulls men's basketball",
        "text": "The South Florida Bulls men's basketball team represents the University of South Florida in NCAA Division I basketball competition, where they are currently a member of the American Athletic Conference. They are currently led by head coach Amir Abdur-Rahim, who was hired after Brian Gregory was fired following the 2022–23 season. The Bulls play their home games at the 10,500 seat Yuengling Center on USF's campus in Tampa, Florida. USF has won two conference championships and has reached the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament 3 times in their history (1990, 1992, and 2012), with their best finish coming in 2012 when they made the round of 32.\nHistory.\nTesting (1970–71).\nBefore men's basketball became an official sport at USF, Athletic Director Dick Bowers and President John S. Allen approved of a freshman only squad to test the feasibility of bringing men's basketball to the University of South Florida. They played against freshman teams from other universities in the state as well as junior colleges. The team was a roaring success and won in their first ever game on December 4, 1970, against the University of Florida. The 1970–71 team finished with a 19–4 record and their popularity led to the approval of the varsity team. The 1970 USF basketball team is not listed the team media guide and 1971 is listed as the official founding of USF basketball, but this team was an integral part in helping the team that exists today come to be.\nEarly years (1971–1980).\nThe University of South Florida's official basketball team first tipped off as the Golden Brahmans on December 1, 1971, with a 74–73 win at Stetson University. The Brahmans played their first season as a member of the NCAA College Division (now NCAA Division II). Their first home game was marked by a 98–77 loss to Florida at Curtis Hixon Hall in downtown Tampa, which would serve as USF's primary arena of the seven courts the team would call home before the opening of the on campus Sun Dome for the 1980–81 season, and was the only arena USF used every season through 1980. South Florida's first home win would come on December 18 against Baldwin Wallace. The Brahmans topped 100 points for the first time in just their tenth game, beating Florida A&amp;M 103–102. USF only played one game at their other home for the 1971–72 season, beating Missouri-St. Louis 85–82 at Fort Homer W. Hesterly Armory in West Tampa. The Golden Brahmans would finish their inaugural season with a record of 8–17, but recorded their first winning season the next year going 14–11.\nFor the 1973–74 season USF made the jump to NCAA Division I, where they remain today. That year would see the Brahmans split time in 3 arenas, the aforementioned Curtis Hixon Hall and Fort Homer W. Hesterly Armory, as well as the Bayfront Center in St. Petersburg, Florida. The Bayfront Center was nearly 40 miles from USF's main campus in Tampa, but sat across the street from the USF St. Petersburg campus. Games were played there in the coming years to give the students at the St. Petersburg campus the rare opportunity to watch their school play a few times per year. They posted a 10–3 combined record at their 3 home courts, but were only 1–13 in road and neutral site games, and for that reason USF fired their first ever coach Don Williams. The Golden Brahmans recorded their first 15 win season in 1974–75 under first year coach Bill Gibson. Gibson died of a heart attack in the summer of 1975 at the age of 47.\nUnder new coach Chip Conner, USF finally recorded their first win at the Bayfront Center on senior night of their 1975–76 campaign. That season also brought the Brahmans their fourth home in the Lakeland Civic Center (now known as the RP Funding Center) in Lakeland, Florida, and gave South Florida its best win percentage for a men's basketball season until 2023–24 at .704 with a 19–8 record.\nThe next year, the Golden Brahmans joined the Sun Belt Conference, but took a big step backwards compared to the previous year going just 9–18 overall and 2–4 in conference games. The Brahmans would find yet another building to call home in 1977–78, playing 2 games at Hillsborough Community College. They would play their first ever game on their own campus on opening night of the 1978–79 season, beating Eckerd College 90–70 at the USF Gymnasium, which still stands today adjacent to the Yuengling Center as the Campus Recreation Center. USF would go undefeated in their 3 on campus games that season, much to the delight of the students who could now attend games more easily. However, USF decided not to play any games on campus for the 1979–80 season, instead opting to play home games at their seventh and final arena before moving on campus full time with Expo Hall at the Florida State Fairgrounds in Tampa. South Florida fittingly closed out this era with an 81–72 victory at Curtis Hixon Hall against Stetson, the team the Brahmans defeated in their first ever game.\nLee Rose era (1980–1986).\nUSF opened the 1980–81 season with three new things: a new nickname, changing from the Golden Brahmans to the Bulls; a new on-campus arena called the Sun Dome; and a new head coach in Lee Rose. Rose was a close personal friend of USF Athletic Director Dick Bowers and was coming fresh off a Final Four appearance with Purdue the year prior, as well as having another Final Four appearance with USF's fellow Sun Belt member Charlotte in 1977. Rose's Bulls recorded their first win in the Sun Dome on December 6, 1980, against UNC Greensboro after dropping their first two games to Florida A&amp;M and Duke. Led by All-American candidate and all-time leading scorer to that point Tony Grier, the Bulls would not lose another regular season home game for over a year, with the next loss coming after a school record 21 game home winning streak that stands to this day. South Florida ended the regular season 17–9, including their first ever win against a ranked opponent when they beat No. 18 South Alabama on February 12. The Bulls also made their first ever postseason tournament, going to the 1981 National Invitation Tournament. Home attendance jumped 256% in the 80–81 season with the new on campus arena, which was soon nicknamed the \"Rose Garden\" after coach Rose. The Sun Dome also brought another thing: better recruiting. The university's former gym situation was described as \"disastrous for recruiting\", but the 1981–82 season saw the arrival of highly touted freshman and Tampa native Charlie Bradley. Bradley is widely regarded as the greatest player in USF history and is the school's all-time leading scorer with 2,319 points, despite playing only 1 season with the adoption of the 3 point line. USF finished the 81–82 season with a solid 17–11 showing and a 14–2 record at home. South Florida also won the inaugural Florida Four tournament in December 1981 over Florida, Florida State, and conference foe Jacksonville.\n1982–83 was by far the young program's most successful season at the time. The Bulls won the second Florida Four, which was discontinued after the season. The 82–83 squad recorded the first 20 win season in team history, going 22–10. Rose's 82–83 team also finished as runners up in the Sun Belt Conference tournament and won the program's first ever postseason game, defeating Fordham in the first round of the 1983 National Invitation Tournament. Finally, Charlie Bradley was named Sun Belt Player of the Year for the 1982–83 season. USF followed up their historic season with another 17–11 record in 1983–84, then went 18–12 in 1984–85 with another second round exit in the NIT after upsetting Wake Forest in the first round.\n1985–86 was the final year with Lee Rose at the helm for the Bulls, who posted a 14–14 record. Rose would leave the Bulls to become an assistant coach for the San Antonio Spurs. South Florida would finish the 6 season Rose era with an overall record of 106–69.\nBobby Paschal era (1986–96).\nThe Bulls first three years under new head coach Bobby Paschal were not good, going an overall 21–63 and all 3 seasons coming with at least 20 losses. Many Bulls fans were calling for Paschal to be fired prior to the 1989–90 season. But the Bulls turned it around, becoming one of the only teams in NCAA men's basketball history to go from 20 losses to 20 wins in a single season. USF made its first ever NCAA tournament, claiming the Sun Belt's autobid to the Big Dance after winning the conference tournament behind future USF Athletic Hall of Fame inductee Radenko Dobraš's Sun Belt Tournament MVP showing. USF's dream season ended with a hard-fought 79–67 loss to 2nd seed Arizona. South Florida nearly eclipsed the 20 win mark again the next season, winning 19 games and securing their fourth NIT berth in 11 years.\nIn 1991–92, the Bulls left the Sun Belt for the Metro Conference and won 19 games for the second straight year, securing an at-large berth in the 1992 NCAA tournament. This stretch is the only time in program history where the Bulls have made a postseason tournament in three consecutive years. The departure of Radenko Dobraš after 1992 brought the arrival of another USF Hall of Fame member in freshman Chucky Atkins, but the Bulls struggled in 1992–93 and 93–94, going 8–19 and 10–17 respectively. USF turned it around in 1994–95, going 18–12 and making the quarterfinals of the 1995 NIT.\nUSF had another new conference for the 1995–96 season after the Metro Conference merged with the Great Midwest Conference to form Conference USA. The Bulls finished just 2–12 in their new conference and 12–16 overall in what would be Bobby Paschal's last year as head coach. Paschal retired from his position, but stayed with the team in an advisory role for another 8 years, and would later be inducted into the USF Athletic Hall of Fame. In Paschal's 10 years as head coach, South Florida went 127–159, the most wins all time by any USF men's basketball coach.\nSeth Greenberg era (1996–2003).\nAfter Paschal stepped down, the Bulls poached Long Beach State head coach Seth Greenberg. Greenberg had made two NCAA tournaments in the previous four years with LBSU and was coming off a Big West Conference regular season title. It was believed Greenberg would keep both his and the program's momentum going with USF. In Greenberg's first year as coach however, the Bulls finished just 8–19. 1997–98 was a turnaround though, and South Florida picked up a 17–13 record. After an even 14–14 campaign in 1998–99, USF won another 17 games and a regular season Conference USA Red Division title at the turn of the millennium, and qualified for the NIT for the first time in five years. The Bulls were ousted in the first round at New Mexico. USF improved even further the next two years, going 18–13 and 19–13 respectively. Greenberg's squad would only see one postseason game out of these seasons though, a loss to Ball State in the first round of the 2002 NIT.\nAfter a 15–14 season in 2002–03 with two starters out due to injuries, Greenberg left Tampa to become the head coach at Virginia Tech, citing his desire to coach in the Big East. His teams had a total record of 108–100, making him one of three USF head coaches to eclipse 100 wins (Rose and Paschall) and one of three to post an overall winning record at the school (Gibson and Rose).\nBig East years.\nUSF's second to last year in Conference USA and first under new coach Robert McCullum would give them 20 losses for the first time since 1988–89, a streak that lasted 15 years. Their last year before joining the Big East was somewhat better at 14–16.\nThe University of South Florida received an invitation to join the Big East to counteract Boston College, Miami, and ironically for former Bulls coach Seth Greenberg, Virginia Tech leaving for the Atlantic Coast Conference. The basketball team's first season in the new conference was marked by their second 20 loss season in three years, going 7–22. They went an abysmal 1–15 against Big East foes, last place in the conference. In what would be McCullum's last year as head coach, the Bulls went 12–18 in 2006–07 and nearly finished last in the conference again. Athletic Director Lee Roy Selmon fired McCullum, whose four teams went a total of 40–76 and 10–54 in conference games. In 2007, former player Tony Grier authored \"A Raging Bull\" Chasing the Big Time, the only comprehensive overview of the rapid rise of the basketball program and sports in general at USF.\nThe Bulls would go on to hire former Arkansas coach Stan Heath, and yet again came dangerously close to losing 20 games in 2007–08. The next year USF picked up a third 20 loss season in six years with a 9–22 record. The lone bright spot of the year was their first ever win against a top 10 opponent, defeating No. 8 Marquette by one point on February 6, 2009. Coach Heath shined on the hot seat the next season, bringing the school its first 20 win season in 20 years, receiving votes in the AP Poll for the first time in team history, and making the 2010 NIT, though they lost in the first round of their first postseason appearance since 2002 to NC State. It was the second time the Bulls had gone from 20 losses to 20 wins in a single season, and they would do it again two years later.\nAfter a 10–23 showing in their 2010–11 campaign, the Bulls turned it around yet again in 2011–12, playing without their usual home court as the Sun Dome was undergoing renovations. The Tampa Bay Times Forum proved to be good luck for the Bulls as their main home, going 10–2 in those games. They also played some home games at the Bob Martinez Sports Center on the University of Tampa's campus (where they went 3–0) and at one at their former home Lakeland Civic Center, which was now called the Lakeland Center (1–0). Despite being selected on media day to finish 14th in the Big East, the Bulls had a winning record in conference games for the first time since leaving Conference USA, going 12–6 which put them tied for 4th. After a 20-year drought, their 20–13 record on Selection Sunday earned USF their third ever bid to the NCAA tournament. As a No. 12 seed, they would have to face California in the First Four play in game. There, South Florida won their first NCAA tournament game in school history 65–54 and advanced to play No. 5 seed Temple. The Bulls shocked the world again by upsetting the Owls 58–44 to move on to the round of 32 for the first time ever. This win tied the school record for wins in a season at 22. The Cinderella story would end in the next round though, as the Bulls fell to the Ohio Bobcats 62–56. The Bulls received one vote in the final Coaches Poll of the season, their first in team history. After the season, Stan Heath was named Big East Coach of the Year.\nLooking to show that 2011–12 was not a fluke, USF started the 2012–13 season at a respectable 10–3. But it would only go downhill from there, as the Bulls went just 3–15 against Big East opponents for a final record of 12–19. This would be the Bulls last season in the Big East as the conference would split prior to the 2013–14 season, where South Florida went 12–20 overall and 3–15 in the new American Athletic Conference. After the season, Stan Heath was fired by USF. His teams went a total of 97–130.\nOrlando Antigua era (2014–2017).\nDominican National Team Head Coach and Kentucky Wildcats assistant Orlando Antigua was hired to replace Heath and turn the program around. Antigua was an assistant at Kentucky for five years with two Final Fours under his belt and had won a national championship with the Wildcats in 2012. Antigua went 9–23 and 7–24 in his first two seasons respectively, and was fired midway through the 2016–17 season. Assistant Coach Murry Bartow served as interim coach for the remainder of the year.\nBrian Gregory era (2017–2023).\nThe Bulls then hired Brian Gregory, a consultant at Michigan State under Tom Izzo to become the tenth coach in program history. After a fifth straight 20 loss season in 2017–18, South Florida bounced back more than many Bulls fans could have ever hoped in 2018–19. The Bulls won 24 games for the first time in school history, and won the College Basketball Invitational against former Big East rival DePaul. Coming in red hot off a senior night comeback victory after being down by 7 with 24 seconds to play, capped off by a buzzer beater from senior Laquincy Rideau, the Bulls 2019–20 season was cut short less than an hour before they were set to play rival Central Florida in round one of the conference tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ending their season at 14–17. After disappointing campaigns in his following three seasons, Gregory was fired by the Bulls.\nAmir Abdur-Rahim era (2023–present).\nUSF hired former Kennesaw State head coach Amir Abdur-Rahim as Gregory's replacement. Abdur-Rahim had just led Kennesaw State to their first ever Division I NCAA Tournament the prior season. During Abdur-Rahim's first season, USF defeated a top-10 opponent for the second time in team history, erasing a 20-point deficit on the road against No. 10 Memphis. On February 12, the Bulls received votes in both the AP Poll and Coaches Poll, their second time receiving votes in each poll, and first time receiving votes in both polls in the same week. The Bulls clinched a share of their first regular season conference title in team history on February 25, the same day they set a new team record with 13 consecutive wins. On February 26, 2024, USF was ranked No. 25 in both the AP and Coaches polls, marking the first time in school history that the team was officially ranked in either poll. The Bulls clinched the conference title outright after defeating Charlotte away on March 2. Amir Abdur-Rahim was unanimously named the American Athletic Conference Coach of the Year and Chris Youngblood was named the AAC Player of the Year. The Bulls reached the NIT and defeated rival Central Florida in the first round before losing to VCU in the second round.

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Gattamelata",
        "text": "The Equestrian Statue of Gattamelata is an Italian Renaissance sculpture by Donatello, dating from 1453, today in the Piazza del Santo in Padua, Italy. It portrays the condottiere Erasmo da Narni, known as \"Gattamelata\", who served mostly under the Republic of Venice, which ruled Padua at the time. It is the first full-size equestrian statue of the Italian Renaissance.\nDescription.\nAfter Erasmo of Narni's death in 1443, according to John Julius Norwich, the Republic of Venice, as a sign of gratitude and respect, paid for a sculpture in his honor. (This payment has been disputed. \"See below\".) Measuring 340 x 390 cm (the base measuring 780 x 410 cm), it is the earliest surviving Renaissance equestrian statue and the first to reintroduce the grandeur of Classical equestrian portraiture. After its conception, the statue served as a precedent for later sculptures honoring military heroes for their continued effort in the wars.\nThe statue, as were all bronze statues of this time, was made using the lost wax method. The statue sits on a pedestal, and both the condottiero and his horse are portrayed in life size. Instead of portraying the soldier as larger-than-life, as in the classical Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, where a sort of hierarchy of size demonstrates the subject's power, Donatello used emotion, position, and symbolism to convey the same message. Thus, Donatello makes a statement of the power of the real-life individual; he does not need to embellish or make grander whom Gattamelata was – the simple depiction of the real man is enough to convey his power.\nThe pedestal under the horse is composed of two reliefs toward the top with fake doors underneath. The doors symbolize the gates of the underworld, lending the feeling of a tomb, though the monument was never a burial place. One relief shows Gattamelata's coat of arms flanked by two putti that are pointing to it. The other relief is of angels displaying battle armor.\nStyle.\nErasmo da Narni (Gattamelata) sits high on his horse, looking out to the distance. The emotion on his face is serious. Donatello portrays Gattamelata as a composed, alert and watchful leader. The depiction of force of character and the reference to the power of real people flows with the Renaissance themes of individualism and humanism.\nThe horse echoes the alert, self-contained and courageous air of the rider. The realistic depiction of its muscular form reveals the Renaissance concern with anatomical study that was later developed in Leonardo da Vinci's studies for the Sforza equestrian monument.\nDonatello also conveys Gattamelata's power with symbolism. He commands a powerful horse and both appear ready for battle. The horse's front left hoof rests on an orb, a cannonball, which symbolizes military advances, representing his power of the Venician army. Gattamelata was hired by Venice and made many advances to solidify the \"terra\" or earth around Venice for the Venician Government. This statue was raised by his family to honor the General. &lt;Dr. Beth Harris and Dr. Steven Zucker. Khan Academy&gt;. This is especially weird and noticeable as Gattamelata was not a head of state. Gattamelata is portrayed as a warrior figure, carrying a baton symbolising his military leadership and with a lengthy sword. While Gattamelata died in his 70s, Donatello depicts him at the height of his power, further emphasizing his might and abilities.\nThe \"Equestrian statue of Gattamelata\" is a sharp departure from earlier, post-Classical equestrian statues, such as the Gothic Bamberg Horseman (c. 1230s). While the Bamberg Horseman depicts a German emperor, it lacks the dimension, power, and naturalism of Gattamelata. While that rider is also in fairly realistic proportion to his horse, he lacks the strength of Gattamelata. The latter is portrayed as a real man, his armor a badge of status; this ruler, however, appears almost deflated, lost in the carefully sculpted drapery that covers him. His power is derived solely from his crown, reflecting the differences that Renaissance individualism produced: here, position – the crown – is what matters, whereas in Gattamelata, it is the individual and his character that matter.\nA comparison between the sculpture and that of Marcus Aurelius' equestrian statue shows how closely Donatello looked to classical art and its themes. In this depiction of Marcus Aurelius, the emperor dwarfs his horse, dominating it by size. However, the emperor also has a facial expression of dominance and determination. Marcus' horse is dressed up, and, while the emperor himself is clad in robes, not armor, he appears both the political and military leader. The attention to the horse's musculature and movement and the realistic depiction of the emperor (forgiving his size) are mirrored in \"Gattamelata\". Also similar is the feeling of grandeur, authority, and power both portraits exude.\nAnother element that Donatello took from ancient sculpture is the trick of adding a support (a sphere) under the raised front leg of the horse, which appears also in the lost Regisole of Pavia, a bronze equestrian statue from either the late Western Roman Empire, the Ostrogothic Kingdom or the Byzantine Exarchate of Ravenna. In this sculpture a standing cat was used to carry the load under the horseshoe.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

Syracuse plays its home games at Tennity Ice Skating Pavilion in Syracuse, New York.\nHistory.\n2008–09 season.\nOn March 6, 2008, it was announced that the Orange would join College Hockey America. Syracuse was the fifth school to join the conference for women's hockey.\nPaul Flanagan, who coached the St. Lawrence Skating Saints women's ice hockey program to five NCAA Frozen Four appearances was appointed as the first coach for the Orange women's ice hockey program. Flanagan had been the 2001 ECAC and American Hockey Coaches Association Coach of the Year. For the inaugural season, Flanagan was joined by Graham Thomas, who played for Mannheim Jung Adler in Germany, and Erin O'Brien, a two-time All-American at Plattsburgh State, an NCAA Division III school for women's ice hockey.\nSome of the first players for the team were transfer players from other schools. Gabrielle Beaudry, transferred to the Orange from Boston College. Cheyenne Bojeski was a transfer from Mercyhurst, while Julie Rising came to the Orange from Bemidji State. Lucy Schoedel and Stefany Marty were both transfers from New Hampshire.\nThe Orange's inaugural season was in 2008–09, and the team played its first ever game on Wednesday, October 1, 2008 at Colgate. During the first game Lucy Schoedel recorded 34 saves and Megan Skelly scored the first goal in Syracuse women's ice hockey history nine seconds into the game. Despite holding a 2–0 lead in the game, the Orange lost to Colgate by a score of 3–4. The following two games were against the eventual NCAA champion Wisconsin Badgers on October 2 and 3. Despite losing both games, Lucy Schoedel made seventy five saves in two games. A week later, Syracuse played in its first ever College Hockey America conference game. The Orange took on the Robert Morris Colonials. Lucy Schoedel recorded her 100th career save (and totaling 130 stops in just four games) in a 1–0 losing effort. Team captain Stefanie Marty scored her first goal for Syracuse on October 17. It was a 4–2 loss at Quinnipiac. Of note, Cheyenne Bojeski also scored her first ever goal for Syracuse. The following day, co-captains Julie Rising and Stefanie Marty would both score as Syracuse won its first ever game by a 2–0 tally.\nMarch 5, 2009 was the first postseason game in Orange history. In the quarterfinal round of the College Hockey America tournament, the Orange were ousted by the Niagara Purple Eagles by a score of 3–2. Freshman forward Kylie Klassen made history by scoring the first playoff goal in the program's history.\n Assists went to Megan Skelly and Julie Rising.\n2009–10 season.\nAfter a slow start to the season, the Orange won their first game of the season on October, 2009 in a 3–1 win over the Providence Friars. The win would be the first of a four-game win streak after starting the season winless in the first six games. The start of the 2009–10 season was highlighted by eight straight road games to start the season, after a home exhibition game against the University of Guelph. By December 2009, the team was ranked in the ranked tenth in the USA Today/USA Hockey Magazine poll. The ranking marked the first time the Orange was nationally ranked in the program's history.\nOn March 5, 2010, the Orange won the first playoff game in program history. Sophomore Lisa Mullan scored two goals, as the Orange defeated Niagara by a score of 5–3. In addition, freshman Isabel Menard added three points. The Orange advanced to the CHA Championship against rival Mercyhurst but fell 1–3.\n2010–11 season.\nOn October 1, 2010, by tying Northeastern in the season opener, it marked the first time that the Orange started the season unbeaten. Stefanie Marty had two goals in the game. Northeastern featured her twin sister Julia Marty. It was the first time the sisters had ever played against each other in their NCAA careers. With a 4–2 defeat of New Hampshire on October 8, 2010, the Orange is off to its best start in program history (1–0–1). In the win, senior transfer Ashley Cockell scored her first career goal for the Orange. Freshman goaltender Kallie Billadeau made 26 saves as she played in her first game for the Orange.\nThe Orange continued their best start in program history with a 2–2–1 record. The Orange registered a 7–1 win against Connecticut on the 16th of October. Syracuse's seven goals against Connecticut ties for second all-time in Orange history. Twelve different players registered points. Isabel Menard recorded the first hat trick in school history and added an assist. In addition, freshman Sadie St. Germain scored her first career goal and had two assists in the win. The Orange outshot the Huskies 38–19. In faceoffs, they had a 38–17 advantage over them. On November 30, Kallie Billadeau set a Syracuse record with 57 saves in a 4–1 loss against No. 1 Cornell. By December 6, 2010, Isabel Menard had nine multiple-point scoring games, setting a Syracuse program record. The team ended the season\n2018-2019.\nSyracuse won its first CHA Tournament championship in 2019, defeating Robert Morris by a score of 6-2. Orange forward Lindsay Eastwood scored three goals in the tournament, tying the league record. It was Syracuse's 7th appearance in the championship game. En route, they defeated Lindenwood in the quarterfinals and Mercyhurst in the semi-finals. As CHA champions, the Orange earned an automatic berth in the NCAA tournament, their first appearance ever.

The team is organised by the Seychelles Cricket Association (SCA) which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2010 and an associate member in 2017.\nHistory.\nFollowing the surrender of the Seychelles to the British Empire in the 1814 Treaty of Paris, then one can assume the game was played in some capacity in the 19th century. Following the independence of the Seychelles from the United Kingdom in 1979, the game on the islands went into decline.\nRecently the game has seen an upsurge in popularity, mostly fuelled by expat communities on the island from cricket playing nations, but also involving local people. Until a few years ago the Seychelles played the Maldives and Maurindia of Mauritius in a triangular tournament.\nIn March 2010, SCA president Jonathon Paul declared the country's intention to apply for affiliate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC). This was granted, with the Seychelles being recognised as the 105th member of the ICC. Shortly after becoming a member of the ICC, Paul announced plans to build an international standard cricket ground to encourage the growth of cricket in the Seychelles. Land on Perseverance Island was set aside for its construction.\nSeychelles made its international debut at the 2011 ICC Africa Twenty20 Division Three tournament in Ghana. The team won its first three matches, against Mali, Gambia and Morocco, ultimately losing to Rwanda by eight runs in the tournament final. Seychelles finished runner-up to Zambia at the 2012 ICC Africa Twenty20 Division Three tournament. The team was captained by Kaushal Patel and played eight matches in five days, winning six and losing two games, both to Zambia. They notably defended a total of 71 runs against Cameroon, winning by nine runs, and defeated Saint Helena in a super over with a six off the last ball.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Seychelles and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Seychelles\n\"Last updated 25 November 2022\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #1922.

Sometimes I didn't even know if he needed the rest of the team.\"\nThis anticipation that something spectacular can happen at any moment has surrounded Flutie in the pros.\nGalvin should know. He was in the Orange Bowl, where Flutie outdueled Bernie Kosar and threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Gerald Phelan as time expired for a 47–45 victory over Miami...\nThe Jets kept New England scoreless in the first half, but eventually lost 14–13.\n\"The New York Times\" describes Galvin's trade back to the Jets for the 1990 season;Galvin a Jet Again\nJohn Galvin, a linebacker who was a special-teams player for the Jets in 1988, rejoined the club Saturday after he was waived by the Minnesota Vikings, with whom he spent last season. Galvin played for Boston College for four years, and wound up there as the starting right outside linebacker. That is a position that has proved hardest to fill for the Jets this summer. The club's new linebacker coach is Monte Kiffin, who coached Galvin last year with the Vikings. Galvin's immediate role will probably will be on special teams and as a backup linebacker.\nIn his 4-year, 52-game NFL career, he had two fumble recoveries.\nEarly years.\nGalvin was born July 9, 1965, in Lowell, Massachusetts, and played football for Lowell High School from 1979 to 1983.\nCollege years.\nGalvin attended Boston College under head coach Jack Bicknell as a four-year letterman from 1984–1987, and graduated with a degree in speech communications.\nIn week 8 of Galvin's senior year, he ripped into the 14th ranked Tennessee Volunteers offense with 8 tackles, 1 sack, and an interception, as BC upset the Vols 20–18.\nLater years.\nIn 1993, Galvin was inducted into the Lowell High School's Athletic Hall of Fame.\nIn the mid-2000s, Galvin started \"Lowell Junior High Football\", a free football program for pre-high schoolers, in the Lowell area, who were above the size cutoff or could not afford to play in the other leagues.\nAccording to the Lowell Sun's March 2, 2010 article by Christopher Scott; In the Winter of 2010, Galvin was asked to be one of eleven member committee to choose the next Lowell High School football head coach."

He attended the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, where he was a 1962 College Baseball All-America Team selection.\nFletcher was born in Elmira, New York in 1942. That year, his father, Glen, was playing minor league baseball in Elmira with the Elmira Pioneers.\nListed as tall and , Fletcher signed with the Tigers in 1962 and spent the bulk of the season with the Knoxville Smokies of the Sally League, getting into 17 games (with 11 starts) and posting a sterling 2.33 earned run average with two complete games and a shutout. Detroit recalled him in September when rosters expanded to 40 men, and on the 12th, he made his MLB debut at Tiger Stadium. Entering a game against the Boston Red Sox with Detroit trailing, 6–2, he pitched the eighth and ninth innings, allowing two bases on balls, one hit, and a wild pitch, but he held the Bosox off the scoreboard. He struck out one hitter, pitcher Mike Fornieles. His line during those two innings pitched ultimately constituted his big-league statistical legacy.\nWithin two weeks of his Major League debut, Fletcher was admitted to Henry Ford Hospital with the left side of his body paralyzed. He was diagnosed with thrombophlebitis and missed the entire 1963 season. When he returned to baseball, his arm was much weaker and the Tigers released him after parts of five more minor league seasons.\nHe signed with the Minnesota Twins to finish the 1968 minor league season but told \"Sports Illustrated\" that he would retire and return home to Illinois to finish his degree if he was not selected in the 1968 Major League Baseball expansion draft. He would not be selected in the expansion draft and 1968 would be his final professional baseball season.\nHis son Darrin, a catcher, had a 14-season, 1,245-game MLB career for four clubs and was a 1994 National League All-Star.\nTom Fletcher died in Oakwood, Illinois, on May 9, 2018.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

        "text": "The Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey team plays for the University of Minnesota Duluth at the AMSOIL Arena in Duluth, Minnesota. The team is a member of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) and competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in the Division I tier. The Bulldogs have won five NCAA Championships.\nHistory.\nOn September 10, 1997, University of Minnesota Duluth Chancellor Kathryn A. Martin and Athletic Director Bob Corran announced that women's Division I hockey would be making its debut at UMD for the 1999–2000 season. On April 20, 1998, Shannon Miller, head coach of Team Canada at the 1998 Winter Olympics, was hired as the head coach.\nOn October 1, 1999, the Bulldogs played their first exhibition game in Salt Lake City, Utah, against the Olympic Oval Team from Calgary, Alberta. This game opened the new hockey facility for the 2002 Olympic Games.\nThe Bulldogs played the Wisconsin Badgers on October 8, 1999, in the first women's WCHA conference game at the Kohl Center in Madison, WI. It was the highest attended game of the season (3,892) and resulted in an 8–0 defeat of the Badgers. Forward Maria Rooth (Ängelholm, Sweden) was selected as Player of the Week in the WCHA on November 22, 1999, the first for UMD.\nThe Bulldogs season-starting winning streak of 12 games was snapped by Princeton University with a 2–2 tie in Princeton, NJ on December 10, 1999. UMD won the Lake Placid Tournament hosted by St. Lawrence University on January 22, 2000. Freshman goalie Tuula Puputti, freshman forward Hanne Sikio and junior defenseman Brittny Ralph were named to the All-Tournament Team. Sikio was also selected as the Tournament Most Valuable Player. \nThe Minnesota Gophers hand the Bulldogs their first conference loss 4–3 in a sold-out game at Pioneer Hall (Duluth, MN) on February 11, 2000.\nThe Bulldogs clinched the women's WCHA regular season championship on February 26, 2000, with a sweep of Minnesota State-Mankato and earned the number one seed for the 2000 WCHA playoffs.\nUMD took the inaugural NCAA Division I national championship on March 25, 2001, by defeating St. Lawrence University by a score of 4–2. This marked the first NCAA team championship for the Bulldogs. Maria Rooth was named Most Valuable Player of the tournament while her teammates Tuula Puputti and Brittny Ralph were named to the All-Tournament team. On June 25, 2001, the Bulldogs were honored at the White House by President George W. Bush, the first women's hockey team to be invited to the White House.\nFive Bulldogs traveled to Salt Lake City to compete with their national teams at the 2002 Winter Olympics. From the 2001–2002 roster, forwards Maria Rooth and Erika Holst played for bronze medal winner Sweden while forward Hanne Sikio and goaltender Tuula Puputti skated for fourth-place Finland. Kristina Petrovskaia finished fifth with Team Russia. UMD also had two players in the Olympic final game, 2001–2002 newcomer and Olympic gold medalist Caroline Ouellette (Canada) and returning Bulldog and 2002 Olympic silver medalist Jenny Potter (USA).\nThe Bulldogs, 2002 NCAA national women's hockey champions, were recognized by the Minnesota Twins baseball team at the H.H.H. Metrodome in Minneapolis on May 6, 2002. Jenny Potter set an NCAA record (since tied) for most goals in one game with 6. This was accomplished on December 18, 2002, versus St. Cloud State. Ouellette set an NCAA record for most shorthanded goals in one game with 2. This was accomplished on November 14, 2003, versus North Dakota.\nOn March 22, 2010, Duluth Mayor Don Ness presented Shannon Miller with a proclamation declaring Friday, March 26, 2010, as \"Shannon Miller Day.\"\nOn January 21, 2011, The top-ranked Badgers defeated the Bulldogs on the opening night of AMSOIL arena in front of 1,639 fans. The Badgers defeated the Bulldogs 4–1, extending their 11 game-winning streak, best in the NCAA. The Bulldogs still lead the all-time series 26–21–9. A ceremonial puck drop featured Bulldog legends Jenny Potter, Caroline Ouellette and Maria Rooth. In both games, the Bulldogs wore special edition black jerseys. The following day (January 22), for only the second time this season, the Bulldogs found themselves in a two-goal deficit after the first period of play. Despite trailing the No. 1 University of Wisconsin by two goals in each of the three periods, the Bulldogs scored three goals in the final 11 minutes of regulation to earn a 4–4 draw with the top-ranked Badgers in AMSOIL Arena.\nRivalries.\nMinnesota–Duluth, a traditional rival to the Minnesota Golden Gophers in men's hockey, would start its own rivalry in the women's game. The school gave a three-year, $210,000 contract to Shannon Miller, who coached Canada to the 1998 Olympic final in Nagano. Miller recruited players from Canada, Finland and Sweden, including four Olympians. The rivalry grew as Miller recruited a pair of players away from Minnesota: star forward Jenny Schmidgall, (whose 93 points in 1999–2000 would lead the nation), and defenseman Brittny Ralph, who would serve as the Bulldogs' first ever captain. In the first season, Duluth would lose just once to the Gophers in their first five meetings, which included a 2–0 Bulldogs victory in the final of the WCHA tournament.\nAttendance.\nWhen the program still played at the DECC, despite the team's success, UMD women's hockey rarely drew a large crowd to its home ice. According to the website US College Hockey Online, the women's hockey team averaged 610 people out of an official 5233 seats, an 11.6% capacity. Even while winning five national titles, more than any other program at that time, the Bulldogs averaged sixth in attendance in women's Division I hockey. The men's team, however, averaged an attendance of 4253 per game having won one national title, an 86.2% capacity rating. They moved in with the men's team in 2010 to the new AMSOIL Arena.\nSeason by season results.\n\"Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties\"\nOlympians.\nThe UMD Bulldogs program has had more Winter Olympians than any other program in the history of NCAA Division I Women's Ice Hockey; 33 current or former Bulldogs have competed in the Olympic Women's ice hockey tournament.\nThere are only two Bulldogs players who have won gold in the midst of their college eligibility: Haley Irwin with Team Canada in 2014 and Maddie Rooney with Team USA in 2018.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

        "text": "The 2003–04 Providence Friars men's basketball team represented Providence College in the Big East Conference. The team finished with an 11–5 conference record and a 20–9 record overall.\nComing off an 18–14 record and a second-round NIT loss in 2002–03, the team returned all five starters for coach Tim Welsh's sixth season with the Friars. However, forward Romuald Augustin transferred to Bryant College for his fifth year of eligibility, while walk-on guard Chris Burns also transferred to Bryant for his sophomore season. The team also lost two departing seniors, guard Kareem Hayletts and forward Stephen Traugott. On February 24, after playing in 12 games for the Friars, senior forward Māris Ļaksa left the team to play professional basketball in Slovenia.\nThe Friars began the season receiving votes in both polls, but not ranked in either. Following an 8–1 start that included a win over #14 Illinois, the Friars earned a #25 ranking in the AP Poll in time for their January 5 matchup with #18 Texas. The Friars took the Longhorns to overtime, but as time expired in the overtime period, Texas forward P. J. Tucker released a layup to give the Longhorns a two-point win. The controversial shot was reviewed for more than five minutes by the officials, who determined that the clock read \"00.0\" but the red backboard light had not yet gone on when the ball was released, which at the time overruled the clock.\nDespite the close loss, the Friars re-emerged in the top 25 three weeks later, following a road win over #4 Connecticut. A six-game winning streak that began with a win over #18 Syracuse propelled the Friars to a #12 ranking in the AP Poll on March 1. This was followed by two home losses to close out the regular season, and a #3 seed in the 2004 Big East men's basketball tournament. Following a first-round bye, the Friars dropped a three-point game to Villanova in the quarterfinals, leading to a #5 seed in the NCAA tournament. In the first round, the Friars were defeated 66–58 by the #12 seed, Pacific. The Friars ended the season with a #21 ranking in the AP Poll.\nThe Friars were led in scoring (18.9 ppg) and rebounding (9.4 rpg) by junior forward Ryan Gomes. He became the fourth Friar to be named a First Team All-American by the Associated Press.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| Exhibition games\n!colspan=9| Non-conference games\n!colspan=9| Big East regular season\n!colspan=9| Big East tournament\n!colspan=9| NCAA tournament"

        "text": "World Surfing Reserves (WSR) is a program launched in 2009 by the non-governmental organization Save the Waves Coalition aimed at protecting global surf habitats. The program proactively identifies, designates and enshrines international waves, surf zones and surrounding environments, protecting them from the threat of development.\nHistory.\nThe idea to protect surf spots originally came from to one of the cofounders of the program, the National Surfing Reserves (NSR) in Australia. After four years of naming surf spots in Australia, NSR partnered with the NGO Save the Waves Coalition and launched the World Surfing Reserves to go international with their protection program. Professional big-wave surfer Joao de Macedo is also a co-founder of the program. It was officially launched at the Value of Waves Roundtable held in Half Moon Bay, California.\nLocations.\nThere are currently twelve surfing reserves across the world. World Surfing Reserves are nominated through a selection process and there are currently dozens of proposed WSRs covering nearly every continent on the planet. The dates indicated the commencement of the commitment by the local and international communities to protect and preserve Malibu as an iconic surf site. \nMission.\nThe mission of the World Surfing Reserves (WSR) program is to gain international recognition and support for wave and coastal protection around the world by creating a global network of designated surfing reserves. WSR also recognizes environmental, social, cultural and economic benefits of waves. WSR was created in conjunction with National Surfing Reserves Australia, and has established partnerships with the International Surfing Association (ISA), and Stanford University's Center for Responsible Travel (CREST). WSR is also affiliated with the Surf Conservation Partnership led by Conservation International.\nIn August 2009, WSR called for nominations from all national surfing federations. More than 150 sites were nominated from 34 countries. WSR eventually plans to induct 30-40 surf breaks around the world. The program has gained a substantial amount of positive feedback and support from the sport's leaders, including Kelly Slater.\nCouncil and committee.\nWorld Surfing Reserves is led by an international executive committee and vision council. It is the responsibility of these groups to govern the program and make the final wave selections. For a specific surf site to enter WSR, the region must have exceptional and consistent surf, along with a rich history and culture of surfing, as well as strong community support.\nVision Council\n, Will Henry, Jim Moriarty, Tony Butt, Terry Gibson, Len Materman, Miles Walsh, Wallace J. Nichols, Steve Hawk, Wayne “Rabbit” Bartholomew, Tiago Pires, Greg Long, Mark Massara, Chris LaFrankie, Chad Nelsen, Neil Lazarow, Brad Farmer, Manolo Lozano, Juca De Barros, Drew Kampion, Professor Andy Short, Professor Ben Finney.\nExecutive Committee\nProfessor Andy Short, Brad Farmer, Drew Kampion, Will Henry, Dean LaTourrette.\nGoogle Earth Plug-In.\nSave the Waves Coalition also created a Google Earth WSR plug-in that allows organizations and individuals to view nominated sites around the world. The plug-in allows users to learn about a nominated wave's history, location, environmental characteristics and surf culture."

After the match Kennedy stated that he \"bleeds maroon\" and declared himself eligible for Queensland This caused an uproar from NSWRL officials who believed Kennedy (who was born in Lismore, New South Wales) was not eligible for Queensland.\nThis was proven not to be the case as Kennedy had moved to Queensland as a 10-year-old and played all his junior footy at Norths Ipswich, represented Queensland Under 17's and attended Ipswich Grammar School before signing with the Roosters in 2006 and playing for Matraville High School for one year in 2007.

Born in Columbia, South Carolina, he threw and batted right-handed and was listed as tall and .\nCareer.\nThough Martin appeared in just one MLB game, he had a ten-year minor-league career. Originally signed by the New York Giants as an amateur free agent before the season, Martin compiled a 44–43 record and 4.06 earned run average in five seasons in their farm system. He was then acquired by Cincinnati sometime during the season, and posted a 23–7 record, 2.13 ERA, and a Sally League-leading 174 strikeouts for the Columbia Reds, who played in Martin's home town, in .\nThat performance earned him a spot with the big league club for . On April 22, the sixth game of the regular season, the Redlegs was already losing 6-2 to the St. Louis Cardinals with Stan Musial set to lead off the seventh inning, when manager Rogers Hornsby summoned Martin to relieve Bud Podbielan. Martin retired Musial, and got out of his first inning of work unscathed. In his second frame, however, he allowed a lead-off triple to Rip Repulski, followed by a double to Del Rice. After retiring the next two batters, it appeared Martin would escape with just the one run scored; however, Red Schoendienst followed with a double to drive in Rice, and bring Musial back to the plate. Musial grounded out to short to end the inning without further damage.\nFive days later, Martin was optioned back to Columbia, where he would compile a 17–6 record with a 2.14 ERA. His overall minor league stats include 104 wins versus 74 losses in 245 games (128 starts). His minor league ERA was 3.35. While pitching for Columbia, he was the team's bus driver and was also a railroad engineer for Southern Railway.\nFamily.\nTwo of Martin's sons played professional ball. Michael, a left-handed pitcher, was selected fifth overall in the 1970 Major League Baseball Draft by the Philadelphia Phillies, but ultimately was unable to make the major leagues. A year later, the Phillies signed older brother Jerry, an outfielder, as an undrafted free agent. Despite spending three seasons together in the same organization, Michael and Jerry were never teammates. Jerry went on to play 1,018 games in the majors for five clubs between 1974 and 1984."

The first wicket partnership is between the opening batsmen and continues until the first wicket falls. The second wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the number three batsman. This partnership continues until the second wicket falls. The third wicket partnership then commences between the not out batsman and the new batsman. This continues down to the tenth wicket partnership. When the tenth wicket has fallen, there is no batsman left to partner so the innings is closed.\nHighest partnerships by runs.\nThe highest ODI partnership by runs for any wicket is held by the West Indian pairing of Chris Gayle and Marlon Samuels who put together a second wicket partnership of 372 runs during the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Zimbabwe in February 2015.

The committee was formed in 1936. Between 1932 and 2010, Colombia competed in five Summer Olympics, winning eleven medals. In the late 1990s, President of Federation of Skating Carlos Orlando Ferreira proposed training for speed skating athletes, but this proposition was unsuccessful after a lack of funding. Colombia first participated in the Winter Olympics in 2010.\nPreparations and arrival.\nThe efforts of Hanspeter Denzler and Colombian Olympic Committee president and IOC member Andrés Botero led to the establishment of a Colombian ski team in 2007. In 2010, Colombia's delegation consisted of skier Cynthia Denzler, her father Hanspeter, and his brother Fabian, both of which served as coaches. The delegation flew to Vancouver on 10 February and stayed in the Olympic Village. Cynthia Denzler said, \"it is an honour to compete for Colombia and I am happy to do so. Representing the country during the Winter Olympics is a good thing and a dream come true.\"\nCeremonies.\nColombia was one of five nations from South America participating in these Winter Olympics. The opening ceremony was dedicated to Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who died on the day of the opening ceremony in a fatal crash. Greece opened the parade of nations, followed by Canada. Colombia was the nineteenth of 82 delegations to enter the BC Place stadium, after China and before Croatia. Denzler was the flag bearer. At the closing ceremony, which took place at BC Place, the flag bearers formed a circle around the Olympic flame. The flagbearer again was Denzler.\nAlpine skiing.\nColombia assigned its sole delegate, Cynthia Denzler, to alpine skiing. Despite being born in California, she was allowed to compete for Colombia after her father became a citizen of the country."

        "title": "Boxing in Wales",
        "text": "Boxing is a popular sport in Wales, and since the early 20th century Wales has produced a notable number of professional boxers including several World Champions. The most notable boxers include Wales' first World Champion Percy Jones; Jimmy Wilde, who is seen as pound-for-pound one of the World's finest boxers and Joe Calzaghe, who ended his career an undefeated World Champion.\nThe early history of boxing in Wales.\nDespite the sport of boxing in Wales being heavily identified with the industrial south, it was a common pastime in pre-industrial Wales around the country; and was patronized by the local gentry. In the late 18th century, boxing became more commercialised with promoters and publicans organising paid matches that attracted spectators, and with them heavy betting. In 1797 the skilful 'Whitechapel Jew', Daniel Mendoza fought in a match near Neath and 1819 saw exhibition bouts staged by two of England's greatest bare-knuckle boxers, Tom Cribb and Tom Spring. One of the more common ways for the Welsh public to watch a fight was at race meets. Boxing had always been associated with horse racing, and according to the \"Racing Calendar\" the favoured Welsh courses were Brecon, Carmarthen, Knighton, Wrexham and Monmouth. In 1824 the 4,000 racing pundits at Monmouth were also entertained with a fight in which a quarryman called Parry beat Powell in a 103-round contest. The early 19th century also witnessed the emergence of Welsh boxers whose fame extended beyond the confines of the boxing rings. One of the first Welsh fighters of note, despite being born in Southwark in London, was Ned Turner. Turner's parents were both from Montgomeryshire and he was dubbed the \"pugilistic prince of Wales' by the \"North Wales Gazette\" in 1823. \nThe opening of the South Wales Valleys to industrialisation in the mid-1800s saw a large influx of commercial immigration. This was followed by an improved transport network, which in turn allowed larger crowds, and larger wagers, to be brought to the sport of boxing. When the Taff Vale Railway was extended to Merthyr Tydfil in 1840, the locals celebrated by a contest between Cyfarthfa champion John Nash, and Merthyr hardman Shoni Sguborfawr. The adoption of boxing as a sport for the underprivileged in industrial Wales is compared, by Welsh historian Gareth Williams, to the living conditions of the emerging towns themselves. Towns like Merthyr, one of the heartlands of the world's iron industry, with its dire health and living conditions, along with a high rate of industrial injury and death, reinforced in the minds of the working class that life was short and brutal. The sport of boxing, though exploitative of the common man, was still a means to rise above the poverty of everyday life and glamourized the primitive.\nIn 1867, Wales made its first major contribution to boxing, when Llanelli-born sportsman and sport organiser John Graham Chambers devised and drafted the Queensbury Rules, the basic code to which boxing still practices under to this day. Although boxing now had its legitimate code of laws, Wales would often be the location of illegal bare-knuckled fights, and there would be known mountainside locations where locals would meet to watch fights. These illegal fights were often conducted at dawn in isolated or remote areas, though they were still sometimes disrupted by the law. To evade criminal proceedings, fights were often arranged on land near county borders where jurisdiction was vague and law enforcement intermittent. In particular the area between Tafarnaubach near Tredegar and Llangynidr in Powys became the 'nursery for would-be champions' due to its proximity to the borders of three counties. Towards the end of the Victorian period several Welsh boxers, who made their name as mountain fighters, began fighting under Queensbury rules and became well known and respected sportsmen. Among their number were champion fighters, John O'Brien, Dai St. John, Redmond Coleman and butcher brothers Sam and Ivor Thomas. By the early 20th century, boxing had not advanced to a great degree in Wales, and many of the country's early professional boxers began their career fighting in booths at fairgrounds. With the popularity of the sport increasing, a scale of weights and titles evolved, which allowed the emergence of working-class local heroes.\n20th century boxing in Wales.\nIn the first third of the 20th century the South Wales valleys produced a prolific stream of boxing champions. The valleys area around Pontypridd produced more champions during this period than any region of a comparable size in the world. The champions included three boxers from the Rhondda; Tom Thomas of Penygraig, Percy Jones of Porth and Jimmy Wilde from Tylorstown, and Pontypridd's own Freddie Welsh and Frank Moody. All these boxers fought with a particular 'Welsh' stance, upright, and using a combination of fast two-fisted attacks. Of these fighters, Jimmy Wilde stands out as a true great of World boxing, whose diminutive stature and light frame hid an incredible punching power, that was reflected in one of his nicknames, 'The Ghost with the Hammer in his Hand'. Wilde fought over 150 professional bouts, losing just five, and achieved 99 knockouts. Although the coalfields and ironworks of South Wales produced notable fighters, other areas of South Wales also produced memorable fighters. The darling of Cardiff was 'Peerless' Jim Driscoll, who took the featherweight Lonsdale belt in 1910. Other boxers who were able to translate success in Britain abroad, included Gipsy Daniels who fought at Madison Square Garden and Bill Beynon who took the Empire Bantamweight title.\nIn April 1928 the Welsh Boxing Association and Control Board was set up to regulate championships and ensure the safety of the boxers in Wales. It initially attempted to remain independent of the British Boxing Board of Control (BBBC), with whom it had had some disputes, but by 1929 it had amalgamated with the newly reconstituted BBBC, and after that Welsh boxing was managed by the Welsh Area Council. The Welsh Board set about forming a championship for each weight division, and by 1929 all eight weights had a recognised Welsh champion. With the championship formed, the titles could now only be won in a Board of Control designated contest. Although Wales was now recognised within the BBBC as one of the eight areas of their control, the Welsh champions were regarded as representing their country rather than just an administrative area.\nDespite the popularity of team sports in Wales such as rugby union and football, boxing as a solo sport was integral to regional culture in Wales and extremely popular with the working classes. Even when Welsh economic fortunes slumped during the depression in the 1930s, boxing retained popular support, though the number of world championship titles faded. Two Welsh boxers of note emerged during this period, Jack Petersen, who won the British Heavyweight Championship on two occasions and the 'Tonypandy Terror', Tommy Farr, who took the Empire heavyweight crown. Although Farr never achieved the success of previous Welsh boxers, his struggle as a professional fighter, especially his 1937 15 round defeat to Joe Louis, was seen to mirror the struggle of the Welsh workers.\nPost World War II, Wales produced another round of championship contenders, though as with the previous decade they failed to emulate the Welsh boxers of the 1920s. Ronnie James of Pontardawe, Dai Dower of Abercynon and Colin Jones of Gorseinon all held British titles but did not win a world title belt. The later half of the 20th century saw a string of Welsh boxers who engaged the Welsh psyche, with a centred group of fighters coming from the Merthyr area. These Merthyr boxers included welterweight Eddie Thomas, featherweight Howard Winstone and bantamweight Johnny Owen, who lost his life in a fight against Lupe Pintor in 1980.\nWelsh boxing in the twentieth century produced a number of notable light and middle weight boxers, but failed to have a similar impact on the heavyweight categories, which was not reflective of the rest of the United Kingdom. The notable exceptions to this were the Dick Richardson of Newport and Joe Erskine from Cardiff, who, along with England's Henry Cooper and Brian London formed a quartet of promising British heavyweights during the late 1950s and early 1960s.\nThe final decade of the twentieth century saw four Welshmen take World Championship titles. Steve Robinson became the WBO Featherweight Champion in 1993, followed by Robbie Regan (WBO World Bantamweight) in 1996, Barry Jones (WBO World Super-Featherweight) and Joe Calzaghe (WBO Super Middleweight), both in 1997.\n21st century boxing in Wales.\nThe first decade of the 21st century of boxing in Wales was dominated by a single fighter, Joe Calzaghe. Although Calzaghe came to note after beating former Middleweight World Champion Chris Eubank on points in 1997 to win the WBO title, it was during the 2000s that he came to prominence. Calzaghe finished his career with 46 bouts and no losses, one of the few World Champions to retire undefeated.\nOther boxers of note to emerge during the early 21st century include, Jason Cook who became European Lightweight Champion in 2002, Nathan Cleverly the European, British, Commonwealth and WBO World light heavyweight title holder, Gavin Rees former WBA light-welterweight champion and Enzo Maccarinelli former WBO and WBU cruiserweight champion.\nWelsh boxing champions.\nWorld boxing champions from Wales.\nNWS: Newspaper decisions"

        "title": "Run and gun (basketball)",
        "text": "In basketball, run and gun is a fast, freewheeling style of play that features a high number of field goal attempts, resulting in high-scoring games. The offense typically relies on fast breaks while placing less emphasis on set plays. A run-and-gun team typically allows many points on defense as well.\nIn the National Basketball Association (NBA), the run and gun was at its peak in the 1960s when teams scored an average of 115 points a game. Around 2003, the average had dropped to 95. The Boston Celtics were a run-and-gun team in the 1950s and 1960s while winning 11 NBA championships, as were the five-time champion Los Angeles Lakers during their Showtime era in the 1980s. Although the run and gun is believed by many to de-emphasize defense, the Celtics of the '60s had Bill Russell, and the Lakers of the '80s had Kareem Abdul-Jabbar as defensive stoppers. \nCoach Doug Moe, who ran the run and gun with the Denver Nuggets in the 1980s, believed the high scores surrendered were more indicative of the fast pace of the game than a low level of defense. Still, his teams sometimes appeared to give up baskets in order to score one. Though his offensive strategy led to high scores, Moe's Denver teams were never adept at running fast breaks.\nPaul Westhead.\nPaul Westhead coached the Loyola Marymount men's team in the late 1980s using a version of the run and gun.\nWhile run and gun basketball is often thought of as a system of offense, Westhead's system uses a combined offensive and defensive philosophy. Offensively, the team moves the ball forward as quickly as possible and takes the first available shot, often a three-pointer. Westhead's teams try to shoot the ball in less than seven seconds. The aim is to shoot before the defense is able to get set. Defensively, the team applies constant full-court pressure. Generally, the team is willing to gamble on giving away easy baskets for the sake of maintaining a high tempo. \nLoyola Marymount successfully used the system in 1990 when they advanced to the Elite 8 of the NCAA basketball tournament, beating the defending champion Michigan 149–115 along the way. The style has been used at some other teams. \nIn 1990, Westhead was hired by the Denver Nuggets and tried to integrate the LMU system on the team. However, the differences between college and the NBA game became apparent from the beginning. Whereas the LMU system worked on a 40-minute game during a 30–40 game NCAA season, it did not translate to a 48-minute game during an 82-game NBA season. \nThe Nuggets averaged a league-best 119.9 points per game in 1990-91, but also surrendered an NBA record 130.8 points per game. They also allowed 107 points to be scored in a single half to the Phoenix Suns, which also remains an NBA record. Under Westhead, the Nuggets were sometimes called the \"Enver Nuggets\" (as in no \"D,\" or no defense). After the season, Westhead generally abandoned his LMU system and played at a slower pace in hopes of conserving his players' energy during a long season. However, the 1991-92 Nuggets only improved to 24 wins, largely because they continued to give up points so quickly that even their prolific offense couldn't keep up. Westhead was fired after posting a combined two-year record of 44–120. \nWesthead's system has been imitated by other college teams, including Grinnell College. David Arseneault, the architect of the Grinnell System, added to Westhead's system by substituting players in three waves of five players, similar to an ice hockey shift. The highest scoring game in NCAA history was played by two teams (Troy and DeVry-Atlanta) who both employed Westhead's system the entire game, resulting in 399 combined points in 1992."

        "text": "Reginald Woodman Plummer Brown (March 13, 1876 – January 31, 1961) was an American football player, coach, and scout who served as the co-head football coach at Boston University from 1926 to 1929, compiling a record of 11–19–3. He also coached at Harvard University and Brown University.\nEarly life.\nBrown attended Newton High School. He was on the Newton team that won the 1892 junior interscholastic championship and was captain of the 1893 squad. He played tackle for the Harvard freshman team and fullback and halfback for the varsity team. He was a skilled rusher as well as a good punter and dropkicker. He graduated from Harvard College in 1898.\nCoaching.\nBrown coached Harvard's second team from 1902 to 1905. In 1906 head coach Bill Reid promoted him to head of field work and scouting. Reid left after the 1906 season and recommended Brown for the head coaching position, however Joshua Crane was chosen instead. Brown served as Harvard's chief scout and strategist under Percy Haughton. Melville E. Webb Jr. credited Brown with being a \"big factor in Crimson's success\" and R. L. Groves credited Brown for Harvard's \"excellent defensive system\" in the 1914 Harvard–Yale game. Brown gave up his chief strategist role in 1917. From 1919 to 1921 he occasionally consulted the Harvard scouting staff and scouted Navy for Army. In 1922 he returned to coaching as an assistant to Edward N. Robinson at Brown Robinson and Brown were let go after the 1925 season. \nOn April 2, 1926, athletic director George V. Brown hired Robinson and Brown to coach the Boston University football team. It was hoped that the pair would be able to turn BU into a major football program, however, the school was unable to recruit top talent and did not turn out a winning product under Brown and Robinson. In 1926, athletic director W. J. Bingham offered Brown the opportunity to return to Harvard to coach with Huntington Hardwick. The plan was for Brown and Robinson to be in charge of strategy and for Hardwick to teach fundamentals. However, neither Brown and Hardwick would take the job unless they were given the final authority on coaching decisions, which led to the head coaching job going to Arnold Horween instead. By 1930, BU, which had suffered from poor gate receipts during their losing seasons, decided to cut back on its coaches' salaries and reduced the coaching staff from three to two, which led to Brown and Robinson's departure.\nBrown was a member of the Holy Cross coaching staff in 1932, scouted for Northeastern in 1934, and was an assistant coach for the National Football League's Boston Redskins in 1935. In 1940, Brown was named Massachusetts director of physical activities for the national defense program of the National Youth Administration. In 1944 he scouted for Woburn Memorial High School. The following year he served as the interim coach of Milford High School while head coach Charles Bruncato was serving in the United States Marine Corps. In 1947, Brown was named the head scout at Boston College.\nBrown died on January 31, 1961, at his home in Newton Centre, Massachusetts."

        "title": "Louis Jordan (American football)",
        "text": "Louis John Jordan (January 30, 1890 – March 5, 1918) was an American college football player. He played for the University of Texas from 1911 to 1914 and was the first Texas Longhorns player to be selected as an All-American. Jordan was killed by a German artillery barrage while serving in France during World War I. He was among the first four individuals, and the first athlete, inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor. He was also selected as the honorary captain for the all-time University of Texas football team in 2009.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nJordan was born and raised in Gillespie County, near Fredericksburg, Texas. He was the son of William J. Jordan and Auguste (Keller) Jordan. He received his early education in the local public schools, and worked on the family's ranch in Live Oak, Texas. He received his state teaching certificate at age 16 and taught at the Honey Creek school. After teaching school for two sessions, Jordan enrolled at the San Antonio Academy, also known as the West Texas Military Academy, in 1910. He graduated from the San Antonio Academy in 1911 and won the scholarship medal and a scholarship to the University of Texas.\nUniversity of Texas.\nJordan enrolled at the University of Texas in the fall of 1911 as an engineering student. While he was a student at Texas, Jordan was a star athlete in both football and track and field. As a member of the track and field team, Jordan broke the state record for the hammer throw. However, he won his greatest acclaim as a football player. \nWhen Jordan enrolled at the University of Texas in 1911, he reportedly had to be coaxed and dragged into playing football. He \"learned the rudiments of the game\" while playing for Texas and played for the Texas Longhorns football team from 1911–1914. He became known as \"the greatest Longhorn player of the early era of Texas football.\"\nAs a junior in 1913, Jordan led the Longhorns to a one-loss season, with the only loss coming to a Notre Dame Fighting Irish team featuring College Football Hall of Famers Knute Rockne, Gus Dorais and Ray Eichenlaub. His performance in the loss to Notre Dame became a Texas legend. According to a Texas newspaper account, Notre Dame sought to drive Jordan from the field by using four guards against him and subjecting him to the pounding of fullback Ray Eichenlaub. Prior to the Notre Dame game, Jordan had played every minute of every game on offense and defense, and he did not want to quit against Notre Dame. However, Texas coach Dave Allerdice \"would not let the big fellow take any more punishment\" and finally pulled him from the game.\nAfter the 1913 season, Jordan was voted by his teammates to serve as the captain of the 1914 Texas Longhorns football team. As a senior and team captain in 1914, Jordan led the Longhorns to an undefeated and untied season with a record of 8–0. The 1914 team outscored its opponents 358–21, held opponents scoreless in five games, and allowed only a single touchdown in its three other games. After defeating a strong Haskell Indian team, 23–7, Hakell's manager praised the work of the Texas line, and the \"Galveston Daily News\" reported: \"Louis Jordan proved his right to the claim that he is one of the best guards Texas has ever produced, the big blond captain of the orange fighting throughout the game like a demon.\"\nDuring the 1914 Texas–Oklahoma game, Oklahoma's Hap Johnson ran the opening kickoff back 85 yards for a touchdown, but Jordan gathered his teammates around him. Teammate Clyde Littlefield later recalled that Jordan \"told us in no mincing words, with a few cuss words in German and some in English, 'nobody leaves this field until we beat the hell out of them.'\" Texas scored 32 unanswered points and won the game, 32–7. In Jordan's four seasons as a player for the Texas football team, the Longhorns had a record of 27–4 and outscored their opponents 875–158.\nJordan was the first University of Texas football player to be named as an All-American. He was selected as a second-team All-American by Walter Camp at the conclusion of the 1914 season. Camp was notorious for overlooking football players who did not play for the Ivy League schools of the East, and Jordan's selection, even to Camp's second team, was seen as a major concession to Jordan's talent. Damon Runyon, the New York sports writer, saw Jordan play and said, \"Were that man in the East playing with Harvard or Yale he would be heralded from coast to coast as one of the greatest guards of all time.\"\nUniversity of Texas football historian and media relations director Bill Little later wrote of Jordan's contributions in the early years of Longhorns football:\"One of the most popular students at The University of Texas from 1911 through 1915 was a young man of German heritage from Fredericksburg, Texas, named L.J. 'Louis' Jordan. Jordan was like everybody's big brother. He was a round-faced blond who stood over 6 feet tall and weighed 205 pounds -- that was big for the time ... Jordan, in fact, was so gentle by nature he had to be coaxed to play football. But when he did, he became the greatest lineman, both offensively and defensively, of his era.\"\nJordan also won praise for his abilities as a student. Professor T.U. Taylor, head of the engineering department, said of Jordan, \"He was one of the most brilliant men who ever graduated from this department.\"\nJordan was the only athlete included in the initial group of four individuals inducted into the Longhorn Hall of Honor in 1957. In September 2009, Jordan was selected as the honorary captain of the all-time University of Texas football team as chosen by the \"Austin American-Statesman\".\nElectrical engineer.\nJordan graduated with honors in electrical engineering in 1915. Upon his graduation, Jordan returned to the San Antonio Academy where he taught mathematics and science. After one year in teaching, Jordan was hired as the chief engineer for the San Antonio Public Service Company, referred to in some sources as the San Antonio Traction Company.\nService and death in World War I.\nShortly after the United States entered World War I in the Spring of 1917, Jordan left his job with the Public Service Company and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He entered the First Camp for Reserve Officers at Leon Springs, Texas, and received his officer's commission as a first lieutenant in August 1917. Jordan was selected as \"one of the first quota of officers to go to France.\" He arrived in France in October 1917 and was assigned the 42nd Infantry Division in January 1918. Under the command of Douglas MacArthur, the 42nd Division entered the line in the Lunéville sector on the Western Front in February 1918.\nJordan kept a diary during his service in France. On March 1, 1918, five days before he was killed, Jordan wrote in his diary: \"I do not want you to think for a moment that I am taking this thing entirely light-mindedly. No, not at all, but my attitude is this: Do the best you can and know how and then keep on smiling.\" On March 2, 1918, he made his last entry: \"This fighting we are doing now is the real thing. A man gets to be quite a fatalist in this game. If somehow or other they get me -— all well and good. If not —- still better. But somehow I feel safe.\"\nOn the afternoon of March 5, 1918, Jordan was in front of a gun position when the German forces started an artillery barrage. Jordan ordered everyone into a dugout, and a German artillery shell landed at the opening of his dugout. The force of the explosion killed Jordan instantly. He was the first Texas officer and only the third United States officer to be killed in action during World War I.\nJordan's death was reported in Texas newspapers as a major story. The \"Galveston Daily News\" opened its account of the event as follows:\"Lieutenant Louis Jordan of Fredericksburg, whose death occurred in action on the American fighting line in France, March 5, was one of the most famous athletes ever produced at the University of Texas. He was the first Texas officer to give his life in the struggle to make the world safe for democracy. Louie, as he was known to his friends,\nwas a giant both mentally and physically. He measured six feet four inches in height and weighed 225\npounds just before his last football game ... He counted his friends by the hundreds and his admirers were all who met him. \nJordan was posthumously awarded the Croix de Guerre, and resolutions in his honor were passed by the Texas legislature.\nFuneral.\nJordan was initially buried at a military cemetery in Bénaménil, France, but his body was returned to Texas in 1921 for burial in Der Stadt Friedhof at his hometown of Fredericksburg. Before the reburial, Jordan's remains lay in state at the county courthouse, \"the coffin draped with an American flag and under a profusion of flowers.\" Hundreds of Texans filed past the casket \"paying silent respects\" to Jordan. As his flag-draped casket was taken to the cemetery, a uniformed honor guard accompanied the casket, as an \"immense concourse of citizens followed.\" Professor T. U. Taylor of the University of Texas spoke at the funeral, and the services were closed with the firing of guns over the grave and the playing of taps by a bugler from Camp Travis.\nThe Louis Jordan Flagpole.\nIn 1919, the American Legion post in Fredericksburg was renamed the Louis Jordan Post in his honor. In 1924, the residents of Fredericksburg raised a fund to erect a monument to Jordan in the new Texas Memorial Stadium. The monument consisted of a 100-foot high flagpole with a bronze tablet inscribed, \"In memory of First Lieut. Louis J. Jordan, University of Texas, 1911–15, who died in the service of his country in the great World war, 1914–1918. Erected by the citizens of Fredericksburg. Dedicated November 27, 1924, A.D.\" The Jordan memorial was unveiled on Thanksgiving Day 1924 before the Texas-Texas A&amp;M game and was the first monument to be placed in Memorial Stadium.\nThe flagpole remained in place at the south end of the stadium until it was removed in 1972 for the installation of a new scoreboard. In November 2000, at a dedication ceremony before the Texas-Texas A&amp;M football game, a replica of the flagpole memorial was installed in the southeast corner of the stadium. At the dedication, the honor guard wore World War I uniforms and a lone trumpeter from the marching band played taps in memory of Jordan's service. The memorial continues to be known as the Louis Jordan Flagpole. An exhibit featuring Jordan's 1914 letter sweater, part of his World War I uniform and his shrapnel-pierced diary is on display in a hall beneath the stadium's grandstand."

Smith formerly played with the Ottawa Senators and Calgary Flames in the National Hockey League (NHL). He is currently the Head Coach &amp; GM of the Trenton Golden Hawks of the OJHL.\nPlaying career.\nAfter playing 123 games over four seasons between 2000 and 2004 for the Wellington Dukes of the Ontario Provincial Junior Hockey League, Smith played three more seasons for the Lake Superior State Lakers. Undrafted, he signed as a free agent with the Ottawa Senators of the National Hockey League (NHL) on April 12, 2007, and decided to leave college a year early to pursue his dreams of playing in the NHL. After training camp, Smith was assigned to the Senators' top minor league affiliate, the Binghamton Senators. Smith was re-signed by the Senators to a one-year contract on July 29, 2009.\nOn February 12, 2010, after the trade of Alex Picard and an injury to Chris Campoli, Smith was called up to the Ottawa Senators. He made his NHL debut against the Detroit Red Wings on February 13, 2010, a 4–1 loss. He stayed on for the next game on February 14 against the New York Islanders. That was the final game before the Olympic break, which Ottawa won 4–3 after coming back from a 3–1 deficit. He was returned to Binghamton afterwards.\nOn July 13, 2010, Smith was re-signed by Ottawa to a one-year, two-way contract. He recorded his first NHL point when he assisted on a goal by Ottawa's Nick Foligno against the Atlanta Thrashers on March 3, 2011. In 2010-11, Smith was a member of the Binghamton Senators as they captured the 2011 Calder Cup championship in the American Hockey League. In 71 regular season games that season with Binghamton, he recorded 10 goals and 44 assists for 54 points which placed him 4th among AHL defenceman.\nSmith was signed by the Calgary Flames to a one-year, two-way contract worth $700,000 on July 12, 2011. Smith scored his first goal for the Flames on November 29, 2011, against Pekka Rinne of the Nashville Predators. On February 8, 2012, the Calgary Flames re-signed Smith to a two-year, one-way contract worth a total of $1.55 million, or $775,000 per year.\nOn December 8, 2013, the Flames placed Smith on waivers. After he cleared waivers the next day, the Flames assigned Smith to the Abbotsford Heat of the AHL.\nIn the following 2014–15 season, without an NHL offer on the table, Smith signed his first contract abroad as a free agent, agreeing to a one-year deal with Swiss club, ZSC Lions of the National League A. He appeared in 25 games with the Lions, registering 3 goals and 5 points.\nOn July 3, 2015, Smith returned to the NHL, signing a one-year, two-way contract with the Arizona Coyotes. Smith failed to make the roster of the parent club and was assigned to its AHL affiliate, the Springfield Falcons, for the remainder of the season.\nOn July 17, 2016, Smith signed a one-year deal with Croatian club, KHL Medveščak Zagreb of the KHL."

        "text": "Cricket is a popular sport in Sri Lanka. The country has eight grounds that have been used to host international cricket matches, and seven of them have hosted Test matches. However, the Colombo Cricket Club Ground and the Tyronne Fernando Stadium are no longer used for matches at international level, although they are still used for domestic matches and warm-up matches for visiting teams. The Galle International Stadium was destroyed in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, but was rebuilt and hosted international matches again in 2007. The Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium held its maiden One Day International in 2001, but was unable to host another until 2003 due to a legal problem.\nThe Hambantota and Pallekele cricket grounds were both newly constructed for 2011 Cricket World Cup, which Sri Lanka jointly hosted with India and Bangladesh. The R. Premadasa Stadium has also hosted world cup matches. The R. Premadasa Stadium was also one of the three grounds in Sri Lanka that hosted matches for the 1996 Cricket World Cup. The other two were the Asgiriya Stadium and the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground.\nThe R. Premadasa Stadium was the venue for the match in 1997 where Sri Lanka scored a record 952 runs for 6 wickets against India. Sri Lankan cricketer Mahela Jayawardene has scored a total of 2467 Test runs at the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, the most runs scored by a batsman in one ground. It is also the venue where he scored 374 runs, the highest score by a Sri Lankan batsman. The venue where the most Test wickets have been taken by a single bowler is also the Sinhalese Sports Club Ground, where 166 have been taken by Muttiah Muralitharan. The Asgiriya Stadium ranks second with 117 wickets, and is followed by the Galle International Stadium with 103 wickets. Both these records are also held by Muralitharan. Sanath Jayasuriya has scored 2514 ODI runs at the R. Premadasa Stadium, making it the venue which has the highest ODI runs by a single batsman. The largest non-cricket stadium in Sri Lanka is the 25,000-capacity Sugathadasa Stadium, which is used mostly for association football matches."

        "title": "List of international cricket centuries by Mahela Jayawardene",
        "text": "Mahela Jayawardene is a retired Sri Lankan cricketer and a former captain of the Sri Lanka national cricket team. He has been described as one of the best batsmen produced by the country. Jayawardene was the leading run-scorer for Sri Lanka in Tests, after fellow Sri Lankan Kumar Sangakkara surpassed him, and Mahela has scored 35 centuries. He has scored 19 centuries in his One Day International (ODI) career, and is the fourth-highest run-scorer for Sri Lanka. On 9 November 2014, he scored his 17th ODI century against India and also became only the 5th player to score 12,000 runs in One Day Internationals, after Sachin Tendulkar, Sanath Jayasuriya, Ricky Ponting &amp; teammate Kumar Sangakkara. He is the highest scorer for the country in Twenty20 International (T20I) matches as well, and has scored one century. Jayawardene was chosen as captain of the International Cricket Council's (ICC) World One Day International team and selected as Captain of the Year at the 2006 ICC Awards. He was recognized as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 2007, and was a member of the ICC World Test team the following year.\nJayawardene's debut Test match was against India in August 1997, in which the Sri Lankan team made a world record 952 runs for 6 wickets. He scored his maiden Test century in his fourth match, played in June 1998 against New Zealand. The 150 he scored against Bangladesh in September 2001 is the fastest Test century made by a Sri Lankan player. However, this innings came to an unusual end when he retired out just after reaching 150 runs. Jayawardene's best innings was made against South Africa in July 2006 when he scored 374 runs, surpassing Sanath Jayasuriya's record of 340 for the highest individual score by a Sri Lankan batsman. It is also the fourth-highest score in Test cricket, as well as part of the world's highest Test partnership—624 runs—which he established with teammate Kumar Sangakkara. Jayawardene has scored a total of 34 centuries during his career, the second highest number by a Sri Lankan player, after Kumar Sangakkara. He has scored more than 200 runs on seven of these occasions. This is the second-highest number of double centuries by a Sri Lankan player, behind Kumar Sangakkara. He is also one of only three players who have scored a triple century for Sri Lanka; the other two being Jayasuriya and Sangakkara.\nJayawardene made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe on 24 January 1998, and scored his first century a year later, against England on 23 January 1999. Although not as illustrious as his Test centuries, he has since made 19 ODI centuries for Sri Lanka. This is the fourth-highest number of centuries for Sri Lanka by a single player behind Jayasuriya's 28, Sangakkara's 21, and Dilshan's 20. On 10 June 2007, Jayawardene scored 107 runs for the Asia XI team, which he captained during the 2007 Afro-Asia Cup. Mahendra Singh Dhoni, who scored an unbeaten 139 in the same match, and Jayawardene are the only players who have scored a century for Asia XI. Jayawardene became the sixth player to score a century at a Cricket World Cup Final with an unbeaten 103 against India during the final match of the 2011 Cricket World Cup. However, Sri Lanka lost the match, making Jayawardene the first centurion in a lost cause at a World Cup final.\nJayawardene made his T20I debut against England on 15 June 2006, and scored his first century against Zimbabwe on 3 May 2010. Jayawardene was the fourth player to score a century in a T20I, and the first Sri Lankan to do so."

He played professional basketball in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) with the New York / New Jersey Nets, Denver Nuggets, and Milwaukee Bucks between 1975 and 1981. Hughes served as the interim head coach for the Los Angeles Clippers for 33 games in 2010. On July 4, 2015, he was fired from his position as an assistant coach with the Portland Trail Blazers.\nPlaying career.\nThe 6-foot-11 Hughes played college basketball at the University of Wisconsin from 1971 to 1974, averaging 15 points and 11 rebounds as a senior. His identical twin, Kerry, also 6-11, was also a starter on the Badgers. Hughes was selected by the Buffalo Braves in the third round (ninth pick) of the 1974 NBA draft; immediately, he played professionally in Italy during the 1974–75 season for Olimpia Milano. He spent the 1975–76 season with the New York Nets of the American Basketball Association (ABA), where he averaged eight points and nine rebounds and was named to the First Team ABA All-Rookie Team. The 1976 Nets team, which featured Julius Erving, Swen Nater, Larry Kenon and Brian Taylor, won the ABA championship.\nHughes spent two more seasons with the Nets after the franchise moved to the National Basketball Association (NBA). In July 1978, Hughes signed with the Denver Nuggets, where he played for two full seasons. Eight games into the 1980–81 NBA season, Hughes was traded to the Cleveland Cavaliers. He retired from the NBA at the end of the 1981 season, but continued to play professionally in Italy until 1989. During his ABA and NBA career, Hughes averaged 3.8 points and 5.6 rebounds per game, and had field goal and free throw percentages of 49.7% and 39.7%, respectively.\nCoaching career.\nHughes has worked as a scout and assistant coach with the NBA's Denver Nuggets, Milwaukee Bucks, Los Angeles Clippers, and Portland Trail Blazers.\nIn 2004, Hughes was diagnosed with prostate cancer, but the Clippers and Donald Sterling refused to cover the cost of his surgery. Several Clippers players, including Corey Maggette, Chris Kaman, Marko Jarić and Elton Brand, chipped in to pay for Hughes' treatment. It turned out that the cancer was more advanced than previously thought and about to metastasize. The cost of the surgery was estimated by Hughes to be at least $70,000.\nOn February 4, 2010, Hughes replaced Mike Dunleavy, Sr. as the head coach of the Los Angeles Clippers. On April 15, 2010, Hughes was released from his duties as interim head coach after going 8–25.\nOn August 17, 2012, Hughes was named as an assistant coach for the Portland Trail Blazers. On July 4, 2015, it was reported that Kim Hughes was relieved of his duties as assistant coach of the Portland Trail Blazers due to circumstances related to media statements and free agency."

        "text": "Detroit is a popular city for cycling. It is flat with an extensive road network with a number of recreational and competitive opportunities and is, according to cycling advocate David Byrne, one of the top eight biking cities in the world. The city has invested in greenways and bike lanes and other bicycle-friendly infrastructure. Bike rental is available from the riverfront and tours of the city's architecture can be booked.\nThe city has a strong cycling heritage, and first embraced cycling during the \"golden age\" of the 1890s.\nInfrastructure.\nOn-road Infrastructure.\nDetroit is an excellent city for cycling with flat terrain and an extensive but often virtually traffic free road network; according to David Byrne it is one of the top eight biking cities in the world. The city has invested in greenways and bike lanes and has a number of plans to further develop the cycling infrastructure.\nThe city of Detroit installed its first bike lanes along portions of Atwater Street as part of the Renaissance Center redesign of 2002/2003. The Atwater plans were never fully realized.\nAs of early 2012, there are over 43 miles of bike lanes in Detroit, including 6 miles on Belle Isle Park and about 20 miles throughout Southwest Detroit; there are also in-park shared-use paths at Rouge Park, Palmer Park, Patton Park and throughout the city parks in the Lafayette-Elmwood neighborhoods. The Dequindre Cut, a major greenway designed for cycling, links to the Detroit International Riverfront which also allows cycling along the waterfront. Portions of the Conner Creek Greenway on Detroit's east side are also completed.\nThough still in the early planning stages, United States Bicycle Routes 25, 30, and 36 provide connection through Detroit.\nThe 'Detroit Non-Motorized Master Plan' calls for 400 miles of bike lanes primarily through road diets. The plan's implementation was started in summer 2009 with initial projects completed in 2010.\nThe Detroit Health and Wellness Promotion Department (DHWP) is leading the effort to educate the community and elected officials on the value of Complete streets. Groups are working to bring a Complete Streets ordinance before the Detroit City Council by summer 2012.\nThe Adventure Cycling Association together with Michigan Trails, Greenways Alliance and the Michigan Historic Trails Commission has developed a new 400-mile spur through Detroit to the existing 2,100-mile 'Underground Railroad Bicycle Route' which follows historic Underground Railroad sites from Mobile, Alabama to Owen Sound, Ontario in Canada. The tour map from Oberlin, Ohio to Marine City, Michigan via Detroit is completed. A shorter route just within Detroit has been developed and a brochure is planned.\nTrails and greenways.\nThe 'Detroit Greenway Network' is currently under development and would create a citywide network of greenways encompassing more than 70 miles of greenways and use additional miles of bike lanes (based on the City's non-motorized plan) for on-road connections. This Network would also provide connections to other neighboring and regional efforts.\nBikes and transit.\nBuses on the city's main transit systems, DDOT and SMART, are equipped with bike racks capable of holding two bicycles. Maximum tire width is limited to about 2.4 inches, so these racks cannot be used by semi-fat and fat bikes with inflated tires. The Detroit People Mover and QLINE allow bicycles to be brought onto their trains.\nInternational crossings.\nThere is no current means for bicycling between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, Canada across the Detroit River. The Ambassador Bridge was open to bicycles and pedestrians from its opening in 1929 but was closed in 2001. The Detroit-Windsor Tunnel does not allow bicycles either, though bicycles can be brought on Transit Windsor's Tunnel Bus.\nThe new Gordie Howe International Bridge, under construction with a projected 2025 opening, is being designed with a separated trail that will be open to bicyclists and pedestrians.\nRecreational and competitive facilities.\nThe Michigan Mountain Biking Association and Student Conservation Association developed a hiking/mountain bike trail in Rouge Park on Detroit's west side. This 3-mile trail is beginner to intermediate singletrack.\nThe Detroit Fitness Foundation built the Lexus Velodrome at Detroit's Tolan Park in 2017 which opened to the public in January 2018. The outdoor Dorais Velodrome is no longer suitable for track racing.\nBike sharing.\nDetroit has a public bicycle sharing system called MoGo, which launched in May 2017. Prior to MoGo, there was Zagster bike sharing within the downtown area that was limited to employees of Quicken Loans and their affiliated companies.\nProposed developments.\nThe following three greenway projects would link the Detroit International Riverfront through Corktown and Mexican Town to connect to the River Rouge and from there up-river to the River Rouge Park and The Henry Ford.\nOther proposals include:\nHistory.\nVelocipedes preceded highwheeler and safety bicycles on Detroit's streets. Ben Fletcher rode the first velocipede in Detroit on December 18, 1868. Velocipedes were \"in common use\" by 1875.\nThe Detroit Bicycle Club was formed in 1879 when \"only a few persons in Detroit rode.\" By 1890, the club merged with the Meteor Bicycle Club and the Star Bicycle Club to become the Detroit Wheelmen. The Unique Cycling Club (1894 to 1911) was the women's equivalent to the Wheelmen and often shared their clubhouse.\nIn 1891, the League of American Wheelmen held their annual meeting on Detroit's Belle Isle.\nIn 1896, the Detroit Wheelmen boasted 450 members and built a $40,000 clubhouse near Grand Circus Park. Famous Detroit Wheelmen include John F. Dodge, Horace E. Dodge, William E. Metzger, Truman H. Newberry, Horatio Earle, Tom Cooper (driver) and Edward N. Hines.\nAlso in 1896, Henry Ford bicycled behind as Charles Brady King drove the first gasoline automobile in Detroit. Ford drove his first car, called the Quadricycle, just 3 months later. His vehicle was built using various bicycle components, including four bicycle wheels.\nDetroit's bicycle shop owners, manufacturers, racers, and enthusiasts became the city's automobile pioneers.\nWolverine Sports Club.\nThe Wolverine Sports Club (WSC) originated in 1937 as a touring and racing club. The club's headquarters became Mike Walden's Continental Bike Shop in Detroit, and followed the shop's moves ending up in Hazel Park. In 1949, a board of directors was established to guide the club philosophically. Other sports that were a part of the club at this time were: hockey, boxing, track and field, speedskating, and cross country skiing. In 1950 WSC merged with the Berkley Speedskating Club and grew considerably in size. In 1972, cross-country skiing was added as a major sport and the club assumed its current form and became known as the Wolverine Sports Club. WSC was voted the United States Cycling Federation Club of the Year in 1991. Up to that time 28% of all National medal winners came from WSC. In 1997 the WSC became a non-profit 501(c)(3) corporation."

This was the nation's eighth appearance in the Winter Olympic Games since its debut in 1976. The San Marino delegation consisted of a single competitor, the alpine skier Marino Cardelli, who finished 80th in his only event.\nBackground.\nSan Marino first entered Olympic competition at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome. The nation did not enter a Winter Olympic Games until Innsbruck in 1976. Excepting the 1980 and 1998 Winter Olympics they have participated in every edition of the Winter Olympics since, making Vancouver the nation's eighth Winter Olympics appearance. Like the 2006 Olympics, the Sammarinesi delegation consisted of a single athlete, Marino Cardelli, returning for his second consecutive Olympics. Cardelli was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, while Gian Luca Borgagni, the Chef de Mission for the delegation, was selected for the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nSan Marino qualified one athlete for alpine skiing. Marino Cardelli was 22 years old at the time of the Vancouver Olympics. His only event in Vancouver was the giant slalom held on 23 February. Cardelli posted a first run time of 1 minute and 40 seconds, over 23 seconds behind the leader. He stated, “My ankle is not very good and my form is not the best, But for me, arriving is a very special thing.” Later that day, his second run time was 1 minute and 44 seconds, 24 seconds behind the lap's fastest skier. His combined time of 3 minutes and 25 seconds placed him in 80th position, out of 81 competitors who finished both runs."

        "text": "The Kingston Hawthorn Cricket Club is an Australian cricket club based at Walter Galt Reserve, situated in Parkdale, Victoria. They play in Victorian Premier Cricket, the highest competition in the state.\nHistory.\nThe club was originally known as East Melbourne. It shared dominance of Melbourne cricket with its neighbour, the Melbourne Cricket Club. East Melbourne won the Victorian cricket competition 20 times and was runner-up another 20 times. When the Victorian Railways took over the East Melbourne Oval for expansion to its railyards the club amalgamated with Hawthorn (Sub-District) in 1921 and moved to Glenferrie Oval, playing as Hawthorn-East Melbourne.\nIn the 1980s, the club was hampered by the success of its co-tenant, the Hawthorn Football Club, and being unable to use the oval until after the football club's finals campaign had finished, the cricket club agreed with financial assistance to relocate. In 1989, it moved to Central Reserve, Waverley and became known as Hawthorn Waverley, after the former Waverley Cricket Club amalgamated with the Dandenong Cricket Club at Dandenong.\nThe club amalgamated with Monash University (Sub-District) in 2003 and moved to the Monash University Sports Complex in Clayton in 2004, changing its name to Hawthorn-Monash University.\nThe club's Monash University ground was taken over during 2015 by a new residential development on the campus. The club initially announced in late 2014 that it would amalgamate with the premier Dandenong Cricket Club from the 2015–16 season, and likely be based at Dandenong's Shepley Oval; but the merger collapsed in March 2015 when the clubs were unable to agree on terms. Consequently, the club instead merged with the sub-district Kingston Saints Cricket Club to form the Kingston Hawthorn Cricket Club, and moved to Kingston's Walter Galt Reserve in Parkdale.\nPremierships.\nDistrict era: 1906-2002\nFirst grade premierships as East Melbourne, Hawthorn East Melbourne or Hawthorn Waverley:"

        "text": "The men's figure skating competition at the 1956 Winter Olympics took place at the Olympic Ice Stadium in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The competition was held on 29 January and 1 February 1956. Sixteen men from eleven countries participated in the competition. The event was dominated by the American skaters who swept the medals. Hayes Jenkins and his brother, David Jenkins, won gold and bronze respectively.\nCompetition.\nThe event was held outdoors at the Ice Stadium in Cortina d'Ampezzo, the host city for the Games. This would be the last time that the figure skating events were held outdoors at an Olympic Games. The Ice Stadium was the focal point of the Games. It was used not only for figure skating but also for the opening and closing ceremonies. The stadium was built to accommodate 6,000–7,000 people. Temporary seating was added for the figure skating competition that swelled the stadium's capacity to 14,000 people. The ladies' competition was the first figure skating event held at the Games. It was followed by the men's competition and then the pairs. Ice dancing was not contested as it had yet to become an Olympic sport in 1956.\nThe competition was broken down into two disciplines. The first was a compulsory figures competition, which counted for 60% of the score. This was held on 29 January under near-perfect ice conditions. After a nervous start on the first figure, Hayes Jenkins recovered to hold a narrow lead over his teammate Ronald Robertson at the end of the day, with David Jenkins only slightly behind.\nThe second discipline was a free skating program, which counted for 40% of the final score. This final program was performed on 1 February. Due to the very cold weather, the ice was extremely hard, causing some of the competitors to skate cautiously. Hayes Jenkins' program, skated to the music \"Scheherazade\", included jumps and spins blended with connecting steps and choreography. Robertson's program emphasized showmanship with crowd-pleasing jumps and spins, but had less connecting choreography. Robertson narrowly won the free skating with six first places, but Hayes Jenkins' lead from the compulsory figures held up to give him the gold medal. David Jenkins struggled with the hard ice and fell twice in his program, but held his position after the figures to take the bronze medal.\nDavid Jenkins went on to win the gold medal in the men's competition at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley. Hayes Jenkins retired from competitive skating after the 1956 season, and later married Carol Heiss who was the women's silver medalist at the 1956 Games and gold medalist at the 1960 Games.\nResults.\nSource:"

        "text": "The skeleton tarantula, Ephebopus murinus, is a species of spider belonging to the family Theraphosidae (tarantulas), sub-family Aviculariinae. A New World species, it is native to several South American countries. Its common name is derived from the skeleton-like markings on its legs.\nTaxonomy.\nThe species was first described by Charles Athanase Walckenaer in 1837 as \"Mygale murina\".\nIn 1892, Eugène Simon placed it in his genus \"Ephebopus\". Frederick Octavius Pickard-Cambridge described it as \"Santaremia pococki\" in 1896 (creating a new genus). Later Reginald Innes Pocock (1903) synonymised \"S. pococki\" with \"E. murinus\", which remains the species' accepted scientific name to date.\nThe generic name, \"Ephebopus\" is derived from the Greek meaning \"youth(ful)\" plus \"foot\", and the specific name, \"murinus\" is from the Latin meaning \"mouse-colored\".\nDescription.\nThe adult \"E. murinus\" usually grows to a leg span of about 11–12 cm (4.5 inches), though females can grow as large as 15 cm (6 inches).\nThe legs are black, the abdomen is small and brown, and the carapace is coffee colored or golden. The leg striping is similar to that of \"Aphonopelma seemani\", but more yellowish in colour.\nHabitat and distribution.\n\"E. murinus\" is a terrestrial, semi-fossorial, lowland forest-dwelling species native to northern Brazil, French Guiana, and Suriname.\nBehavior.\nUnlike most members of the subfamily Aviculariinae, which are arboreal, \"E. murinus\" lives mainly on or near the forest floor, where it will build a heavily webbed burrow beneath the topsoil or amongst branches, rocks, and other forest floor debris.\nAs a defense against potential predators, and in common with many other New World tarantulas, the species of the genus \"Ephebopus\" will brush urticating hairs from their bodies. Uniquely, rather than being located on the abdomen, \"Ephebopus\" urticating hairs are located on the spider's palps - on the medial side of the palpal femora; the spider sheds these hairs by rubbing the palp against the chelicerae.\n\"E. murinus\" is also a fast and aggressive species, and will readily rise up and present its fangs to a potential predator.\nDiet.\nIn common with most terrestrial tarantula species, \"Ephobopus murinus\" feeds on ground-dwelling insects, worms and small mammals."

The award is granted to the head coach voted to be the most successful that season by members of the Atlantic Coast Sports Media Association, and since the 2012–13 season has also been awarded in separate voting by the league's coaches. The award was first given following the 1953–54 season, the first year of the conference's existence, to Everett Case of NC State. The first winner of the coaches' award was Jim Larrañaga of Miami (FL) in 2013.\nDean Smith of North Carolina has won the most awards with eight, followed by Mike Krzyzewski of Duke, with five, and currently active coach Tony Bennett of Virginia, with four. Fourteen coaches in total have won the award more than once. Fourteen coaches have also won the award in the same season that they have also won a National Coach of the Year award; of those, only Krzyzewski and Smith have achieved the feat three times. Five coaches have won during the same season that they have coached a team that won the NCAA Tournament Championship: Tony Bennett, Frank McGuire, Norm Sloan, Dean Smith, and Gary Williams. McGuire is the only head coach to win the award at two different schools (North Carolina and South Carolina).\nEach of the original (1953) ACC members have had at least one of their coaches win the award. Among schools that joined the ACC before 2013, Boston College is the only one that has never had a winning coach. Thirty-one different coaches from twelve schools have received the award. North Carolina has the most ACC Coach of the Year awards with twelve, while its in-state rival, Duke, is second with ten. Each school of Tobacco Road (including NC State and Wake Forest) has won at least seven awards, as has Virginia with eight."

        "text": "The Princeton Tigers women's ice hockey team represents Princeton University in the ECAC Hockey conference in the NCAA Division I women's ice hockey. They play at the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. In the 2019-2020 season, they won their first ECAC championship, defeating #1 ranked Cornell by a score of 3-2 in overtime.\nHistory.\nOn November 24, 1979, the Princeton Tigers played their first varsity game against the University of Pennsylvania. In winter of 1982, Princeton would snap the Cornell Big Red women's ice hockey program's string of six straight Ivy League titles and go on to win Ivy League championships in 1983 and 1984 under head coach Bill Quackenbush.\nFormer Princeton player and assistant coach Laura Halldorson would coach the Minnesota Golden Gophers women's ice hockey program to the 2004 NCAA title.\nOn February 26, 2010, Princeton would be part of NCAA ice hockey history. With a 5-1 loss to the Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey program, Harvard coach Katey Stone became women's college hockey's all-time winningest coach, surpassing former Princeton player and Minnesota head coach Laura Halldorson.\nOn December 31, 2010, Rachel Weber made 24 saves as the Tigers upset the fifth ranked Boston College Eagles by a 3-0 margin. It was Weber's third shutout in four games and her goals against average for the season was lowered to 1.93 In three games played between January 3 and 8, 2011, Rachel Weber earned three victories and allowed only one goal. On January 3, she defeated Quinnipiac by a 3-0 tally and shutout Clarkson by a 2-0 score on January 7. The following day, she gave up her only goal of the week in a 3-1 win over St. Lawrence. Her shutout streak spanned six games and lasted 289:43. She is now the owner of the longest shutout streak in ECAC history and the fourth longest in NCAA Division I since the 2000-01 season.\n2019-2020 was a historic season for the Tigers. The team finished with a program-best 26 wins. Ranked 6th and seeded second, they played in and won the ECAC championship tournament for the first time. Carly Bullock scored 30 goals, only the fifth player in program history to accomplish the feat. She was named the national Player of the Month in February 2020 for scoring 13 goals in 9 games. Her 30th goal came in the ECAC championship game against Cornell, when she evened the score at 2-2. The Tigers would go on to win in overtime, 3-2, with Mariah Koepple scoring the winning goal, from assists by Shannon Griffin and Sharon Frankel. Forward Sarah Fillier was selected as ECAC tournament Most Outstanding Player, after earning points in every game. The Tigers arrived in the championship game after beating Clarkson by a score of 5-1. The Tigers were scheduled to play Northeastern in the quarterfinals for the NCAA tournament when the event was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, the impact of the pandemic would wipe out the 2020-21 season for all Ivy League teams. Although the ECAC Conference, the member conference for Ivy League women's ice hockey teams, held a season in 2020-21, Princeton, and all other Ivy League teams did not participate.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nAwards and honors.\nPrinecton's Patty Kazmaier Award.\nOf note, the Tigers also have their own Patty Kazmaier Award. Unlike the NCAA award, this award is given annually to a senior member of the women's hockey team. The criteria includes making the greatest contribution to the program during her career and best exemplifying characteristics such as: loyalty and devotion to Princeton Women's Hockey and determination and perseverance under adverse conditions"

Typically, the match location switches between Oxford and Cambridge, though recently Cambridge have hosted matches in London. Boxers who compete in the Varsity Match are traditionally awarded a Full Blue by the Cambridge University Men's Blues Committee if they win individually or the team wins. Other boxers, such as those having been selected for a second Varsity Match, can be awarded a Blue at the discretion of the committee.\nIn the 2005 Varsity Match, Kaleen Love of Oxford defeated Catherine Tubb of Cambridge in the first women's varsity boxing bout. Catherine Tubb had previously beaten Kaleen at the BUSA championships held in December 2004. Both were awarded Extraordinary Full Blues for their athletic accomplishments. In recent years, two more Extraordinary Full Blues have been awarded to Sarah Burden and Heley Matthews. Chris Webb remains the only boxer in history to have represented Cambridge in the Varsity match 4 times, and won all 4 bouts.\nIn both the 2005 and 2009 Varsity Matches, CUABC beat OUABC by the maximum 9-0 margin. Cambridge University Amateur Boxing Club (CUABC) remains the only side to have achieved this feat since the number of bouts was increased to 9 in the 1950s.\nOn 1 March 2015 CUABC broke OUABC's five year winning streak in the Varsity Match, winning 6-3.\nThe running total for the Men's Varsity Match is 55-54 in CUABC's favour as of 2020 after a three year winning streak by the Cambridge boxers.\nCUABC trains at University of Cambridge Sports Centre."

        "title": "Downtown Commercial District (Bowling Green, Kentucky)",
        "text": "History.\nThe Civil War in Downtown Bowling Green.\nThe Civil War is an integral part of the history of Bowling Green and its downtown commercial district. Due to Bowling Green's strategic location along the Barren River, and its regional economic and industrial power, it was a coveted city by both the Confederates and the Union. Kentucky was a hotly contested state due to its pro-slavery policies, but refusal to secede. Furthermore, its location right on the border between the Confederacy and the Union made it an instant war zone. Early in the war, a large Confederate force marched into downtown Bowling Green and began fortifying the city. Eventually, over 20,000 Confederate soldiers arrived at the downtown train depot and garrisoned the city. The soldiers fortified hills on the edge of downtown, and spent a great deal of time ensuring the city would not fall to Union invaders. Soldiers even converted Hobson Grove, a mansion at the edge of downtown, into a fort with a large storage of ammunition, weapons, and munitions for troops. The occupying Confederate forces, so confident in the town's defenses, dubbed it \"The Gibraltar of the West\". Businesses, such as taverns, restaurants, and even brothels catered to the occupying forces, who spent their wages on food, drink, and comfort in these downtown establishments. Downtown Bowling Green was eventually made into the Confederate Capitol of Kentucky, despite the local populations pro-Union preference, and a Confederate government was established and operated out of the downtown district. Unfortunately for the rebels, Union victories at Mill Springs and Columbus forced the Confederates to retreat from the town, as they would have been surrounded if they had stayed. The Confederates destroyed much of downtown's infrastructure as they left, dealing a great blow to the local economy in the process. Union troops entered the town after the Confederates left in 1862, and they remained there for the rest of the war. The Civil War, though it destroyed much of the downtown's infrastructure and economy, eventually paved the way for the town to rebuild, and gave the town a metaphorical \"blank slate\" to start anew.\nThe Post-War Decades.\nAfter the aforementioned destruction of industry, such as the railroad tracks, buildings of potential military relevance, and munitions storages, downtown Bowling Green needed to rebuild. Residents came together, and in conjunction with the industrial revolution that swept the United States, quickly rebuilt and expanded upon the economy and infrastructure of downtown. Around this time, a new train depot was built, the railroads were repaired, and new businesses sprung up after the expansion of the Louisville-Nashville railroad during the war years. Furthermore, more railroad routes that passed through Bowling Green were added to the existing Louisville-Nashville routes, which increased Bowling Green's reputation as a railroad hub. Now that civilians were riding the railroads again, they needed places to stop and rest. Bowling Green was the perfect place for this to occur, and inns and places of recreation for travelers passing by sprung up all over downtown Bowling Green. Furthermore, the economic expansion of Bowling Green was even more exaggerated with the arrival of more and more Americans traveling West from East coast cities. Between the end of the war and the turn of the century, downtown Bowling Green experienced an economic boom that powered it in to being the third largest city in Kentucky, and the unquestioned regional capitol of South-central Kentucky. Many of the buildings constructed during this time period remain in downtown today, and are still important to the local business market and economy.\nWestern Kentucky University.\nWestern Kentucky University is a central part of downtown Bowling Green's continued success and growth in the 20th and 21st centuries. Formerly known as the Southern Normal School, Western Kentucky University was donated to the state and renamed to its current moniker in 1906 by its president, Henry Hardin Cherry. Western Kentucky University is now one of the largest universities in Kentucky, behind only the University of Louisville and the University of Kentucky in size. As the size of the university grew rapidly during the 20th century, it attracted more and more visitors and new residents to downtown Bowling Green. Located just blocks from the center of downtown, many restaurants, shops, and bars opened to cater to the needs of the thousands of college students that filled the streets of downtown every fall and spring. In more recent years, Western Kentucky University has even began to create classroom spaces in the middle of downtown. The business school recently opened a 5,000 square foot classroom space right next to Fountain Square, the central part of downtown. The impact of Western Kentucky University on the local economy cannot be understated. Alongside the businesses that have opened to cater to college students, downtown banks and other financial institutions have benefitted from the influx of college students seeking the services needed to navigate college life. Today, downtown and campus are nearly adjacent, with more and more integration occurring each and every year.\nPresent-Day Downtown.\nHistoric Buildings.\nThe Downtown Commercial District in Bowling Green, Kentucky is a historic district that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. In 1979, it included 113 buildings deemed to contribute to the historic character of the area.\nA few of the district's buildings are:\n The district was listed as part of a review of historic resources in Warren County.\nNotable Buildings.\nSome of the more important buildings in downtown Bowling Green, both economically and aesthetically, include (but are not limited to):"

This period also marked the conclusion of the 2011 Rugby World Cup qualifying process, as well as the beginning of the European Nations Cup.\nThe series saw Ireland play their first Test matches at the Aviva Stadium, which replaces Lansdowne Road as the side's long-term home and ends the temporary arrangement with the Gaelic Athletic Association which allowed the team to play home matches at Croke Park. The series also marked the first time that two Southern Hemisphere nations simultaneously attempted Grand Slam tours of all four Home Nations, with both New Zealand and South Africa playing all four countries.

The Afghanistan National Olympic Committee, established in 1935 and recognised by the International Olympic Committee in 1936, is the National Olympic Committee for Afghanistan.\nAfghanistan was one of the five founding members of the Asian Games Federation on 13 February 1949, in New Delhi; the organisation was disbanded on 26 November 1981 and replaced by the Olympic Council of Asia.\nMembership of Olympic Council of Asia.\nAfghanistan is a member of the Central Asian Zone of the Olympic Council of Asia, the governing body of all the sports in Asia, recognised by the International Olympic Committee as the continental association of Asia. It was a member of the South Asian Zone, where Afghanistan participated in the South Asian Games, from 2004 to 2016.\nThe OCA organises five major continental-level multi-sport events: the Asian Summer Games (which are commonly known as the Asian Games), Asian Winter Games, Asian Indoor-Martial Arts Games, Asian Beach Games, and Asian Youth Games. Before 2009, Indoor and Martial Arts were two separate events for indoor and martial arts sports respectively. However, the OCA has since amalgamated them into a single event, the Asian Indoor-Martial Arts Games, which will be debuted in 2013 in Incheon, South Korea. As a member of OCA, Afghanistan is privileged to participate in all these multi-sport events.\nAsian Games.\nAfghanistan has competed in the Asian Games since the inaugural edition of the Games in 1951 in New Delhi. On 26 September 1996, the Taliban took over Kabul and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. Under the Taliban regime all types of sporting activities were deprecated, as according to the Taliban, most of them were against the teachings of Islam and Islamic law. Many stadiums, like Ghazi Stadium of Kabul, were either destroyed or converted into venues for public executions and punishments. Women were banned from taking part in any type of sport; male athletes were allowed to participate in a few sports, but were forced to wear long sleeves, trousers and beards. Following such incidents and discrimination against women, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee and barred them from taking part in the Olympic Games.\nA few months before the 2000 Summer Olympics, the IOC offered the Afghanistan National Olympic Committee the opportunity to send a contingent to the Games without the Taliban flag. The Committee declined to take part on this condition.\nAfghanistan did not send a delegation to the 1998 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand, due to economic difficulties. Laws implemented by the Taliban government also made it impossible for Afghan athletes to compete. For example, the International Boxing Association (AIBA) does not allow players to have beards and mustaches, but Afghan males were forbidden to cut their facial hair. Afghanistan returned to the Asian Games after the fall of the Taliban government in the midst of an ongoing war. In June 2003, the IOC lifted the suspension imposed on Afghanistan during the 115th IOC Session in Prague.\nAfghanistan status unclear for the future participation since brought under the political turmoil.\nAsian Beach Games.\nAfghanistan has competed in both the editions of the Asian Beach Games. In the 2008 Asian Beach Games, Afghanistan won two medals, a gold and a bronze. In the 2010 Asian Beach Games in Muscat, no Afghan athletes won any medals.\nAsian Youth Games.\nThe First Asian Youth Games were held in Singapore from 29 June 2009 to 7 July 2009 and featured over 90 sporting events. Afghanistan did not send its delegation to the Games."

        "title": "Boxing for Cuba",
        "text": "Boxing for Cuba: An Immigrant’s Story of Despair, Endurance, and Redemption is the memoir of Guillermo (“Bill”) Vicente Vidal published by Ghost Road Press in November 2007. The book documents the Vidal family as they flee from Cuba in the 1960s and eventually establish a home in Colorado. After leaving Cuba in 1961 through Operation Peter Pan, Bill Vidal and his two brothers were taken to an orphanage in Pueblo, Colorado. Vidal served as mayor of the City of Denver, Colorado from January to July, 2011.\nBackground.\nBorn in 1951 in Camagüey, Cuba, Guillermo (“Bill”) spent the first 8 years of his life living a comfortable life with his parents—Marta Teresa Ramos Almendros and Roberto Emiliano Vidal—and twin older brothers – Roberto (“Bob”) and Juan Antonio (“John”). Soon after Fidel Castro overthrew Batista in 1959, the Vidal family began to observe a devastating situation and began to worry that their family was in danger. So, in an attempt to keep the family safe and together Marta and Roberto sent their three sons to America in 1961 as part of the Pedro Pan project with the intention of joining them soon in Miami. By 1961 the Pedro Pan project had run out of foster families, so Vidal and his two older brothers were sent to the Sacred Heart Orphanage in Pueblo, Colorado. After spending three years at Sacred Heart, Marta and Roberto finally escaped Cuba and reunited the family in Littleton, Colorado. The family succeeded despite the challenges of assimilation, discrimination, and family turbulence. By 1969 all five family members were taking classes at the University of Colorado Denver: Roberto Senior working towards a master's degree in Education, Marta Teresa taking art classes to teach elementary art, Bob studying political science, John studying speech and drama, and Bill studying engineering. After graduating from CU Denver, Bill began working as an engineer for the Colorado Department of Transportation, eventually being appointed as executive director of the department by Governor Roy Romer in 1994. Vidal was appointed as Manager of Public Works and Deputy Mayor by Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper in 2003.\nIn January 2011, Vidal assumed the duties of mayor of the City of Denver, Colorado, after the current mayor, John Hickenlooper resigned to assume the duties of governor of Colorado.\nSummary.\nThe book begins with Vidal detailing his early childhood. Vidal discusses the turbulent marriage of his parents as well as the political turmoil when Castro overthrew Batista. He details his close relationship with his two brothers, Roberto and Juan Antonio, and the family’s relatively comfortable life in Camaguey in the 1950s. In the early sections of the book Vidal also takes the reader through the early life of his parents and the beginnings of a turbulent marriage, detailing his mother’s depression and destructive behavior as well as his father’s excessive desire for success.\nVidal remembers the first days of Castro’s regime: watching Castro ride through the streets of a nearby town on a tank and being lifted by his parents to touch Castro’s hand. After those early days though, Vidal recounts how his life drastically changed. He narrates how soon people began to live in fear of Castro’s army and his spies, some of whom where neighbors or close friends of the Vidal’s. In September 1961, Marta and Roberto took their three boys to Havana, Cuba, in order to send their sons to the United States for safety. The Vidal boys left communist Cuba on September 29, 1961, with other Cuban children seeking exile through Operation Pedro Pan. Upon arrival in Miami, the Vidal boys expected to be picked up by family members who had already escaped Cuba and were living in Miami, but when no one arrived the three were taken to a temporary housing camp. Eventually the boys were moved to Sacred Heart Orphanage in Pueblo, Colorado. En route to Colorado the boys met Robert F. Kennedy, U.S. Attorney General at the time. In the span of two years, 10-year-old Vidal had met two of the most influential men of the time.\nVidal’s life at Sacred Heart Orphanage was plagued with fear of the harsh treatment of its caretaker and older boys, as well as the challenges of learning English and adjusting to the oddities of American culture. In their three years at Sacred Heart, the Vidal boys seemed to completely shed their Cuban heritage and become “real” Americans, even adopting the very American names “Bill,” “John,” and “Bob.” Not knowing when, if at all, their parents would ever escape Cuba to retrieve them, the boys adjusted as best they could to their new life in Pueblo.\nOn April 11, 1964, the Vidal family was reunited after Marta and Roberto emigrated to Mexico and eventually the United States. The family relocated to Littleton, Colorado and then later moved into the city of Denver. Though free from the oppression and fear of Castro’s regime, the Vidal family faced innumerable challenges in their new lives in America. The family struggled financially and they were often the victims of hate and discrimination. Moreover, Marta and Roberto's marriage had greatly deteriorated adding to their erratic behavior. Vidal recounts his adolescence as an extremely turbulent time.\nDespite domestic hardship the Vidal family was successful – each member of the family took classes at the University of Colorado at Denver. After receiving his degree in engineering Bill went on to work for the Colorado Department of Transportation. He married his high school sweetheart, Christine, and together they had a boy and adopted two girls. Though he flourished professionally Vidal continued to struggle with his relationship with his parents and eventually in his marriage as well. Eventually Bill and Christine divorced. Years later Vidal remarried Gabriela, a Chilean immigrant also working for CDOT.\nVidal credits Gabriela with inspiring him to reconnect with his family and his heritage. It is she who encourages him to return to Cuba in 2001 to try to face and understand his past. The book ends with Vidal returning to his childhood home to try to make sense of his life, and how very different it would be if he had not left as a 10-year-old boy.\nReception.\nThe memoir was well received upon its publication in 2007. Several have endorsed the book including, Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper, Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior Ken Salazar, and former President Bill Clinton. Vidal has spoken to many media outlets about \"Boxing for Cuba\" and has most recently been interviewed about the connection between his escape from Cuba via the Pedro Pan Project and the initiative to bring Haitian orphans to the United States after the 2010 Haiti earthquake in January."

        "text": "The closing ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics took place on February 28, 2010, beginning at 5:30 pm PST (01:30 UTC, March 1) at BC Place Stadium in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. It was the first Olympic Closing Ceremony held in an indoor venue since the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo.\nProgram.\nThe production's director David Atkins previously directed the Sydney 2000 Olympic and the 2006 Doha Asian Games ceremonies. The choreographer for the finale was Jean Grand-Maître, artistic director of the Alberta Ballet.\nPre-ceremony activities.\nA joke was made about the hydraulic system failure with the indoor cauldron in the opening ceremony. Electrical sparks, a fake chicken and feathers shot out of the hole where the fourth arm would have risen. After this, Québécois clown and mime Yves Dagenais, dressed in workmen's clothing, climbed out of the hole, plugged two long cords together, and pretended to pull the fourth pillar out as it emerged. Dagenais then \"summoned\" Catriona Le May Doan (who appeared from underneath the stage via an elevated trap door), holding a lit torch in her hand. She looked around, acting bewildered, and then saw Dagenais, and he happily presented to her the emerging fourth pillar. He then wiped his brow with a red handkerchief to signify a job well done and walked off the stage. After the pillar was in place, Le May Doan, who had been left out of the lighting of the cauldron in the opening ceremony because of the failure, saluted the audience by holding her torch in the air, walked over toward the pillar and was finally able to light the cauldron, to great fanfare from the audience. With the entire cauldron lit, Le May Doan saluted the audience again and then descended back underneath the stage.\nA mass of white-clad high school students with snowboards came out and surrounded the cauldron while the band Inward Eye gave a performance, with the Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra behind them. This took place during the countdown, which was followed by the release of fireworks in BC Place. After the countdown and fireworks, the anthem cast created the words Strong and Free followed by a maple leaf and then a circle surrounding the cauldron to welcome the official party.\nChief Leonard Andrew of the Lil'wat, Chief Ernie Campbell of the Musqueam, Chief Bill Williams of the Squamish, and Chief Justin George of the Tsleil-Waututh were welcomed. Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister of Canada and IOC president Jacques Rogge were then introduced.\nNational anthem.\nA bilingual rendition of the Canadian national anthem \"O Canada\" was sung by the Anthem Cast, The Vancouver Youth Symphony Orchestra, &amp; Inward Eye.\nEntrance of the flag bearers and the parade of the athletes.\nThe flag bearers for the participating nations then entered the stadium at the same time, making a ring around the Olympic Cauldron. Following tradition, the athletes entered the stadium in no particular order to parade around the Olympic Cauldron at the centre of the stadium, before filing out to take their reserved front row seats.\nMusical portion.\nThree musicians, Eva Avila, Nikki Yanofsky, and Derek Miller, each on an elevated, lighted column that rose out of the stadium floor, sang the song \"Let's Have a Party\" in French and English.\nMedal ceremony.\nAs with tradition, the medals to one of the marquee events of the Winter Games – men's 50 km classical cross-country – were presented during the closing ceremony. The race was held earlier that day in Whistler Olympic Park. The medals were given by Gerhard Heiberg, IOC member for Norway and member of the Executive Commission of the IOC. The flowers were given by the Ski Federation.\nRecognitions.\nTwo new members of the IOC, Angela Ruggiero (USA) and Adam Pengilly (UK), were announced. The volunteers who made the games possible were also recognized.\nGreek national anthem.\nA Royal Canadian Mounted Police honour guard raised the Greek national flag while the Greek national anthem was then sung by Greek-Canadian opera singer Ariana Chris.\nOlympic Hymn.\nCanadian operatic tenor Ben Heppner, born in British Columbia who performed the national anthem at the 2006 closing ceremony in Torino, then sang the Olympic Hymn, mixing English and French, while the RCMP honour guards lowered the Olympic flag. This flag was raised again in London on July 27, 2012 during the opening ceremonies of the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nHandover of the Olympic flag.\nThe Olympic flag was handed off by Gregor Robertson, the mayor of Vancouver, to Jacques Rogge, the President of the IOC. It was then handed off to the mayor of Sochi, Anatoly Pakhomov, whose city was set to host the 2014 Winter Olympics. The flag arrived in Sochi at the end of March and was raised at that city's municipal building until the 2014 games. During that time, the orchestra played an excerpt from the Olympic Fanfare and Theme by John Williams The flag of Russia was then raised and the Russian national anthem was sung by the , conducted by .\nGreetings from Sochi.\nA demonstration was then staged by the Russians to showcase the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The segment featured Russian supermodel Natalia Vodianova in a video. Maria Guleghina performed while riding on a special troika containing white neon horses, the principal dancers of the Kirov, Bolshoi and Mariinsky ballets, 2006 Olympic champions Tatiana Navka and Roman Kostomarov ice dancing by the Black Sea, giant zorbs rolling around the stage, the appearance of figure skaters Evgeni Plushenko and Irina Rodnina with ice hockey players Alexander Ovechkin and Vladislav Tretiak (four years later, Rodnina and Tretiak would to light the cauldron in Sochi), and as happened 34 years before a live orchestra performance playing in Red Square while being conducted, via satellite, by Valery Gergiev who was inside the BC Place.\nGames declared closed.\nThe games were formally closed by International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge calling them \"excellent and very friendly\" in his tradition of assigning each games their own identity in closing comments. Rogge also addressed the tragic loss of Georgian luger Nodar Kumaritashvili, who died in an accident at the Whistler Sliding Centre on February 12, 2010 in his comments, stating his condolences for the country of Georgia, and that his memory \"will always be with us.\" John Furlong, chair of VANOC, also spoke.\nNeil Young sang \"Long May You Run\" while the Olympic flame was extinguished in both the indoor and outdoor cauldrons. After both flames were extinguished, all four legs of the indoor cauldron descended to the ground.\nCultural section.\nWilliam Shatner, Michael J. Fox and Catherine O'Hara came onto the stadium floor and delivered comedic monologues playing on stereotypes of Canadians. O'Hara's section involved the tendency of Canadians to be overly polite and apologetic. Shatner's section involved beer. Fox's section involved urban areas and terrain.\nThe theme of satirizing Canadian clichés continued with Michael Bublé dressed as a Mountie performing \"The Maple Leaf Forever\" first straight, followed by four scantily clad singer/dancers dressed as Mounties stripping his Mountie uniform to reveal a tuxedo leading to a whimsical Vegas-style arrangement of the song as a procession of giant Mounties, dancing Mounties, hockey players, giant table hockey players wearing gold medals (as Canada won both the men's and women's tournaments), complete with a child dressed as a puck for said game, followed by voyageurs and lumberjacks in dancing canoes, bare-midriff dancing and ceiling hung maple leaves, and last but not least, several giant inflatable beavers and flying moose. \"The Maple Leaf Forever\" was sung using a modern version rather than its traditional lyrics and was arranged in a medley with other pieces. \"Hockey Night in Canada\"'s former, but still iconic, signature tune, \"The Hockey Theme\", was played during the giant-sized hockey match. The entrance of the voyageurs was accompanied by the traditional French-Canadian song \"Envoyons d'l'avant nos gens\" performed by La Bottine Souriante, while the cultural section ended with Bublé singing the last line of \"O Canada\". Audience members were provided with and encouraged to wear headgear fashioned into moose antlers.\nNotable attendees.\nAside from celebrities participating in the ceremony, mayors Robertson and Pakhomov, and members of the International Olympic Committee, the following notable people were in attendance:\nThe Canadian TV network CTV claimed that traditionally a senior government representative of the country hosting the next Winter Olympics is also present during the Closing Ceremony, but neither Russian President Dmitry Medvedev nor Prime Minister Vladimir Putin attended. CTV speculated that this was due to domestic discontent over their nation's performance in Vancouver. In comparison, Canada's Governor General Michaëlle Jean had attended the Torino Olympics closing ceremony.\nTelevision broadcast.\nIn Australia coverage was carried on the Nine Network and Foxtel.\nIn Canada, CTV, Omni Television, Rogers Sportsnet, TSN, RDS and V broadcast the ceremony live. However, there were lengthy commercial breaks during the broadcast, one of which excluded the entrance of the Canadian athletes when returning live. Furthermore, the Canadian broadcast also omitted the men's 50 km classical cross-country medal ceremony and the subsequent Norwegian national anthem. The broadcast was the second-most watched event in Canadian television history, with an estimated 24.5 million people watching some part of the ceremonies (of a population of ~ 34 million).\nIn China, CCTV-1 and CCTV-5 broadcast the ceremony.\nIn Brazil, only Sportv broadcast the ceremony live. Rede Record and Record News broadcast the ceremony 90 minutes after its conclusion, in order not to interfere with its prime-time schedule.\nIn Germany, ZDF carried the closing ceremony. Because of the time difference, it was 3:30 clock in the morning.\nIn Hong Kong, Cable TV Hong Kong broadcast the Closing Ceremony.\nIn Mexico, XEIMT-TV Canal 22 broadcast the ceremony live.\nIn Norway, NRK broadcast the ceremony live.\nIn Russia, Russia 1 broadcast the ceremony live.\nIn the UK, the BBC and British Eurosport broadcast the Closing Ceremony.\nIn the United States, NBC broadcast the Closing Ceremony with coverage starting at 7:00 pm EST. NBC abruptly ended Olympic coverage at 10:30 pm EST, to broadcast the debut of \"The Marriage Ref\", and resumed at 11:35 pm EST after late local news. This spawned outbursts from upset viewers, especially on Twitter.\nSoundtrack.\nSounds of Vancouver 2010: Closing Ceremony Commemorative Album (), the soundtrack for the closing ceremony, was released on the iTunes Store on March 1, 2010. It charted at #17 on the Canadian Albums Chart. \"Un peu plus haut, un peu plus loin\", performed by Garou is the only track from the opening ceremony included."

        "title": "1908 New Zealand rugby league season",
        "text": "The 1908 New Zealand rugby league season was the first season that rugby league had been played in New Zealand. Auckland played Wellington in a two match series that was won by Auckland 1-0. Otago and Southland also participated in a two match series which was drawn 1-all. Auckland and Taranaki then drew a two match series.\nThe impetuous for the season was the return of the 1907-1908 New Zealand professional rugby team that had toured Australia and Great Britain. On their return many players wanted to start the game in New Zealand and helped found clubs. During 1908 a New Zealand Māori rugby league team was also touring Australia. The Māori tour included Alex Stanaway, Peter Moko, Glen Pakere, Albert and Ernie Asher, Riki Papakura and Frank Barclay.\nFirst game.\nThe first game of rugby league ever played in New Zealand occurred on 13 June 1908 and was played between members of the 1907-1908 touring party. The game was a memorial game for the deceased Albert Baskerville and was held at Athletic Park in Wellington. New South Wales were originally scheduled to participate but they instead remained in Sydney to play the touring Māori team. Instead the touring party divided themselves into two groups and played each other. 8,000 people attended to see the \"Wright's Blacks\" defeat the \"Turtill's Reds\" 55-20. The match allowed the team to raise £300 for Mrs Baskiville, Albert's mother. It was also the last match of rugby league played at Athletic Park until 1990.\nClub game.\nThe Britannia and Pirates rugby union clubs, from Invercargill, played the first club game of rugby league in New Zealand on 22 July at Domain Ground, Bluff, using rule books bought back to New Zealand by the touring party and sent down to Invercargill. All Black Ned Hughes was the captain of the Britannia club, which also included future New Zealand international Walter Milne. The match was played after both sides had been suspended by the Southland Rugby Union for \"striking\" after they had refused to go back onto the field after halftime due to the blizzard conditions.\nAuckland v Wellington.\nAs the majority of the returned players were from Auckland and Wellington these two regions had an advantage in setting up teams. It is therefore of no surprise that the first provincial games of rugby league were played between Auckland and Wellington.\nGame one.\nThe first game was played at Victoria Park, Auckland on 24 August in front of a crowd of 8,000. Victoria Park was the home of the new Ponsonby United Rugby League Club which had been founded by Bill Tyler and Charles Dunning. Daniel Fraser was the organising secretary and thirteen of the tourists took part in the game including Dick Wynyard, who captained Auckland. Wellington scored four tries to Auckland's two but Auckland won 16-14 due to the goal kicking of Bill Tyler. \nEdward Tyne and Adam Lile both worked for the New Zealand Railways Department and were threatened with losing their jobs if they played in the match. Tyne, who had a family, withdrew while Lile played and was subsequently fired.\nGame two.\nA return match was played at Petone Recreation Ground, Petone on 12 September and was drawn 13-all in front of 4,000 spectators. The Wellington side were bolstered by All Golds Hercules Wright, Tom Cross and Edward Tyne who had missed the first match. Future internationals Bert King and Henry Knight also made their debuts for Wellington in this match. Auckland had lost Bill Wynyard but gained Albert Asher and Frank Barclay.\nOtago v Southland.\nAfter the first club game in the South Island the Northern Union Amateur Rugby League (Otago Centre) was formed. The organisation then arranged a home and away series between Otago and Southland. All members of the two teams were given life bans by the New Zealand Rugby Union.\nGame one.\nThe first game was played at Caledonian Ground in Dunedin on 3 October and used goalposts which were rented from the Otago Rugby Union. The Southland side included Ned Hughes, George Burgess and Don Hamilton, all former All Blacks. Otago won the match 11-8.\nThe Otago side was made up of fullback D Bannantyne, three-quarters J Harrhy, WR Kirk and G Ogg, five-eighths EO Nees and P Walker, halfback J Coulter, and forwards J Bryant, E Manley (captain), T Mockford, W Harridge, J Campbell and Larkins.\nGame two.\nA return match was played at Queens Park, Invercargill on 7 October. Southland was able to win the match 30-14 and draw the series.\nTaranaki v Auckland.\nMeanwhile, Adam Lile had been organising the game in Taranaki and a Taranaki team took on Auckland in a two match series with Lile acting as Taranaki's player-coach.\nGame one.\nThe first game was held in New Plymouth five days after the second Auckland v Wellington match. On the 17 September Aucklanmd lost to Taranaki 5-3 at Western Park in front of a crowd of 600. Auckland included Alf Chorley, who had previously played for Halifax and Swinton, and Thomas Houghton. Taranaki included Arthur Hardgrave, Ernie Buckland and Gordon Hooker.\nGame two.\nAuckland however won the second game 21-18. This match was held in Auckland.\nPonsonby.\nThe Ponsonby United Rugby League Club was formed in August 1908 by a group that included Billy Tyler and Charlie Dunning. Ponsonby played a series of matches against loosely organised teams during 1908."

        "text": "At the 2001 East Asian Games, the athletics events were held in Osaka, Japan from 23 to 26 May 2001. A total of 45 events were contested, of which 23 by male and 22 by female athletes. All events were held at the Nagai Stadium, with the exception of the racewalking and half marathon events. A team of Australian athletes took part in the competition but they were excluded from the medal tally. This was the last time that Kazakhstan competed in the competition.\nIn the third edition of the multi-sport event, 20 Games records were improved over the four-day athletics competition. China had the greatest gold medal haul with 27, largely due to the success of their women athletes, who won all but three of the women's events. The hosts, Japan, won the most medals overall, winning 11 golds, 22 silvers and 51 medals in total. The women's events over 400 metres brought a number of Japanese records: Kazue Kakinuma broke the 400 m sprint record, Makiko Yoshida set a new record in the 400 metres hurdles, and the 4×400 metres relay team made a new national best of 3:33.06. Seventeen-year-old Liu Xiang set a new 110 metres hurdles record of 13.42 for the first gold medal of his career.\nAll the Games records in the relay races were broken, meaning that both Shingo Suetsugu (who broke the 200 metres record) and Bu Fanfang (who broke the 400 m record) made new Games records in multiple events. Some athletes took on two individual events in the competition schedule and doubled their medal hauls: Gennadiy Chernovol took 100 m gold and 200 m silver while his Kazakh compatriot Mihail Kolganov won gold in the 800 and 1500 m. Wu Wen-Chien did a bronze double in the 5000 m and steeplechase for Chinese Taipei, and Dong Yanmei won two golds in the 5000 and 10,000 m events. Kumiko Ikeda of Japan set personal bests in the long jump and 100 metres hurdles for a silver and bronze medal, respectively."

He was the general manager for the Memphis Express of the Alliance of American Football (AAF).

The list only includes players who have played in a match recognized by USA Rugby as a test match, whether it was played before or after the governing body was founded in 1975. (In rugby union, any match of a nation's senior side recognized as a Test by its national governing body is included in test statistics for that nation.) Players that were first capped during the same match are listed in order of those that began in the starting line up before replacements and then in alphabetical order by surname. Note that the \"position\" column lists the position at which the player made his Test debut, not necessarily the position for which he is best known. (For example, Mike Te'o made his debut for the Eagles at scrum-half, but has made the majority of his appearances representing the United States at either fullback or wing.) A position in parentheses indicates that the player debuted as a substitute.\nMembers of the national rugby union team who have been inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame include the players from the Gold medal-winning teams from the (inducted in 2012) and Dan Carroll, player-coach of the 1920 Olympic team (inducted in his own right in 2016).\nEarly years.\nAlthough the United States of America Rugby Football Union (now known as USA Rugby) was not formally established until 1975, USA Rugby has recognized six matches played before that time as international matches with caps awarded. Then referred to as \"All America\", a team composed of California collegiate rugby players first toured Australia in 1910, competing in twenty matches against multiple state-representative sides and the then recently-formed New Zealand Māori. This team played respectably, and although they lost the majority of their matches, they secured a draw against the Ranfurly Shield-holding Auckland rugby union team. The California Rugby Union organizers of the tour invited a joint Australasian team to come to California for a tour, but separate tours from the Australian and New Zealand teams were arranged instead. These tours, in 1912 and 1913 respectively, resulted in the first matches recognized as international tests. Each match resulted in a defeat for the Americans. Laird \"Monte\" Morris served as captain for the match in 1912. Deke Gard, veteran of the 1912 team, captained the team in 1913.\nAfter the All Blacks tour, amid a time where prominent California colleges and universities were transitioning back to playing American football from rugby union, no further matches were held. However, after organizing a team for a successful tour of British Columbia in early 1920, the California Rugby Union successfully petitioned the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) to enter a team at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium. The USOC declined to provide any funding for this team; in June 1920, the Amateur Athletic Union agreed to pay for the team's expenses. After each of the home nations declined to send a team to the Games on account of scheduling conflicts with their domestic competitions, and the teams from Romania and Czechoslovakia withdrew from the Games on short notice, the Olympic rugby union competition was reduced to a single match between the United States and France. After a scoreless first half, the United States won this match by a score of 8–0. Following the Olympics, the French Rugby Union invited the American team to tour France. Sixteen members of the team that competed in the Olympics traveled to France and played three uncapped matches against regional opposition from the southeast, south, and southwest of France; each resulted in a victory for the Americans. A final match against the France national team was held on October 10, 1920 in Paris, resulting in a 14–5 defeat for the Americans. Upon returning to the United States, the team was disbanded. Charles Tilden served as team captain during the 1920 Olympics and the tour of France that followed. Daniel Carroll, veteran of the 1913 team, served as player-coach in 1920; he was inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2016.\nIn September 1923, the Americans received an invitation from the French Olympic Committee to defend their Olympic title at the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris. As in 1920, the newly re-formed team was required to provide for its own funding, as the USOC declined to provide any. This time, however, the Olympic competition expanded to a three-team round-robin tournament with the United States, France, and Romania competing. Both the United States and France defeated Romania by wide margins in the first two matches of the tournament, leaving the two teams to contest for the gold medal in the final match. On May 18, 1924, before a hostile crowd of approximately 35,000 people, the Americans defeated France by a 17–3 score. Following the Games, rugby was subsequently removed from the Olympic program, and the two-time Olympic champions returned home to little fanfare. Colby \"Babe\" Slater was the team captain during the 1924 Olympics. Charles Doe, who acted as captain in Slater's absence in the Olympic match against Romania, was the team's vice-captain. Charles Austin, himself a veteran of team in 1912 and 1913, coached the team in 1924. All of the players from the Gold medal-winning teams in 1920 and 1924 were inducted into the World Rugby Hall of Fame in 2012.\n1970s–present.\nUSA Rugby was formally organized in June 1975 and fielded its first men's national team on January 31, 1976 in a test match against Australia—a 24–12 defeat. Robbie Bordley served as team captain in this first match, and in the team's first modern-era test match against France on June 12, 1976."

Miller also refereed Canadian university hockey from 1982 to 1985. In 1985, she was a member of the Canadian Hockey Feminine Council and was president of the Southern Alberta Women’s Hockey League. She helped to form the first ever girls minor hockey association in Calgary in 1989.\nCoaching career.\nHockey Canada.\nShe was an assistant coach for Team Alberta at the 1991 Canada Winter Games.

She is the most successful NCAA women's hockey coach in Frozen Four tournament wins (11) and NCAA Division I national championships (five). She reached her 250th and 300th career wins faster than any other head coach in NCAA Division I history. She is the third best Division I coach in wins and just one of two Division I coaches to reach the 200-win mark in eight seasons.\nIn June 2011, Miller was named the coaching mentor for the Russian senior national team in preparation for the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.\nHeading into the 2011–12 Minnesota–Duluth Bulldogs women's ice hockey season, Miller was chair of the Ethics Committee for US women's college hockey.

On March 15, the jury found the university guilty of sex discrimination and retaliation and awarded Miller $3.74 million ($744,832 in past lost wages and $3 million in past emotional distress.) No award was made for future emotional distress and the judge was to determine any award for future lost wages.\nIn December 2019 University of Minnesota-Duluth officials finalized a settlement with Miller totalling $4,530,157, with a payment of $2,102,939 to Miller, and $2,427,218 to her attorneys.\nCWHL.\nOn June 23, 2018, Miller signed a contract to become the head coach for the Calgary Inferno of the CWHL.

        "text": "The Brown Bears women’s ice hockey program is an NCAA Division I ice hockey team that represents Brown University. The Bears play at the Meehan Auditorium in Providence, Rhode Island. Brown women's hockey is the oldest women's hockey program in the United States. It was the first collegiate women's ice hockey program in the United States, started in 1964. The team was led from 1989 to 2011 by Head Coach Digit Murphy, who became the winningest coach in Division I women's ice hockey history during her 18th season at Brown (2006–2007).\nHistory.\nBrown University Women's Ice Hockey is widely regarded as being one of the premier collegiate programs globally. Several former players are Olympic medal winners.\nIn 1964, the Brown Bears men's coach Jim Fullerton arranged for Nancy Schieffelin to attend a team practice. She was an experienced player and came to the practice disguised in full uniform. A year later, Brown University would have the first women’s ice hockey program. The team was known as the Pembroke Pandas. The Pandas would have to borrow equipment, and sell hockey rule sheets at the Bears men's games to raise money for equipment. In February 1966, the Pandas (Brown Bears) women’s ice hockey team played their first game. Against the Walpole Brooms, the club lost by a 4–1 score.\nIn 1976, Brown would host the first ever Ivy League women's ice hockey tournament. The other competing schools were Cornell, Princeton and Yale. The Big Red would win the tournament.\nBetween 1994 and 1997, the Bears won three consecutive ECAC regular season championships. During that time span, the Bears were undefeated in the league during the 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons. The undefeated streak spanned 49 ECAC games. The Bears competed in the first AWCHA Division I National Ice Hockey Championship. Contested in March 1998, the Bears were defeated by the New Hampshire Wildcats by a 4–1 score.\nIn 1999–2000, Brown reach its second national championship final in three years. Coach Digit Murphy, who has been building the program since 1988, used virtually every player on her bench and eventually wore out opponents. She even went so far as to take the advice of a volunteer assistant coach by allowing her centers to take turns choosing the wings on their lines. Jill Graat was named captain of the team. The team withstood a season-ending ACL injury to its best player, U.S. Olympic defenseman Tara Mounsey, and went on to win nineteen straight games entering the 2000 national championship game.\nAli Brewer holds every Brown goaltending record for a season or a career. In her four seasons with the Bears, she posted a 1.37 goals-against average and a .943 save percentage. In addition, she had 2,490 saves and posting 39 shutouts. Numerous records were set by Brewer including, a 0.94 GAA and .957 save percentage in her freshman season, 13 shutouts in her junior season, and 25 wins in her senior campaign. Another record that she holds is five consecutive shutouts, set her junior season, in which she blanked Cornell (3–0), St. Lawrence (5–0), Niagara twice (6–0 both games), and Colby (9–0).\nDuring Brewer’s four seasons, the Bears never won fewer than 20 games in a season. The Bears won ECAC Championships in 1998 and 2000, with Brewer earning MVP honors during the 2000 Championship. The Bears also played in the AWCHA Tournament three times from 1998–2000, finishing as the National Runner-Up twice.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nAwards and honors.\nKate Silver '86 Award.\nIn recognition of an outstanding first year female varsity athlete at Brown University\nSakuma Award.\nThe Sakuma Award is a team award given for perfect attendance at practices and games."

        "title": "Skateboarding in China",
        "text": "Skateboarding arrived in China in April 1986 when an American skateboarder arrived in China to study Chinese at the Beijing Language Institute. He says, \"When I arrived in China, there wasn't even a word in Chinese for skateboard. People were really interested in learning to ride, and in a few years Chinese skaters started appearing in almost every city I travelled to\". Domestic skate companies and retailers began to appear at around the turn of the century, bringing the average price for a skateboard of ordinary quality down from an expensive 1000 yuan to around 280 yuan as of 2009. Skateboarding has been slow to develop in China because of the lack of a strong preexisting street culture and of skating infrastructure; nevertheless, it's estimated that as of 2009 there are 40,000 to 50,000 skateboarders in China.\nThe first major skateboard brand to enter China was Powell Peralta, who in the early 1990s gave Chinese skaters a taste of the skateboarding by organizing a skateboard club, sponsoring contests and bringing over famous professional skateboarders. Many participants in the Powell events are still involved in the industry today, including Yuan Fei, who runs a skateshop in Qingdao and has the well-received skateboard brand, Lady, Wang Lei, the recipient of Powell's first board in China, who at 40 is still skating hard, and Xia Yu, who is now a well-known movie star and avid skateboard and snowboarder.\nAnother significant figure in the development of skateboarding in China has been Jeff Han (Han Minjie). After a decade-long career with a milk company, in 1999 Han quit and co-founded Fly Streetwear with Danny Yuan Yuan Zhang, the first skateshop in Shanghai. He and Danny Yuan Yuan Zhang also founded Gift Skateboards together, a manufacturer that initially produced only boards for foreign brands but has now become the leading domestic skateboard brand; Cart Wheels, another skateboard brand; and Skatehere.com, the most popular Chinese-language skateboarding website. In addition to his companies, he runs a professional skateboarding team. In 2007, Nike Skateboarding created the Fly Milk Blazer Premium sneaker in tribute to Han.\nBusiness.\nAlong with Jeff Han's companies, one of the oldest and most important Chinese skateboard companies is Shehui (; English: \"Society\") Skateboards. Headquartered in Beijing, it was founded by Raph Cooper, a USC alum who had studied abroad at Peking University in 2000.\nA number of Western skate shoe brands have presences in China. These brands include Vans, DC Shoes Nike SB, Circa, Converse and Adidas. In the domain of skateboarding apparel, Jeff Han reports that\nVans is the No.1. Adidas is the new comer in China. I still remember that on the first opening day of Vans at Fly, we sold RMB 50,000 of Vans. As a matter of fact, before Vans’ official launch in China, it was already superbly popular in Beijing. Converse was replaced by Vans as the symbol of cool. Nike successfully launched some limited editions that are more expensive…\nHan regards Nike Skateboarding's history in China as a major success story. Though not respected as a skate brand at the time they launched in the Chinese market in 2004, through sponsorships of successful Chinese skateboarders such as Che Lin and Zeng Guanhao as well as intense local marketing efforts, they won broad recognition in China. ʻAukai is well known too.\nThe Biggest Skateboards Company is \"Challenge Skateboards.\" and now they start their new company \"FDskateboarding\" (沸点滑板有限公司) to promote their domestic business. They have 11 skateboard (and skateboard related) brands: Symbolic Skateboards, Boiling Skateboards, Justice Skateboards, Black Knight Skateboards, Psychos Skateboards, Peer Trucks, Donuts Wheels, a Chinese skateboarding portals website:Chinaskateboards.cn &amp; a printed magazine \"Whatsup\" skateboard magazine (Chinese).\nSkateparks and other skating locations.\nChinese skateboarding champion Che Lin estimated in 2009 that there were fewer than ten skateparks in China.\nNingbo.\nSkateboard Supercross Ningbo skatepark (SBSX Ningbo).\nOne of the largest skatepark in the China with 42,000sqf. SBSX Ningbo is a game changing skatepark and pumptrack aka super track. It was built inside of Georgia School Ningbo where 2000 studentstake skateboarding as PE Class daily. ⁣\nThe park features ⁣an Intermediate level street course, a semi enclosed bowl, ⁣rails and the world’s first concrete pumptrack designed for multiperson races.\nThe park is lit, allowing night sessions.\nShanghai.\nSMP Skatepark (Shanghai Multimedia Park).\nFormerly the largest skatepark in the world. SMP is located on the outskirts of Shanghai in New Jiangwan City. It was completed in 2005 and is more than 12,000 square meters in size, containing the world's longest vert ramp, the world's largest concrete skate bowl, a huge downhill 3/4 to full pipe, several smaller bowls, a street section, and a 5,000-seat stadium. Despite the publicity of the high-profile events that have taken place there, it has attracted sparse crowds.\nYuanShen Skatepark (Top Toys).\nThis park was created when the red metal ramps from the SMP skatepark were transferred to the YuanShen Stadium in 2008. These metal ramps were originally used as a competition course in the stadium portion of the SMP skatepark. The skatepark is often referred to as the Red SMP skatepark. Top Toys took over management of YuanShen skatepark located on Line 6 in June 2010 when they opened a skateshop on location.\nBin Jiang Skatepark.\nThis is a sunken plaza/street style course with stairs, ledges, banks, kickers, hubbas, etc. There are no transitions.

It was known as Woodward Beijing from its opening in 2010 until March 2014. It is located in the rural southern 6th ring road. It is one of the largest indoor skate parks in the world, and it previously hosted the notorious Vans Night. There are also several skateparks. Ezone Sk8 Park in Fangzhuang hosts Andrew Guan's (Guan Mu's) Kicker Club, a nationwide skateboarding club with approximately 200 members in Beijing. (Guan runs a blog named after his club.) Sk8 Warehouse, founded in 2009, is an indoor park in an industrial complex just north of Shuangjing Bridge. Honglingjin Park, in Chaoyang District, also contains a skatepark. In May 2010, Woodward Youth Action Sports Camp opened in Daxing District; it contains facilities for skateboarding, BMX, and motocross and represents a government investment of $21.96 million. There are also plenty of small skateparks in the Shunyi area inside the villas such as Yosemite and Dragon Bay villa.\nShenzhen.\nShenzhen is the most popular destination for visiting pros. Spots in Shenzhen have been featured in videos by Nike Skateboarding, Zero Skateboards, and Transworld Skateboarding. Shenzhen is known for its smooth black marble ledges and police officer and security guards who are largely indifferent to skateboarding. In 2009, Shenzhen Museum became the first area in Shenzhen where skateboarding was prevented when authorities placed flower pots around the central ledge.\nIn 2011, \"Transworld Skateboarding\" listed Shenzhen as one of the best 10 cities to skate in the world. Every winter skateboarders from all over the world come to skate and spend their winter in Shenzhen."

Exhausted, he suddenly notices an exercise advertisement in his newspaper. He orders gymnastics equipment and with the aid of an instruction record he tries out using the barbells, the chin-up bars and cable expanders, all of which meet with disastrous results. Goofy destroys the floors of his apartment in the process and flies out of the window before he is swung back against the muscular chart of his equipment.

        "text": "Sir Eric Young (6 February 1891 – 12 March 1973) was a Scotland international rugby union player. He played as a Centre. He was later knighted for his mining career.\nRugby union career.\nAmateur career.\nHe went to Loretto School, and then went to Durham University. He played rugby for Durham University and Hartlepool Rovers.\nProvincial career.\nUntil his selection for Scotland, Young turned out for Durham County.\nHe played for Whites Trial side on 6 January 1912.\nInternational career.\nThe Edinburgh Evening News of 30 December 1910 noted that Young was 'big, strong and tremendously fast' and stated: 'Though associated as a senior with Durham County, Young is of Scottish parentage – and he was in the Loretto team which won the schools championship the other year.'\nHe was capped once for Scotland in 1911.\nMilitary career.\nIn the First World War, he served with the 3rd Yorkshire Regiment as a Lieutenant and saw action in France.\nMining career.\nHe went into the mining industry, first as a mining engineer, at various sites around England, and then became Managing Director of Bolsover Colliery. He was one of the two original production members of the National Coal Board.\nHe was awarded a knighthood in the 1949 New Year Honours.\nHe was to quit the National Coal Board in 1950 after a spat with Philip Noel-Baker, the Minister of Fuel and Power. The \"Bradford Observer\" of 5 December 1950 noted:\nI understand that the main difference of opinion of Sir Eric Young, the [National Coal] Board, and the Minister is over the question of centralisation. Sir Eric has been an exponent of more de-centralisation for the coal industry and has continually pressed his views on the matter.\nThe \"Surrey Mirror\" of 8 December 1950 noted:\nRegarded as the country’s leading expert on coal production, he has been consistent in his expressed view that one of the solutions to the industry’s problems is harder work by the miners – a view that has not altogether endeared him to the miners and their trade union leaders.\nThe \"Northampton Chronicle and Echo\" of Tuesday 12 December 1950 headlines 'Intemperate language by Sir Eric Young' and notes that Philip Noel-Baker had decided to sack Young on 23 November and informed him then that he would not be re-appointed to the National Coal Board. On asking Sir Young for a statement, he said: 'There seems to be a conflict of opinion on what was said and done. The public may form their own judgement.'\nFamily.\nHe was the second son of Dr. Moffat Young (1866–1918) of West Hartlepool, originally of Derry; and Dorothea Dunn Morison (1856–1944) of Durham. \nHis grandmother Dorothy Rutherford (1824–1894) was from Midlothian.\nHe married Margaret Mary Hayward in 1928, a daughter of Rev. A. E. Hayward."

        "text": "The 2006 IIHF World Championship rosters consisted of 370 players on 16 national ice hockey teams. Run by the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF), the Ice Hockey World Championships is the sport's highest-profile annual international tournament. The 2006 IIHF World Championship was the 70th edition of the tournament and was held in Riga, Latvia. Sweden won the Championship, the eighth time they had done so.\nBefore the start of the World Championship, each participating nation had to submit a list of players for its roster. A minimum of fifteen skaters and two goaltenders, and a maximum of twenty skaters and three goaltenders had to be selected. If a country selects fewer than the maximum allowed, they must choose the remaining players prior to the start of the tournament. After the start of the tournament, each team was allowed to select an additional two players, either skaters or goaltenders, to their roster, for a maximum roster of 25 players. Once players were registered to the team, they could not be removed from the roster.\nTo qualify for a national team under IIHF rules, a player must follow several criteria. He must be a citizen of the nation, and be under the jurisdiction of that national association. Players are allowed to switch which national team they play for, providing they fulfill the IIHF criteria. If participating for the first time in an IIHF event, the player would have had to play two consecutive years in the national competition of the new country without playing in another country. If the player has already played for a national team before, he may switch countries if he is a citizen of the new country, and has played for four consecutive years in the national competition of the new country. This switch may only happen once in the player's life.\nNiklas Kronwall of Sweden was named the tournament's most valuable player and best defenceman by the IIHF directorate. Sidney Crosby of Canada led the tournament in goals and total point scoring, and was named the top forward. Swede Johan Holmqvist was selected as top goaltender. Finland's Fredrik Norrena led goaltenders in save percentage, with 0.951."

This causes NHL player selections to be limited to those whose seasons has ended. The 2005 Tournament had rosters made up of more top end talent, as players were available due to the NHL Lockout in 2005, which saw the season cancelled and the Stanley Cup vacated. "

The final cut was selected from a group of 38 referees revealed in October 2008, themselves whittled down from an initial group of 54 selected for the Refereeing Assistance Programme in 2007. From the quarter-finals onwards, the pool of referees was reduced to 19.\nSelection process.\nIn 2007, the FIFA Executive Committee set up the Refereeing Assistance Programme (RAP) to help prepare the referees in contention to officiate at the 2010 World Cup; 54 were selected to make up the initial group. Over the following months, they were assessed based on their performances at FIFA tournaments, RAP seminars and in their domestic leagues. In September 2008, 53 of the original 54 referees attended an \"Elite Referee\" seminar in Zürich, Switzerland, where their technical, physical and mental abilities were analysed. The results were presented to the FIFA Referees' Committee, who preselected 38 trios of referees and their assistants on 22 October.\nFrom this group of 38, ten trios – representing all six confederations – were selected to referee at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup, hosted by South Africa as preparation for the World Cup 12 months later. This assignment was viewed by FIFA as part of the referees' assessment, to ensure that they are prepared for the technical and physical demands of the World Cup in South Africa.\nThe final 30 trios of officials were announced at a meeting of the FIFA Referees Committee in Zürich on 5 February 2010. The trios were assessed using the same criteria as for the original cut. Following their selection, each official underwent FIFA's pre-competition medical assessment (PCMA) at the Schulthess Clinic in Zürich between 25 February and 6 March.\nHowever, on 27 May 2010, two referees – Carlos Amarilla and Mohamed Benouza – and their assistants were removed from the final list, following the assistant referees' failure in the standard fitness tests, the same tests as those held in Zurich. Uruguayan referee Martín Vázquez and his assistant referees were called up as a replacement trio.\nFor the quarter-finals onwards, FIFA trimmed their list of match officials, allowing 10 teams of referees to return home. The teams sent home were those of Roberto Rosetti (Italy), Jorge Larrionda (Uruguay), Stéphane Lannoy (France), Massimo Busacca (Switzerland), Martin Hansson (Sweden), Koman Coulibaly (Mali), Subkhiddin Mohd Salleh (Malaysia), Peter O'Leary (New Zealand), Martín Vázquez (Uruguay) and Joel Aguilar (El Salvador)."

This victory set up a Triple Crown decider with at Twickenham. On 19 March 1938 Scotland beat England 21–16, scoring a record five tries to one, to achieve their eighth Triple Crown. The match was the first rugby international broadcast live on television. Due to injury and the outbreak of World War II, Forrest never played for Scotland again.\nMilitary career.\nJohn Forrest was serving as a lieutenant in the Air Branch of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve based at HMS Blackcap when he lost his life in 1942. On 28 August 1942, 880 Naval Air Squadron disembarked from HMS Indomitable (92) to dispose of their Sea Hurricanes and refit with the Supermarine Seafire at HMS Blackcap in Cheshire. During formation practice on 14 September 1942, a Spitfire VB (AB873) based at HMS Blackcap collided with another Spitfire (BL487) at a height of around 7,000 feet. AB 873 crashed at Pownall Green Farm, Tabley, near Northwich and Lt JGS Forrest was killed. On 21 September 880 Squadron moved to RNAS Machrihanish near Campbeltown in Scotland.\nDeath.\nThe following obituaries were published shortly after his death:-\nThe Scotsman newspaper on Tuesday 29 September 1942:\nRugby men everywhere will have read with deep regret of the death in action of that grand Scots international three-quarter J.G.S. Forrest, R.N. Air Arm. No matter whether he was in the centre or on the wing, every time he pulled more than his weight. I saw his Freshman’s match at Cambridge. He was not in either team as they lined out but, upon a centre having to go off crocked, Forrest came on to take his place. It was seen in the twinkling of an eye that Cambridge had here a \"find\". He never looked back, got his Blue as a Fresher, and from that, my first view of him to my last when I saw him get a try \"in a hundred\" last year at Taunton he never gave a bad or a poor game in my seeing. He and H. D. Freakes, the two mighty opposites in a well-remembered tackle in a Varsity match, when both were in the centre, have now made the great sacrifice, lamented by all who ever knew them or only saw them play.\nD.R. Gent, writing in \"The Sunday Times\" in 1942:\nForrest was a magnificent player, whether on the wing or in the centre. I preferred him in the centre, where his running and serving and side-stepping and kicking and passing gave me no end of pleasure; and I am sure that in this modest and charming young Scotsman we have lost a great rugby footballer in the making."

        "title": "List of Major League Baseball annual runs batted in leaders",
        "text": "In baseball, a run batted in (RBI) is awarded to a batter for each runner who scores as a result of the batter's action, including a hit, fielder's choice, sacrifice fly, bases loaded walk, or hit by pitch. A batter is also awarded an RBI for scoring himself upon hitting a home run.\nIn Major League Baseball (MLB), a player in each league wins the \"RBI crown\" or \"RBI title\" each season by hitting the most runs batted in that year. The first RBI champion in the National League (NL) was Deacon White; in the league's inaugural 1876 season, White hit 60 RBIs for the Chicago White Stockings. The American League (AL) was established in 1901, and Hall of Fame second baseman Nap Lajoie led that league with 125 RBIs for the Philadelphia Athletics. Over the course of his 27-season career, Cap Anson led the NL in RBI eight times. Babe Ruth and Honus Wagner have the second- and third-most RBI titles, respectively: Ruth with six, and Wagner with five. Several players are tied for the most consecutive seasons led with three: Anson (twice), Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Ruth, Joe Medwick, George Foster, and Cecil Fielder. Notably, Matt Holliday won the NL title in 2007 by one RBI over Ryan Howard, only overtaking Howard due to his performance in the 2007 National League Wild Card tie-breaker game. Had Howard won the 2007 title, he would have led the NL in a record four consecutive seasons from 2006 to 2009. The most recent champions are Kyle Tucker in the American League, and Matt Olson in the National League.\nSam Thompson was the first to set a single-season RBI record that stood for more than three seasons, hitting 166 in 1887. Thompson's title that season also represented the widest margin of victory for an RBI champion as he topped the next highest total by 62 RBIs. The single-season mark of 166 stood for over thirty years until Babe Ruth hit 171 in 1921. Ruth's mark was then broken by teammate Lou Gehrig six seasons later in 1927 when Gehrig hit 175 RBI. Finally, Hack Wilson set the current record mark of 191 RBI in 1930 with the Chicago Cubs. The all-time career RBI record holder is Hank Aaron with 2,297, 84 more than Ruth in second place. Aaron led the National League in RBI four times, never consecutively. The 1930 season when Wilson set the record saw four players hit more than 160 RBI: Wilson, Gehrig, Chuck Klein, and Al Simmons. A player has batted in 160 or more runs 21 times, with 14 of these seasons occurring during the 1930s and only twice since 1940. The lowest RBI total to ever lead a major league was 49, by Deacon White in the National League's second season."

The 1998 competition was the seventh World Aquatics Championships. However, synchronised swimming is unique at the championships, in that only women compete in the discipline. For the 1998 edition, three events were contested; solo, duet, and team routines. \nThe Russian team was dominant, winning the gold medal in all three events contested. Olga Sedakova became only the fourth woman to win a gold medal in every discipline at the same championships, following Teresa Andersen in the first World Aquatics Championships in 1973, Carolyn Waldo in 1986, and Becky Dyroen-Lancer at the previous competition in 1994. North America had their worst showing ever at the World Aquatics Championships, Canada did not win any medals in synchronised swimming for the first time ever. The United States missed the podium in the solo and duet competitions, after winning at least one medal in those disciplines at every previous competition.\nMultiple Medal Winners.\nOther than Sedakova, several other competitors won multiple medals. For Russia, Olga Brusnikina, won gold in the duet and team routines. Japan had two multiple winners; Miya Tachibana won bronze in the solo, and silver with partner Miho Takeda in both the duet and team competitions. For France Virginie Dedieu won a silver in the solo competition, and a bronze in the duet."

        "text": "The Milwaukee Panthers men's basketball team is an NCAA Division I college basketball team competing in the Horizon League for the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. They play their home games at UW–Milwaukee Panther Arena in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and are currently coached by Bart Lundy. The Panthers have made four NCAA Tournament tournament appearances, most recently in 2014.\nHistory.\nUWM's predecessor institutions (Milwaukee Normal School, Milwaukee State Teachers College and Milwaukee State College) have competed in basketball since the 19th century as the Milwaukee Normals (1896–1927) and Milwaukee State Green Gulls (1927–1956).\nMilwaukee State's only undefeated season came in 1940 under head coach Guy Penwell as the Green Gulls finished the year 16–0 enroute to their third Wisconsin State Conference championship.\nThe team competed under the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee name for the first time for the 1956–57 season. In honor of joining the University of Wisconsin System, they sported the cardinal red and white colors and adopted \"Cardinals\" as their nickname. Three years later, the Cardinals made their first post-season appearance in the 1960 NCAA Men's Division II Basketball Tournament.\n1965–1998: Becoming the Panthers; up to Division I.\nSeeking to establish their own identity, Milwaukee adopted the colors of black and gold on September 1, 1965 and became known as the Panthers. They also left the Wisconsin State College Conference (now the Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference), of which they had been members since 1913, to form a conference with other urban public universities in the Great Lakes region such as Illinois-Chicago and Cleveland State. Such plans for a new conference never materialized, and the Panthers remained independent even as they moved from the NCAA College Division (now NCAA Division II) to the University Division (now NCAA Division I) in 1973.\nThe team moved again to NCAA Division III in 1980. Between 1985 and 1987, Milwaukee competed in the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. In 1987, the program moved to NCAA Division II where it won its regional in the 1989 NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament, advancing to the contest's Elite Eight. Since 1990, Milwaukee Men's Basketball has competed in NCAA Division I. They played in the Mid-Continent Conference for one year in 1993–94 before joining the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, which became the Horizon League in 1999 and has been the Panthers' home ever since.\n1999–2001: Bo Ryan era.\nIn 1999, the Panthers hired Bo Ryan, a highly successful Division III coach at UW–Plattville, as the team's new head coach. Under Ryan, the Panthers had their first consecutive winning seasons since 1993, and Ryan was also instrumental in bringing wider attention and fan enthusiasm to the program. After just two seasons, Ryan left to become the head coach of the Wisconsin Badgers.\n2002–2005: Bruce Pearl era.\nAfter Bo Ryan's departure, Milwaukee would hire Bruce Pearl, a successful Division II coach at Southern Indiana, as head coach. Milwaukee reached new heights of success during the mid-2000s, making its first NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship appearance in 2003 under Pearl, followed by a Sweet Sixteen appearance in 2005 and a second-round appearance in 2006. Pearl left to become the head coach at Tennessee after 2005 and the school hired Rob Jeter, a former assistant under Bo Ryan. The Panthers won three straight regular-season Horizon League championships from 2004 to 2006 as well as the Horizon League tournament championship in 2003, 2005, and 2006. \n2006–2015: Rob Jeter era.\nThe Panthers' most recent Horizon League regular season championship came in 2011. In 2014, the Panthers won the Horizon League tournament, making their first NCAA tournament appearance since 2006. Just a few weeks later, UWM was handed a one-year postseason ban due to a low Academic Progress Rate. Under Jeter, while the Panthers were mostly competitive, they were unable to stay consistently on top in the Horizon League standings.\nOn March 17, 2016, Milwaukee fired Rob Jeter after 11 seasons with the Panthers.\n2016–2021: LaVall Jordan and Pat Baldwin eras.\nOn April 7, 2016, Milwaukee announced that Michigan assistant coach LaVall Jordan would be the new head coach.\nLess than one year later, on March 3, 2017, the Panthers made history by being the first No. 10 seed to win a game in the Horizon League Tournament. They went on to place second overall in the tournament, losing to Northern Kentucky in the championship game on March 7. After this one lone season, Jordan accepted the head coaching job at Butler. On June 20, Milwaukee hired Northwestern assistant coach Pat Baldwin as their new head coach.\nIn 2021, the Panthers made national news when they were able to successfully recruit Baldwin's son Patrick Baldwin Jr., who was rated by ESPN as the number four rated recruit in the country, becoming the highest rated player to commit to a Horizon League school. Baldwin Jr. struggled with injury in his freshman season, and the Panthers finished the season 10–22. On March 2, 2022, Pat Baldwin was fired as head coach after five straight losing seasons. Patrick Baldwin Jr. declared for the 2022 NBA draft, where he was selected 28th by the Golden State Warriors, becoming the first player in program history to be selected in the first round.\n2022–Present: Bart Lundy era.\nOn March 18, 2022, the Panthers hired Bart Lundy, a successful Division II coach at Queens (NC), as the team's next head coach. In Lundy's first season, the Panthers won 20 regular season games for the first time since 2004-05, finishing second in the Horizon League before losing in the semifinals of the conference tournament to Cleveland State. Milwaukee accepted an invite to the 2023 College Basketball Invitational, their first postseason appearance since the 2014 NCAA tournament. The Panthers defeated Stetson in overtime in the first round, marking their first postseason tournament victory since 2006, before losing to eventual champions Charlotte in the quarterfinals. In 2023-24, despite high hopes, the Panthers struggled through much of the season, mainly due to injuries to key players. The team still rallied to advance to the Horizon League Championship game before losing to Oakland, finishing 20-15, which was also the first time since 2006 that the Panthers had consecutive 20-win seasons. Lundy also became the first coach in the program's history to have 20-win seasons in each of his first two seasons coaching the team.\nPostseason.\nNCAA Division I Tournament results.\nThe Panthers have appeared in the NCAA Division I tournament four times.

He finished his career in Italy in 2012 playing for Petrarca Padova.\nInternationally, Walsh played for the Australian Sevens team for several seasons on the Sevens World Series circuit, and captained the team.\nCoaching.\nWalsh became head coach of the Australia women's national rugby sevens team in 2013, and qualified the team for the 2016 Olympic Sevens tournament. The women's team went on to win the gold medal, defeating New Zealand 24–17 in the final. \"It's an Olympics sport and we're very successful at it.\" Walsh said after the medal ceremony.\nIn September 2015, he took over as interim Head Coach of the Australia men's sevens team for their Olympic qualification campaign, following the resignation of Geraint John. After the 2018 Commonwealth Games, he took over the head coaching position of the men's team. In 2022 he swapped roles with John Manenti and became head coach of the Australian women's sevens team again."

        "text": "At the 2005 East Asian Games, the athletics events were held at the Estádio Campo Desportivo in Macau, People's Republic of China from 1–4 November. A total of 45 events were contested, of which 23 by male and 22 by female athletes. China easily topped the medal table, winning 26 of the 45 available gold medals and accounting for half of the total female medallists. Japan won 46 medals, 16 of them gold, while South Korea was a clear third with a total of 21 medals. No athletes from either Guam or Mongolia reached the podium.\nDuring the four-day competition, a total of 11 East Asian Games records were broken. Among these were Liu Xiang's 13.21 seconds run in the 110 metres hurdles and a 20.06 m throw in the shot put from Zhang Qi (who had set a Chinese record some weeks earlier). The 2000 Olympic Champion Wang Liping brought her career to a close with a final gold in the 20 km race walk.\nA total of six athletes medalled in multiple individual events: Yuki Nakamura won both the men's 5000 and 10,000 metres events, while Hiromi Ominami won two silvers on the women's side. Lee Duhaeng took 10,000 m silver and 5000 m bronze, Bae Hae-Jin did a bronze double in the 1500/5000 m, and Chen Fu-Pin won the 800 metres silver and 1500 m bronze. In the field events, Yuka Murofushi won bronze in both the discus and hammer throws.\nWhile the large majority of events featured performances of an international standard, some competitions fell far short of the level expected of a regional games event. Many of Japan's top athletes were absent and a number of Chinese competitors had peaked earlier at the 10th Chinese National Games in Nanjing. Only one athlete (Takuro Mori) managed to clear the bar in the whole of the men's pole vault contest, while Hou Fei took bronze in the men's hammer with a small throw of 37.14 (almost half that of the winner). In the women's 4×400 metres relay Macau's bronze medal time of 4:05.61 was over thirty seconds slower than the winning team, and some 50 seconds off the world record time. Furthermore, the distances races were criticised for their slow pacing, the men's 10,000 bronze medalist running slightly slower than the women's bronze medalist."

They play their home games at Seddon Park, Hamilton. They compete in the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield one-day competition and also the Women's Super Smash Twenty20 competition, where they are known as the Northern Brave.\nHistory.\nNorthern Districts joined the New Zealand women's domestic structure in 1999–00, finishing bottom of the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield in their first year of competing. Northern Districts have consistently been one of the poorest performers in both the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield and the Twenty20 Super Smash, which began in 2007–08, and are the only current side to have not won a trophy. \nNorthern Districts' best finish in the Super Smash came in its inaugural season, when they finished 3rd with 3 wins. In 2019–20, they reached the final of the Hallyburton Johnstone Shield, but lost by 67 runs to Auckland, despite batter Felicity Leydon-Davis scoring 124. Northern Districts' Caitlin Gurrey was the leading run-scorer across the whole tournament, with 576 runs. In 2020–21, the side finished 4th in both competitions, with 5 wins in the Shield and 3 in the Super Smash.\nOn 9 October 2021, it was announced that the Northern Districts Cricket Association were combining the brands of the men's and women's teams for the Super Smash, with both teams becoming known as Northern Brave.\nGrounds.\nNorthern Districts' first match was played at St Paul's Collegiate Ground. Their primary ground soon became Westpac Trust Park, Hamilton, as well as using Wintech Park in the same city.\nFrom 2005, Northern Districts began using Blake Park, Mount Maunganui (later Bay Oval) as their main home ground, as well as later using Cobham Oval, Whangarei and returning to Westpac Trust Park, now renamed Seddon Park. The side has also occasionally used St Peter's School, Cambridge, as well as returning to St Paul's Collegiate Ground. In 2021–22 and 2022–23, they played the majority of their home games at Seddon Park, as well as playing at Bay Oval and at Cobham Oval. \nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nBased on squad announced for the 2023–24 season.

They have also attempted to qualify for the FIFA World Cup 15 times, with their first attempt being in 1966 when they lost to South Korea.\nIn Australia's first appearance in 1974, representing OFC, a team made up entirely of amateurs secured a scoreless draw against Chile, though they eventually departed from the tournament without a goal to show for their inaugural appearance. Australia made up for lost time at Germany 2006 and qualified for the Round of 16 before narrowly falling to eventual champions Italy. The German theme continued at South Africa 2010 although this time Australia, now representing the AFC, suffered a 4–0 loss against the European giants in a scoreline which ultimately scuppered their progress. A ten-man 1–1 draw against Ghana and a 2–1 win against Serbia saw Australia eliminated on goal difference, three goals off the Africans. Australia were to lose all three games in a tough group at Brazil 2014. In the Qatar 2022 edition, Australia made it to the last 16 for only the second time, before falling 2–1 to Argentina, which, like what happened to 2006 Italy, Argentina would eventually claim the World Cup title in 2022.\n2006 FIFA World Cup.\nGroup F.\nNote 1: Šimunić was given three yellow cards in the match: the referee (Graham Poll) failed to send him off the pitch after the second yellow, and was only red carded after the third yellow."

        "text": "The Northern Ireland national football team have appeared in the finals of the FIFA World Cup on three occasions.\nTheir best World Cup performance was in their first appearance in the finals, the 1958 World Cup, where they reached the quarter-finals after beating Czechoslovakia 2–1 in the play-off. They were knocked out by France, losing 4–0. In the 1958 competition Northern Ireland became the least populous country to have qualified for the World Cup, a record that stood until Trinidad &amp; Tobago qualified for the 2006 World Cup. Northern Ireland remains, however, the least populous country to have qualified for more than one World Cup finals tournament, to win a World Cup finals match, to have scored at a World Cup finals, and to have progressed from the first round of the World Cup finals.\nCaptain of the national side at the 1958 World Cup was Danny Blanchflower, who also captained Tottenham Hotspur in the English league and was twice footballer of the year in England. His younger brother Jackie was also a key member of the national team, and won two league titles in England with Manchester United, until his career was ended by injuries suffered in the Munich air disaster of February 1958.\nDespite the presence of world class forward George Best, another Manchester United player, for most of the 1960s and into the 1970s, Northern Ireland failed to qualify for any major tournaments during this time.\nNorthern Ireland also qualified for the 1982 World Cup. Their opening game was against Yugoslavia at the La Romareda in Zaragoza. It was the international debut of 17-year-old Norman Whiteside who became the youngest player ever in the World Cup finals, a record that still stands. The game finished goalless. Five days later they drew 1–1 with Honduras, which was a disappointment, and many believed had doomed Northern Ireland's chances of advancing in the competition. They needed a win against hosts Spain in the third and final group game at the Mestalla Stadium in Valencia. They faced a partisan atmosphere with a mostly Spanish crowd and a Spanish speaking referee in Héctor Ortiz who was unwilling to punish dirty play from the Spanish players. However a mistake from goalkeeper Luis Arconada gifted Gerry Armstrong the only goal of the game, and despite having Mal Donaghy sent off on 60 minutes, Northern Ireland went on to record an historic 1–0 win and top the first stage group.\nA 2–2 draw with Austria at the Vicente Calderón Stadium meant that a win against France would take them into the semi-finals, however a French team inspired by Michel Platini won 4–1 and eliminated Northern Ireland from the competition.\nIn the 1986 World Cup, they reached the first round.

        "title": "Concerns and controversies at the 2010 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "A number of concerns and controversies at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, surfaced before and during the Games, and which received media coverage.\nSafety.\nDeath of Georgian athlete Nodar Kumaritashvili.\nHours before the opening ceremony, Nodar Kumaritashvili of Georgia was killed during a training run for the luge after he was thrown from his sled and struck a steel pillar at high speed, near the end of the course. The International Luge Federation called an emergency meeting after the accident, and all other training runs were cancelled for the day.\nVancouver Olympics Organizing Committee (VANOC) was criticized after members of the media assumed that VANOC was the governing body that conducted a prompt 12-hour investigation into the luger's death, which put the blame on the luger. In fact, it was the International Luge Federation (ILF) which conducted the investigation. The ILF had stated that it would investigate the crash and issue a report around the end of March 2010.\nFurthermore, the Whistler Sliding Centre, which had recorded some of the fastest speeds in luge history, was the site of several non-fatal accidents during training runs leading up to the start of the games. For more than a year prior to the Olympics, luge competitors had complained that the track was too fast and the turns were too dangerous. Athletes had nicknamed turn 13 the \"50-50\" turn for their chances of getting through it without crashing. Kumaritashvili was killed on turn 16, the last turn of the course.\nAs a result, the height of the wall Kumaritashvili surmounted was increased, with added wooden panels and padding. Officials also ordered changes to the layout of the final turn of the Whistler luge track, making it slower and safer, and moved the men's and women's luge starts down the track.\nKumaritashvili's teammate, Levan Gureshidze, did not race. He was on the official start list for the first run but withdrew, telling other racers he could not go on. He instead flew back to Georgia to mourn the loss of his teammate.\nAfter the starting gates were changed, competitors complained that the junior starting position enters the main track with a turn that is too tight, causing sledders problems at the beginning of their runs. Some have also complained that slowing the course has decreased the challenge and forced them to adjust their strategy.\nEleven months before the death of Kumaritashvili, VANOC chief executive officer John Furlong started to be concerned that an athlete could get \"badly injured or even worse\" on the luge track. Josef Fendt, who was the President of the International Luge Federation, stated in a letter to the designer of the luge track that luge track was recording \"historic sled speeds\" that the speeds were nearly 20 kilometres an hour faster than the track designer had anticipated. John Furlong received a copy of the letter and asked for the situation to be looked at by the \"legal guys\". Svein Romstad, general secretary of the International Luge Federation, stated that the International Luge Federation \"would have sought major changes to the Whistler track if it had known ahead of time that speeds would be so much higher than calculated.\" A memo dated January 30, 2006, stated that, in March 2005, the International Luge Federation wanted major changes to six curves on the luge track including curves 15 and 16, where Kumaritashvili's problem began. Kumaritashvili's father became angry after reports showed that VANOC didn't act on their own concerns about the luge track's safety. The family of Kumaritashvili received an insurance payout worth $150,000 from the VANOC.\nVANOC broke some rules in regards to the luging and bobsleigh track. International Luge Federation states that \"the length for a luge track must not exceed .\" G-force was critical in the accident that killed Kumaritashvili. The rules of the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation states that a g-force of 5 is the limit for the track. A g-force of 5.02 is possible for male lugers on the track in Whistler. The rules of the International Bobsleigh and Tobogganing Federation also state that \"to prevent the deterioration of the ice during warm, sunny periods, the finish straight should be shaded or covered.\" Part of what was to be considered in the shading of the finish straight was the safety of the athlete. The final straight was where the accident took place. Since the investigation and currently, sliders no longer start at the upper start area, they start downhill at the lower start: C1.\nThe President of Georgia, Mikheil Saakashvili, thanked the hosts for the way that they handled Kumaritashvili's death, which included a moment of silence and a tribute at the opening ceremony.\nOther safety concerns.\nGiven Kumaritshvili's death on the 12th, other safety issues on speed for other events were raised at these games, most notably at the Sliding Centre. Another noted injury took place in the women's downhill. The course was labelled as extremely difficult for skiers and most training runs were cancelled due to weather conditions. This resulted in several accidents during the competition event where Sweden's Anja Pärson was badly bruised following a jump prior to the finish line of the event on February 17.\nIn cross-country skiing, Slovenian skier Petra Majdič was severely injured after a fall during a practice run on the sprint track. The fall led to Majdič sliding off the course and falling down a rocky slope. Despite having broken ribs and a collapsed lung, Majdič completed the women's sprint event and took the bronze medal. Slovenia filed a protest with the IOC about the safety of the course, but it was dismissed.\nSafety at LiveCity Vancouver.\nDozens were injured and sent to hospital when a barricade erected at LiveCity Yaletown collapsed. Canadian rock band Alexisonfire played a free concert at LiveCity Yaletown on Tuesday, February 16. Ten seconds into the band's first song, the crowd of hundreds surged forward, which caused a section of the barricade to collapse, sending dozens to the ground. The band stopped playing immediately, and asked the crowd to step back. While Vancouver Police and an on-site medical team controlled the situation, the crowd was informed that the show was cancelled, and they dispersed quickly and co-operatively.\nReports indicate at least 20 people were injured with 10 being taken to hospital. On February 17 the band issued the following statement: \"We are sincerely sorry that people were injured. We want to thank the security team, paramedics and police for their quick reaction. We especially want to thank our fans for cooperating and not making a bad situation worse.\" A representative for LiveCity Vancouver added, \"When the incident occurred, everyone acted quickly, professionally, and took appropriate action. The security and on-site emergency medical response teams provided immediate assistance and care, the band kept people calm, and the crowd dispersed safely.\"\nBilingualism.\nThe program of opening ceremony was criticized for a perceived lack of appropriate representation of French-speaking Canadians, in spite of Canada's status as a bilingual country. The Secretary General of La Francophonie, Abdou Diouf raised objections about the lack of bilingualism during the event, as French is alongside English as an International Olympic Committee official language. Quebec Premier Jean Charest said the ceremony failed to respect and reflect the francophone community in Canada. In an interview with CBC, the Minister of Canadian Heritage, James Moore, was \"disappointed\" by the low representation of French Canada during the ceremony. Canadian Member of Parliament Richard Nadeau of the Bloc Québécois sees rather a lack of political will to promote Canadian bilingualism. Among the 25,000 volunteers, only 15% of them spoke French. The Commissioner of the Official Languages, Graham Fraser, was very disappointed by the lack of presence of French. He also said, \"I had the impression of watching a show designed and produced in English with a French song. Even l\"'Hymne du Nord\" from the poet François-Xavier Garneau has been translated into English to be read by the actor Donald Sutherland\".\nVANOC, however, defended the case and said that they had made \"a very deliberate focus and effort to ensure a strong celebration of Quebec culture and language.\" They also said that there was a significant amount of French in the opening ceremony. David Atkins, the artistic director of the opening ceremonies, said that the ceremonies did celebrate francophone Canada. Some examples of French include the speeches, the Olympic Hymn, and the officials' oath. John Furlong, VANOC CEO, IOC President Jacques Rogge, and Governor General Michaëlle Jean all addressed the crowd in English and French. Measha Brueggergosman performed the English version of the Olympic Hymn, but Dave Pierce, the music director for the games, had his associate, Donovan Seidle, compose and arrange it to have some of the stanzas performed in French. Michel Verrault, a speed-skating official, took the officials' oath in French.\nIn his official report on the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, Graham Fraser identified two causes for the lack of French in it. The first was a lack of understanding. The commissioner said that \"it was apparent that, in several areas, the official language requirements in the multi-party agreement signed by the organizing committee and Canadian Heritage were rather vague and unclear\". He also stated the secrecy traditionally given to the opening ceremony prevented the commissioner from making sure that Canada's linguistic duality was well-showcased in the show. In order to prevent such mistake for future major events held in Canada, such as the 2015 Panamerican Games, \"official language requirements must be specific and clear to ensure that organizing committees grasp the importance of linguistic duality, understand their official languages obligations and plan adequately.\" In early 2011, the Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages published guide based on the lessons learned at the Vancouver Games to help federal institutions and organizing committees of future large-scale sporting events to better understand, plan, implement, and monitor their activities toward the full respect and inclusion of English and French.\nIn February 2011, one year following the Vancouver games, Furlong discussed the language controversy in the Olympics in his book \"Patriot Hearts: Inside the Olympics that Changed a Country\". Furlong said he had received praise from Fraser before the opening ceremony because of his large number of bilingual staff. He added that he had attempted to have the Quebec Anthem \"Mon Pays\" sang at the ceremony as well, but was shot down by the song's author. Furlong defended his refusal to apologise for the perceived lack of French in the opening ceremony. He alleged that, when discussing the place of French at the Olympics, \"Mr. Fraser pointed fingers from a distance but rarely pitched in with ideas or support.\" Fraser answered these criticism, saying that his office had given him precise indications and ideas to promote linguistic duality during the games, which were implemented. He said that, overall, the services in the Games were provided in both official languages, and that the absence of French was mostly in the cultural program, and this was the only part he took issue with. Following the release of Furlong's book on the 2010 Games, La Presse editor André Pratte wrote a severe opinion piece on the lack of French in the opening ceremony, noting that \"just trying is not good enough.\"\nH1N1 pandemic.\nThere were concerns that the H1N1 virus could spread among spectators, staff and athletes during the Games. Organizers were stockpiling vaccine and placed a high priority on vaccinating all volunteers. While each country was responsible for the vaccination of its own athletic delegation, Vancouver health officials and the International Olympic Committee strongly recommended that all athletes, spectators and other visitors be vaccinated. Some Olympic Committees required their delegations to be vaccinated against the H1N1 flu. In light of concerns, local British Columbia health officials vaccinated participants and spectators free of charge for the duration of the Games.\nWomen's ski jumping.\nThe IOC voted in 2006 not to include women's ski jumping in the 2010 Games on the grounds that the sport was not yet developed enough and did not meet basic criteria for inclusion. The members of the Canadian Women Ski Jumping Team filed a grievance with the Canadian Human Rights Board citing gender discrimination.\nAccording to lobby group Women's Ski Jumping USA, a group composed of \"some of the top women ski jumpers\" filed a Statement of Claim with the Supreme Court of British Columbia suing the Vancouver Olympic Organizing Committee for excluding women ski jumpers from the Vancouver games claiming that their rights were violated according to the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. However, on June 10, 2009, the Supreme Court ruled against the group, stating that, though the women were being discriminated against, the responsibility belonged to the IOC, who was not covered by the Charter, \"In other words, VANOC is not under a duty to distribute equally what it has no power to provide,\" nor even did the Charter apply to VANOC itself (though it did apply to any services VANOC provided on behalf of the Canadian or B.C. governments).\nVancouver Olympic Village.\nTwo Olympic Villages were built: one in Vancouver and the other in Whistler, as the snow and sliding events were held at the resort. While the indoor events were held in the host city itself.\nThe Vancouver 2010 Olympic Village was located at Southeast False Creek and originally planned to be a model sustainable community, with state-of-the-art energy efficiency provisions, and a mix of market and social housing, at one third market, one third social housing and one third subsidized middle income housing. The city of Vancouver would break even through the sale of market housing. However, a new city council was elected in 2005 and dropped the provisions for subsidized middle income housing and then sold the lands to a private developer for C$193 million. Further controversy erupted when the private developer and its associated investment company backed out of the project, forcing the city of Vancouver to bear the liability, which resulted in the resignation of a city planner in protest and saw the city seek special legislation making changes to its charter to allow it to borrow money to finance completion of the project.\nAustralian Team Kangaroo flag.\nLeading up to the Games, the International Olympic Committee had ordered the removal of a two-story high Australian Boxing Kangaroo flag which had been draped over a balcony in the athletes' village. The IOC ordered the flag to be taken down because they believed the image to be too commercial as it is a registered trademark (albeit of the Australian Olympic Committee). The order for removal was later withdrawn after IOC president Jacques Rogge met with AOC president John Coates.\nOpening ceremonies program.\nOn August 22, 2008, \"The Globe and Mail\" reported that after the budget for the ceremonies exceeded initial forecasts, the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper mandated that the content of the opening ceremonies reflect its agenda as a condition of its contribution of C$20 million to fund the event. This was widely criticized as government interference with the arts and exercising ideological control. However, VANOC vice-president of communications Renée Smith-Valade said the government was not bringing politics into the 2010 games and did not have veto power over any part of the Olympic ceremonies.\nSecurity violation.\nA mentally ill man from British Columbia was able to use a homemade all-access pass at the opening ceremonies to clear several layers of security at BC Place Stadium and get close to U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, who authorities say the man had an infatuation with. Before he could reach Biden, however, he was stopped by two plainclothes Mounties, who escorted him away. The man will not face charges, but has been committed to a psychiatric facility. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) said it has not implemented any change in security at the Olympics following the breach.\nCo-optation of lines from national anthem.\nVANOC used lines from the Canadian national anthem to serve as the official slogans for the games (\"with glowing hearts\" in English and \"des plus brilliants exploits\" in French) and trademarked their use. However, VANOC stated it would only challenge usage of the lines in the case of ambush marketing, where an attempt is made to \"create a specific, unauthorized commercial association with the 2010 Winter Games\". The anthem itself is in the public domain. \nTrademark enforcement.\nVANOC also began protecting its brand as contractually obligated by the IOC and its marketing partners, filing lawsuits against residents attempting to register domain names related to the games, and preventing Vancouver author Kari-Lynn Winters from portraying the Olympics in a work of fiction. The VANOC also sued local businesses for using \"olympic\" in their names, including already-existing and long-established businesses. The House of Commons also passed laws granting protection for various terms surrounding the games.\nCivil rights and Integrated Security Unit.\nIn June 2009, the Olympics Resistance Network accused the Vancouver 2010 Integrated Security Unit's (VISU) Joint Intelligence Group of \"abusive and unlawful conduct\" after allegedly harassing VANOC opposition activists. Concerns over policing methods have also been raised because of the head of Olympic security, RCMP Asst. Commissioner Gary Russell \"Bud\" Mercer, was part of the RCMP forces that blew up a truck in course of the Gustafsen Lake Standoff. Mercer was also among the RCMP who pepper-sprayed protests at the 1997 APEC conference at University of British Columbia, personally spraying a CBC cameraman and his camera, and also was part of the \"War in the Woods\" against tree-sit protesters in the Elaho Valley.\nIn October 2009, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia through the \"Miscellaneous Statutes Amendment Act, 2009\", gave host municipalities (Richmond, Vancouver and Whistler) the power to enter residences and other private property to seize signs that are deemed to be \"anti-Olympic\", between February 1 and March 31, 2010. Another amendment changed the Vancouver Charter to allow for fines of up to $10,000 and imprisonment for up to 6 months for sign and bylaw violations.\nPrivacy rights advocates, including Chantal Bernier, Assistant Privacy Commissioner of Canada, were concerned about the implementation of 900 security cameras placed by the RCMP Olympic Integrated Security Unit plus another 100 security cameras placed by the city of Vancouver in the Downtown area.\nForeclosure of Whistler resort owner Intrawest.\nCreditors holding $1.4 billion in debt on Intrawest, the owners of the Whistler Blackcomb Resort, were reported on January 20, 2010, as being ready to foreclose on the resort as part of the creditor, investment bank Lehman Brothers, attempting to recover debts owed it by major creditors, including Fortress Investments, the owner of Intrawest and Whistler Blackcomb since 2006. Despite guarantees from VANOC and the Canadian government of $50 million to keep Intrawest afloat during the Games, there were doubts that the Canadian government would be forthcoming. A private source connected to Wesley Edens, owner of Fortress Investments, has said that Edens may exercise his right in that circumstance to prevent the Games from happening at the resort. VANOC sources said this is unlikely to happen since the creditors would have no reason to diminish the value of the resort that would be enhanced by hosting a prestige event, and also because of the short time-frame of the impending Games relative to the length of the legal proceedings of any auction of Fortress' assets. Fortress is also the company which backed out of the original funding arrangements for the Athletes' Village in Vancouver, and the re-financing of that project by emergency legislation and the involvement of Fortress' subsidiary, Millennium.\nFailure of ice resurfacers.\nThe men's 500 metres speed skating event was delayed for over an hour at the Richmond Olympic Oval when both ice resurfacers experienced mechanical failures and a third ice machine was unable to resurface the ice properly. At least one skater withdrew from the race because of the delay and other racers stated that the delay hurt their race times.\nIce resurfacers at the games were supplied by Olympia, an official sponsor of the games. The Olympia Celletwi model is the first pollution-free, nickel-cadmium, battery-powered ice resurfacer and was selected as a part of the games \"green\" efforts. Following the failures, a traditional natural gas powered resurfacer built by Zamboni was brought in from Calgary. Organizers stated safety concerns for the decision.\nTicketing.\nAbout 28,000 tickets for spectator places along the slopes of a number of outside events were recalled for safety reasons; ticket holders were reimbursed but had difficulty or were not able to gain access to tickets at comparable prices to these events. Visitors were also upset by a twenty dollar charge to attend ceremonies to honour medal-winning athletes. Traditionally,during the Games previous editions these ceremonies had been free of charge. Organizers also expressed concern about blocks of VIP tickets going unused leaving conspicuous empty seats at events.\nIn May 2010, VANOC announced that 200 people had to be reimbursed due to alleged fraudulent ticket purchases by a group of Latvians in the province who used compromised credit card information. The cost to VANOC was estimated at $2 million.\nOfficiating errors.\nObservers and participants reported that several starter errors occurred during the February 16 men's biathlon pursuit. Competitors Jeremy Teela and Jean-Philippe Leguellec were started too early, before racers who were seeded higher than them. Teela stated that the early start threw off his strategy, contributing to his missing two targets in his first two shooting range stops. Teela said, \"We have a couple more races this week. Hopefully the organizers figure this problem out and they make the races fair.\"\nStarter confusion was also present during the women's pursuit earlier that day. This time both Liudmila Kalinchik and Anna Carin Olofsson-Zidek were held back and had to start several seconds too late. U.S. coach Per Nilsson stated that he had never seen an Olympic biathlon as poorly managed as the February 16 women's race.\nInternational Biathlon Union (IBU) officials were directing the starts. The incorrect starts were attributed to a Swiss official at the women's start and a Czech official at the men's start. Norbert Baier, technical delegate for the International Biathlon Union, called it the worst day of his career and took full responsibility, stating that the mistakes were their fault. He also noted that similar incidents have previously occurred on the World Cup circuit in Europe. Notably, at the previous year's World Championships in Pyeongchang, South Korea, several competitors were sent out the wrong way on the first lap.\nOlympic Cauldron.\nThe opening ceremony was stalled while organizers recovered from mechanical problems that prevented the pillars forming the cauldron for the torch lighting from completely rising out of the stadium floor as planned. However this was soon fixed as seen in the Closing Ceremony, where they made a joke out of it. An Engineer Mime climbed out of the stage as if he had just fixed it and he pretended to pull it up. Speed skater Catriona Le May Doan, who was supposed to have lit the 4th pillar, came out from the floor to finally get the chance to light it.\nTransportation.\nAfter problems with malfunctioning buses and lost drivers delayed spectators trying to go to or return from Olympic venues, the games organizers called in an additional 100 buses and drivers. The problematic buses and drivers were contracted from Gameday Management, an American company that had also serviced the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. Representatives of BC bus drivers and companies criticized VANOC for using Gameday and its American drivers instead of local operators, contending that drivers from states such as Texas were not experienced with mountain driving and winter road conditions.\nOwn The Podium—2010.\nOwn the Podium—2010 / \"À nous le podium en 2010!\" was a Canadian sport technical program launched in January 2005 to prepare Canada to become the top winter sporting nation in the world by the 2010 Winter Olympics. The main aspect of the scheme that caused controversy was the priority of Canadian competitors in conducting practice runs of events, particularly at the Whistler Slide Centre, over competitors from other countries. Several of the country's former Olympians criticized the program as unsportsmanlike, while others noted that program organizers seemed oblivious to principles of good sportsmanship enshrined by the founder of the modern Olympics, Pierre de Coubertin. It had been typical in past Olympics for the host nation to allow foreign athletes to train on the courses for a certain amount of time (e.g. the U.S.A. allowed Canadian athletes to train in Salt Lake in 2002). The amount of time provided to foreign athletes for training in fact met if not exceeded the requirements of each sporting federation. An International Luge Federation official stated that more pre-Games training time had been secured than at any previous Olympic Games Canadian officials also pointed out instances at the 2002 and 2006 Olympic Games where the host Organizing Committee restricted access to its own venues; in particular among these, luge athlete Jeff Christie stated that foreign athletes were given less training time than required at the 2006 Turin Olympics.\nCanadian women hockey players seen drinking and smoking.\nSome minutes after winning their gold medal in the finals of the women's hockey tournament, a 2-0 victory over the United States on February 25, 2010, several members of the Canadian women's hockey team celebrated on the Canada Hockey Place ice while drinking beer and champagne and smoking cigars. Unbeknownst to the players, they had been photographed; their celebration was then criticized in the US media, the reason being that smoking and drinking in public was unbecoming of Olympic athletes, especially while in uniform and in their playing venue. Hockey Canada issued an apology, although other members of the Olympic community dismissed concerns over the event. The IOC considered looking into the incident. Canadian hockey captain Hayley Wickenheiser said a double standard was being applied since a male athlete would not have been judged so harshly, as was the case with skeleton gold medalist Jon Montgomery's post race beer consumption.\nHuman Rights.\nThe opposition to the 2010 Winter Olympic Games was expressed by various activists, politicians and communities.\nIndigenous people.\nThere was opposition to the Olympics amongst some indigenous people and their supporters. Although the Lil'wat branch of the St'at'imc Nation is a co-host of the games, a splinter group from the Seton band known as the St'at'imc of Sutikalh, who had also opposed the Cayoosh Ski Resort, feared the Olympics were bringing unwanted tourism and real estate sales to their territory. On another front, local aboriginal people as well as Canadian Inuit expressed concern over the choice of an inukshuk as the symbol of the Games, with some Inuit leaders such as former Nunavut Commissioner Peter Irniq stating that the inukshuk is a culturally important symbol to them. He said that the \"Inuit never build inuksuit with head, legs and arms. I have seen inuksuit build [sic] more recently, 100 years maybe by non-Inuit in Nunavut, with head, legs and arms. These are not called inuksuit. These are called inunguat, imitation of man.\" Local aboriginal groups also expressed annoyance that the design did not reflect the Coast Salish and Interior Salish native culture from the region the Games were being held in, but rather that of the Inuit, who are indigenous to the Arctic far from Vancouver. One chief, Stewart Phillip, President of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, also said that the design lacked dignity, comparing it to Pac-Man. Edward John, Grand Chief of the First Nations Summit, said some native leaders were so upset about the issue they were prepared to walk out of the unveiling ceremony. The aboriginal governments of the Squamish, Musqueam, Lil'wat and Tsleil-Waututh (the \"Four Host First Nations\"), on whose traditional territory the games were being held, signed a protocol in 2004 in support of the games.\nProtests.\nIn 2006, environmental protests at Eagleridge Bluffs in West Vancouver over the building of a new highway resulted in the arrest of over 20 people, and jail time for two local women, Betty Krawczyk and Harriet Nahanee. Harriett Nahanee, an elderly woman, died shortly after incarceration from medical conditions thought to be exacerbated by her time in jail. According to critics, despite claims of the \"greenest Olympics\" ever and statements about \"sustainability\", the 2010 Olympics would leave behind environmental damage.\nOn February 13, the first day of the Games, windows of The Hudson's Bay Company, an Olympic sponsor, were smashed in downtown Vancouver by protesters. Protesters had also vandalized branches of the Royal Bank of Canada, an Olympic sponsor, in Ottawa, Vancouver and Victoria.\nReasons behind the protests were outlined in the documentary film \"Five Ring Circus\" and Helen Jefferson Lenskyj's books \"Olympic Industry Resistance\" (2007) and \"Inside the Olympic Industry\" (2000). Concerns were raised about the expense to taxpayers, estimated in 2007 to be CAN$580 million. After the stock market crash of 2008, there had been increasing concerns that Games-related projects would not meet their economic targets. The Olympic Village development, for example, was originally intended to make a profit, but at least one critic estimated it would be millions in debt. Olympic organizers did not comment on this estimate. Also protested was the displacement of low-income residents and criminalization of the poor and homeless through policies designed to make the city appear cleaner. Critics also anticipated an increase in human trafficking for the purpose of forced prostitution. The city also have hosted the Expo 86,and the event led to the displacement of hundreds of residents in the Downtown Eastside area of the city, and the Expo 2010, where 18,000 families were displaced from the Shanghai area, the 2010 Winter Olympics could have a similar effect of displacing and criminalizing poor communities, while corporate sponsors made billions of dollars of profit at the expense of peoples' lives and homes."

        "title": "Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics",
        "text": "Figure skating at the 2014 Winter Olympics was held at the Iceberg Skating Palace in Sochi, Russia. The five events took place between 6–22 February 2014. For the first time at the Winter Olympics, a figure skating team event was held.\nRecords and firsts.\nThe following new ISU best scores were set during this competition:\nOther records and firsts:\nCompetition schedule.\nThe following is the competition schedule for all five events.\nControversies.\nAthlete selection.\nThe United States' selection of Ashley Wagner over Mirai Nagasu for the Olympic team caused some controversy as Nagasu finished ahead of Wagner at the 2014 U.S. Championships. The results at the pre-Olympic nationals often play a major role in the decision process but U.S. Figure Skating never stated that they would be the only results considered. Wagner was selected on the body of her work, instead of her performance at that event.\nThis was the first time that U.S. Figure Skating selected a skater who had competed in the pre-Olympic nationals and lost over another on who had also competed. On previous occasions, this was done for skaters who had been injured and unable to compete at nationals.\nThe selection of Evgeni Plushenko by the Russia Olympic Team for figure skating caused some controversy, as he had been beaten by Maxim Kovtun at the 2014 Russian Figure Skating Championships. Plushenko said he won’t participate in European Championships and will give spot at men's singles for Kovtun and he will participate in the team event only. ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta cautioned the Figure Skating Federation of Russia, \"If one of your skaters has sustained the same injury for years. You should not enter him or her.\" Plushenko skated strongly in the Short and Free Programs for the Team Event, however in the Men's individuals he withdrew right before the start of the Short Program which left host Russia without an entry since it was too late have Kovtun as a replacement. Russian figure skating officials defended the initial selection of Plushenko by noting that Kovtun had done poorly at international events.\nAllegations of votes swapping.\nFrench sports newspaper \"L'Équipe\", quoting an anonymous Russian coach, alleged that Russia and the United States would swap votes, with the U.S. voting for Russian athletes in pairs figure skating and team events and Russia voting for the U.S. in ice dance. The allegations were categorically denied by U.S. Figure Skating.\nLadies' singles figure skating results.\nImmediately after the final scores were announced, confirming Russia's victory, journalistic questions arose regarding whether Russian 17-year-old Adelina Sotnikova's performances deserved higher scores than the performances of 23-year-old Yuna Kim from South Korea. Questions over the judges, the judging system, and the anonymity of scores were also raised in the press.\nOfficial responses.\nOn 21 February 2014, the International Skating Union (ISU) issued a statement which asserted all rules and procedures were applied during the competition and that no official protest had been filed by any participating nation concerning the results of the competition. Such a protest must be done within 30 minutes of the event.\nISU's 21 February 2014 statement declaring their confidence \"in the high quality and integrity of the ISU judging system\". Adding \"judges were selected by random drawing from a pool of 13 potential judges\" and all nine judges on the free skating panel were from different nations.\nOn 10 April, the Korean Olympic Committee (KOC) and the Korean Skating Union (KSU) filed an official complaint with the ISU Disciplinary Commission (DC) concerning judging. The complaint was regarding \"the wrongful constitution of the panel of judges and the unjust outcome of the competition\". It requested that the DC conduct a thorough investigation, \"take appropriate disciplinary actions against the concerned individuals\", and institute corrective actions. On 14 April, the DC ruled the complaint inadmissible because a general request for investigation is not within DC's jurisdiction and the complaint was not addressed at an individual or federation as required.\nOn 30 April, the KOC and KSU filed a second official complaint with the DC. This time the complaint was against Alla Shekhovtsova and Figure Skating Federation of Russia (FSFR), specifically citing a hug Shekhovtsova shared with Sotnikova and Shekhovtsova's marriage to the current Director General of the FSFR. On 30 May, the DC dismissed the complaint. It ruled Shekhovtsova \"is not responsible for the judging panel's composition\", her marriage did not create a conflict of interest, and since Sotnikova initiated the hug, Shekhovtsova did not break any rules by responding.\nAs of June 2014, the KOC and KSU are considering appealing to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).\nOpinions.\n\"USA Today\" reported \"A high-ranking Olympic figure skating official … said the geographic makeup of the judging panel 'was clearly slanted towards … Sotnikova.'\" The free skating panel included two Russian officials, a Russian judge and a Ukrainian judge. Journalists questioned the appointments of Russian judge Alla Shekhovtsova, the wife of the former president and the current general director of Figure Skating Federation of Russia Valentin Piseev, and Ukrainian judge Yuri Balkov, who was suspended for a year after being caught on tape attempting to fix the ice dancing competition at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The technical panel, that oversees correct execution of elements, is headed by fellow Russian Alexander Lakernik. Shekhovtseva was photographed hugging Sotnikova in the arena, raising another question of bias. The detailed score sheet shows that one judge gave Adelina Sotnikova +3 grade of execution (GOE) on all except two elements. In contrast, the score sheet of short program shows that one judge gave Yuna Kim +0 grade of execution on her triple flip, of which the NBC commentator Tracy Wilson commented as 'another perfect flip'.\nJournalists and experts argued that scores given to Adelina Sotnikova were inflated both in the short and long programs. She was inexplicably scored above all others in the free program, where most believed she merited only 4th place in the phase behind Yuna, Mao Asada, and Carolina Kostner. Many among them cite that certain judges gave generous scores along with fellow Russian competitor Yulia Lipnitskaya. In particular, numerous +3 grade of executions were handed out to the two Russian skaters as well as nods in component scores compared to other skaters. Others noted that Sotnikova made a mistake by stepping out of one of her jumps which got a -0.9 grade of execution in the scorecards. Ryan Bradley, 2011 US champion, asked \"Are we just going to ignore that she botched the landing of her 3 jump and pretend she was perfect?\" There are also debates about whether Sotnikova's triple lutz had a wrong edge on takeoff and the triple toe loop in her first jumping pass was under-rotated. Neither error was flagged by the event's technical panel. Retired national-level figure skater Tim Gerber wrote a letter to the ISU, claiming that Sotnikova's triple triple combination jump should have received wrong edge and under rotation. Gerber also asserted that the step sequence levels were not correctly awarded for Kim and Sotnikova. He stated that Kim's step sequence should have received a level four (instead of three) and Sotnikova's step sequence should have received a level three (instead of four), as Sotnikova's step sequence elements in free skating didn't meet the requirements to get level four, and Kim's met the requirements enough to get level four.\nKatarina Witt, a two-time Olympic champion, stated \"I am stunned by this result, I don’t understand the scoring.\" Several experts have also pointed out how Kim and Kostner's programs have significantly better artistry, choreography and skill on ice that should translate to higher component marks to other skaters. One judge in the scoresheets gave out significantly lower marks to Kim and Kostner in the component marks. Sonia Garbato, seven-time Olympic figure skating judge and former high-ranking ISU official, wrote: \"No fair judge … could have awarded to Adelina higher marks in choreography, performance/execution, and interpretation of the music.\" Four-time world champion Kurt Browning also expressed his surprise at the results, declaring that he did not understand how Kim and Sotnikova could have been so close in the programme component scores. He also pointed out how Sotnikova had her component scores boosted compared to her previous programs Michael Weiss, a two-time world bronze medalist, wrote \"couldn't disagree more that Yuna and Sotnikova had basically same Component marks?..in Both short &amp; long? Home field inflation.\" Dick Button, two-time Olympic champion and longstanding skating analyst, commented: \"Sotnikova was energetic, strong, commendable, but not a complete skater.\"\nA petition in Change.org against the results of the event demanding an investigation and rejudgment has amassed over 2 million supporters breaking several web traffic records on the website.\nQualification.\nA total of 148 quota spots are available to athletes to compete at the games. A maximum of 18 athletes could be entered by a National Olympic Committee, with a maximum of 9 men or 9 women. An additional six quota spots were made available for the team event. A further ten team trophy quotas (two in each discipline) were distributed to countries qualifying for the team event, but not the discipline itself. This means up to a maximum of 158 athletes could partake.\nParticipating nations.\n149 athletes from 30 nations participated, with number of athletes in parentheses. Brazil and the Philippines made their Olympic debuts in the sport."

        "title": "2010 Clemson Tigers baseball team",
        "text": "The 2010 Clemson Tigers baseball team represented Clemson University in the 2010 NCAA Division I baseball season. The team played their home games at Doug Kingsmore Stadium in Clemson, South Carolina.\nThe team was coached by Jack Leggett, who completed his seventeenth season at Clemson.\nPreseason.\nOn January 28, 2010, the coaches in the ACC picked Clemson to finish second in the Atlantic Division behind Florida State. Overall, the Tigers were picked third behind defending ACC champion Virginia and Florida State, respectively.\nRegular season.\nClemson played Wright State and Dayton for the first time ever on the baseball diamond. The Tigers went 4–0 against the Dayton, Ohio schools, sweeping Wright State in a three-game series before winning a mid-week contest against Dayton in 10 innings.\nClemson won its annual series against archrival South Carolina for the first time since 2006 by taking two of three games against the Gamecocks. OF/DH Chris Epps won the Bob Bradley Award as the Tigers' MVP of the series, going 7-for-14 with two home runs, a double, six RBIs, six runs, two walks, and one steal. The March 6 contest at Fluor Field was the first game between both schools at that stadium and the 1st game played in Greenville since the 1990 season.\nOn April 21, 3B John Hinson tied a school record by hitting three home runs in a game during the Tigers' 22–4 victory over USC-Upstate.\nClemson played its first four-game weekend series since 1996 when they hosted Florida Gulf Coast, the first meeting between the schools. After dropping the first game in the series, the Tigers took the final three games from the Eagles.\nOn May 22, Clemson completed a three-game sweep of eventual ACC champion Florida State to win their second ACC Atlantic Division title. Both teams finished with an 18–12 conference record, but the Tigers won the tiebreaker due to winning the head-to-head matchup with the Seminoles.\nClemson played nine schools that made it to the 2010 NCAA tournament: (Coastal Carolina, Elon, Florida State, Georgia Tech, North Carolina State, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, Virginia Tech). The Tigers compiled a 14–13 record against these 9 schools. Outside of conference play, Clemson played 4 schools that had won a conference regular season or tournament championship (Charlotte, Coastal Carolina, Florida Gulf Coast, Wright State). The Tigers compiled a 6–3 record against these four schools.\nPostseason.\nACC tournament.\nClemson entered the ACC Tournament as the #2 seed by virtue of winning the ACC Atlantic Division (Virginia claimed the #1 seed by virtue of winning both the Coastal Division and the ACC regular season). The Tigers competed in the Pool B of round robin play, which included #3 seed Georgia Tech, #6 seed Virginia Tech, and #7 seed N.C. State. The Tigers dropped their first two games against the Wolfpack and Hokies (both were teams that the Tigers swept in the regular season) before winning their final game against the Yellow Jackets (who swept the Tigers during the regular season) to finish the tournament with a 1–2 record. Florida State, whom the Tigers swept to win the Atlantic Division crown, defeated N.C. State in the championship game to win the ACC Championship.\nWith their victory over Georgia Tech, Clemson became the first team to win 100 games in ACC Tournament history.\nNCAA tournament.\nClemson was awarded the #2 seed in the Auburn Regional of the 2010 NCAA tournament. On June 4, the Tigers opened regional play with #3 seed and Conference USA champion Southern Miss. The Tigers totaled 12 hits and used 6 runs in the sixth inning to top the Golden Eagles, 10–1. On June 5, Clemson faced #1 seed and host Auburn in a match-up of conference division champions (Clemson having won the ACC Atlantic title, while Auburn won the SEC West title). The ACC Tigers prevailed over the SEC Tigers, 5–2, behind a complete game performance by pitcher Casey Harman. The following night, however, Auburn won 11–10, using a three-run home run by Creede Simpson in the 9th inning to rally past Clemson and force a deciding championship game. On June 7, Clemson prevailed, using clutch hitting and timely plays on defense to defeat Auburn, 13–7, and win the Auburn Regional Championship. In the 1st inning of the championship game, two-sport standout Kyle Parker hit his 20th home run of the season, becoming the 1st Division I athlete to throw 20 touchdown passes in football and hit 20 home runs in baseball in the same academic year.\nClemson was named one of the eight schools to host a Super Regional, as the Tigers were paired up against Atlanta Regional champions, Alabama. The Crismon Tide knocked off #8 national seed (and Tiger ACC rival) Georgia Tech, which gave the Tigers the opportunity to receive its 1st super regional bid since 2006. In the 1st game of the super regional, the Crimson Tide used two errors in the 3rd inning to score 4 runs and jump out to a 5–0 lead, then held on to claim a 5–4 victory over the Tigers. In the 2nd super regional game, however, the Tigers jumped out to a 6–0 lead and never looked back, tallying 20 hits and 9 walks against Alabama's pitching staff in a 19–5 victory to force a deciding game 3 for a CWS berth. In game three, Clemson erased an early 1–0 deficit to take an 8–1 lead into the ninth inning and held of an Alabama rally to win 8–6 and earn a College World Series bid, the Tigers' eleventh overall and first since 2006.\nCollege World Series.\nBy virtue of the Super Regional win against Alabama, Clemson joined Arizona State, Florida, Florida State, Oklahoma, South Carolina, TCU, and UCLA in the 2010 College World Series. Clemson was the only team to advance to the CWS that was ranked lower than a #1 seed during regional play. On June 21, the Tigers defeated #1 national seed Arizona State, 6–3, in a game that was delayed to a 10:00 A.M. (CST) start time due to rain and lightning the previous evening. The Tigers used strong pitching performances by Casey Harman and Alex Frederick, along with great play on defense, to hold the Sun Devils to only three runs. Offensively, the Tigers took advantage of a poor outing by ASU starting pitcher Scott Blair and several defensive miscues en route to scoring 6 runs and totaling 14 hits. On June 22, the Tigers played the Oklahoma Sooners. They secured a 6–1 lead after 5 innings against the Sooners before play was stopped at 10:08 P.M. (CST) due to inclement weather. The game was resumed the following afternoon, with Clemson holding off a late Sooner rally to win 6–4. Clemson then went on to face in state rival South Carolina, dropping the next two games to the Gamecocks 5–1 and 6–4 to be eliminated from the tournament. South Carolina ultimately went on to win the tournament by beating UCLA twice in the finals.\nHonors and awards.\nAll-ACC 1st Team\nAll-ACC 2nd Team\nAuburn Regional All-Tournament Team"

        "title": "Beta skeleton",
        "text": "In computational geometry and geometric graph theory, a \"β\"-skeleton or beta skeleton is an undirected graph defined from a set of points in the Euclidean plane. Two points \"p\" and \"q\" are connected by an edge whenever all the angles \"prq\" are sharper than a threshold determined from the numerical parameter \"β\".\nCircle-based definition.\nLet \"β\" be a positive real number, and calculate an angle \"θ\" using the formulas\nFor any two points \"p\" and \"q\" in the plane, let \"R\"\"pq\" be the set of points for which angle \"prq\" is greater than \"θ\". Then \"R\"\"pq\" takes the form of a union of two open disks with diameter \"βd\"(\"p\",\"q\") for \"β\" ≥ 1 and \"θ\" ≤ π/2, and it takes the form of the intersection of two open disks with diameter \"d\"(\"p\",\"q\")/\"β\" for \"β\" ≤ 1 and \"θ\" ≥ π/2. When \"β\" = 1 the two formulas give the same value \"θ\" = π/2, and \"R\"\"pq\" takes the form of a single open disk with \"pq\" as its diameter.\nThe \"β\"-skeleton of a discrete set \"S\" of points in the plane is the undirected graph that connects two points \"p\" and \"q\" with an edge \"pq\" whenever \"R\"\"pq\" contains no points of \"S\". That is, the \"β\"-skeleton is the empty region graph defined by the regions \"R\"\"pq\". When \"S\" contains a point \"r\" for which angle \"prq\" is greater than \"θ\", then \"pq\" is not an edge of the \"β\"-skeleton; the \"β\"-skeleton consists of those pairs \"pq\" for which no such point \"r\" exists.\nLune-based definition.\nSome authors use an alternative definition in which the empty regions \"R\"\"pq\" for \"β\" &gt; 1 are not unions of two disks but rather lenses (more often called in this context \"lunes\"), intersections of two congruent disks with diameter \"βd\"(\"pq\"), such that line segment \"pq\" lies on a radius of both disks and such that the points \"p\" and \"q\" both lie on the boundary of the intersection. As with the circle-based \"β\"-skeleton, the lune-based \"β\"-skeleton has an edge \"pq\" whenever region \"R\"\"pq\" is empty of other input points. For this alternative definition, the relative neighborhood graph is a special case of a \"β\"-skeleton with \"β\" = 2. The two definitions coincide for \"β\" ≤ 1, and for larger values of \"β\" the circle-based skeleton is a subgraph of the lune-based skeleton.\nOne important difference between the circle-based and lune-based \"β\"-skeletons is that, for any point set that does not lie on a single line, there always exists a sufficiently large value of \"β\" such that the circle-based \"β\"-skeleton is the empty graph. In contrast, if a pair of points \"p\" and \"q\" has the property that, for all other points \"r\", one of the two angles \"pqr\" and \"qpr\" is obtuse, then the lune-based \"β\"-skeleton will contain edge \"pq\" no matter how large \"β\" is.\nHistory.\n\"β\"-skeletons were first defined by as a scale-invariant variation of the alpha shapes of . The name, \"\"β\"-skeleton\", reflects the fact that in some sense the \"β\"-skeleton describes the shape of a set of points in the same way that a topological skeleton describes the shape of a two-dimensional region. Several generalizations of the \"β\"-skeleton to graphs defined by other empty regions have also been considered.\nProperties.\nIf \"β\" varies continuously from 0 to ∞, the circle-based \"β\"-skeletons form a sequence of graphs extending from the complete graph to the empty graph. The special case \"β\" = 1 leads to the Gabriel graph, which is known to contain the Euclidean minimum spanning tree; therefore, the \"β\"-skeleton also contains the Gabriel graph and the minimum spanning tree whenever \"β\" ≤ 1.\nFor any constant \"β\", a fractal construction resembling a flattened version of the Koch snowflake can be used to define a sequence of point sets whose \"β\"-skeletons are paths of arbitrarily large length within a unit square. Therefore, unlike the closely related Delaunay triangulation, \"β\"-skeletons have unbounded stretch factor and are not geometric spanners.\nAlgorithms.\nA naïve algorithm that tests each triple \"p\", \"q\", and \"r\" for membership of \"r\" in the region \"R\"\"pq\" can construct the \"β\"-skeleton of any set of \"n\" points in time O(\"n\"3).\nWhen \"β\" ≥ 1, the \"β\"-skeleton (with either definition) is a subgraph of the Gabriel graph, which is a subgraph of the Delaunay triangulation. If \"pq\" is an edge of the Delaunay triangulation that is not an edge of the \"β\"-skeleton, then a point \"r\" that forms a large angle \"prq\" can be found as one of the at most two points forming a triangle with \"p\" and \"q\" in the Delaunay triangulation. Therefore, for these values of \"β\", the circle-based \"β\"-skeleton for a set of \"n\" points can be constructed in time O(\"n\" log \"n\") by computing the Delaunay triangulation and using this test to filter its edges.\nFor \"β\" &lt; 1, a different algorithm of allows the construction of the \"β\"-skeleton in time O(\"n\"2). No better worst-case time bound is possible because, for any fixed value of \"β\" smaller than one, there exist point sets in general position (small perturbations of a regular polygon) for which the \"β\"-skeleton is a dense graph with a quadratic number of edges. In the same quadratic time bound, the entire \"β\"-spectrum (the sequence of circle-based \"β\"-skeletons formed by varying \"β\") may also be calculated.\nApplications.\nThe circle-based \"β\"-skeleton may be used in image analysis to reconstruct the shape of a two-dimensional object, given a set of sample points on the boundary of the object (a computational form of the connect the dots puzzle where the sequence in which the dots are to be connected must be deduced by an algorithm rather than being given as part of the puzzle). Although, in general, this requires a choice of the value of the parameter \"β\", it is possible to prove that the choice \"β\" = 1.7 will correctly reconstruct the entire boundary of any smooth surface, and not generate any edges that do not belong to the boundary, as long as the samples are generated sufficiently densely relative to the local curvature of the surface. However in experimental testing a lower value, \"β\" = 1.2, was more effective for reconstructing street maps from sets of points marking the center lines of streets in a geographic information system. For generalizations of the \"β\"-skeleton technique to reconstruction of surfaces in three dimensions, see .\nCircle-based \"β\"-skeletons have been used to find subgraphs of the minimum weight triangulation of a point set: for sufficiently large values of \"β\", every \"β\"-skeleton edge can be guaranteed to belong to the minimum weight triangulation. If the edges found in this way form a connected graph on all of the input points, then the remaining minimum weight triangulation edges may be found in polynomial time by dynamic programming. However, in general the minimum weight triangulation problem is NP-hard, and the subset of its edges found in this way may not be connected.\n\"β\"-skeletons have also been applied in machine learning to solve geometric classification problems and in wireless ad hoc networks as a mechanism for controlling communication complexity by choosing a subset of the pairs of wireless stations that can communicate with each other."

        "title": "2009 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer won two Majors in 2009, the French Open, defeating Robin Söderling in the final, and Wimbledon, defeating Andy Roddick in the final. In addition, Federer made the two other Grand Slam finals, Australian Open losing to Rafael Nadal, and the US Open, losing to Juan Martín del Potro. Federer went on to win two Master Series 1000 tournaments: in Madrid over Rafael Nadal, and in Cincinnati over Novak Djokovic. He lost in one 500 level event final in Basel to Djokovic. During the year, Federer completed the Career Grand Slam by winning his first French Open title, and won a record fifteenth Grand Slam singles title, surpassing Pete Sampras's mark of fourteen.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard-court season.\nIn preparation for the Australian Open, Federer played two exhibition tournaments and one official tournament. He lost to Murray in the semifinals of the Capitala World Tennis exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi. He then lost in the semifinals of the ATP World Tour 250 series tournament in Doha, Qatar to Murray. Federer won the AAMI Classic exhibition in Melbourne, when he defeated Stanislas Wawrinka in the final.\nFederer defeated each of his first three opponents in straight sets at the Australian Open. In the fourth round, Federer rallied from two sets down to defeat Tomáš Berdych. Federer reached his record 19th consecutive Grand Slam semifinal by defeating eighth-seeded Juan Martín del Potro in the quarterfinals in only 80 minutes. In his 18th Grand Slam final, Federer was defeated by long-time rival Nadal in their first meeting on a hard court in a Grand Slam tournament. The match lasted over four hours, with Nadal victorious in five sets. Federer broke down in tears during the trophy presentation and struggled to make his runner-up speech. Federer blamed the defeat on a lack of rhythm in his first serve.\nFederer withdrew from the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships and from Switzerland's Davis Cup tie against the U.S. because of a back injury he sustained in late 2008. He stated it was \"a precautionary measure\" to make sure his back is \"fully rehabilitated ... for the rest of the 2009 season\". On 4 March, Federer's agent, Tony Godsick, announced that the Australian tennis coach Darren Cahill was working with Federer on a trial basis at Federer's training base in Dubai. One week later, Cahill opted out of the coaching position, citing the travel commitment needed.\nFederer played both of the ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournaments in the United States. At the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells, California, Federer lost to Murray in the semifinals. At the Sony Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Florida, Federer defeated his first three opponents in straight sets, after receiving a first round bye. In the semifinals against Novak Djokovic, Federer lost a match that included Federer's smashing his racket in frustration after missing a forehand approach shot by hitting it into the net, which is the same shot that cost him the 2008 Wimbledon final.\nClay season and French Open titles.\nAfter initially deciding not to participate, Federer accepted a last-minute wildcard entry at the Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, his first clay-court event of the year. He lost to Stanislas Wawrinka for the first time in the third round.\nIn the semifinals of the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome, another ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series event on clay, Federer lost to Djokovic for the first time on clay.\nFederer received a first-round bye in the Mutua Madrilena Madrid Open, the last ATP World Tour Masters 1000 series event on clay for the year. He defeated Nadal in the final. This ended Nadal's 33-match winning streak on clay, and for the second time Federer prevented Nadal from becoming the first man to win all three Masters Series on clay in the same year.\nIn the 2009 French Open, in a fourth-round encounter, Federer had to come back from two sets to love down to defeat Tommy Haas. He defeated Gaël Monfils in the quarterfinals to reach his 20th consecutive Grand Slam semifinal. He reached his fourth straight final in Paris by outlasting del Potro after coming back from 2–1 down. He won the French Open for the first time by beating Robin Söderling in the final. With this win, Federer equaled Pete Sampras's men's record of 14 Grand Slam titles and Ivan Lendl's record of 19 Grand Slam finals, and also became the sixth man in history to complete a Career Grand Slam. The call by Eurosport on match point was thus: \"Federer wins the French Open for the first time in his career; and in addition must surely be regarded now as the greatest male player of all-time.\"\nOwing to the overwhelming emotions and fatigue brought by the tournament, Federer withdrew from the Gerry Weber Open, his usual pre-Wimbledon tournament.\nGrass season: Channel Slam, and smashing the all-time record.\nFederer became the highest seed for Wimbledon, after defending champion Nadal withdrew from the tournament due to tendinitis. Federer defeated Lu Yen-hsun in the first round. He moved safely into the third round with a win over Guillermo García-López. In the third round, Federer defeated Philipp Kohlschreiber. Federer then booked a place in the quarterfinals by defeating Söderling. In the quarterfinals, Federer cruised past Ivo Karlović, to extend his all-time record of consecutive Grand Slam semifinals to 21. In the semifinals, Federer defeated Tommy Haas to reach his seventh consecutive Wimbledon final, an all-time record. With this win, he also reached his 20th Grand Slam final, surpassing the previous record of 19 set by Lendl. In a match that took 4 hours and 17 minutes to complete, he beat Roddick in the final in the latest chapter of their long, though lopsided rivalry, regaining the world no. 1 spot from Rafael Nadal. The 30 total games in the fifth set was a new Grand Slam record. The match was also the longest men's singles final (in terms of games played) in Grand Slam history, with 77 games played, and the fifth set alone lasted 95 minutes. The match has been called an \"instant classic\" by ESPN, and received the highest TV ratings in the UK for any Wimbledon final since 2001. With the win, he also became the fourth man in the open era to win both the French Open and Wimbledon in the same year (the \"Channel Slam\"), following Nadal in 2008, Borg in 1978–1980, and Laver in 1969. He also joined Nadal as the only players to simultaneously hold Grand Slams on clay, grass, and hard court (2008 US Open, 2009 French Open, 2009 Wimbledon).\nSummer hard-court season.\nFederer won his first match after a five-week break at the second round of the 2009 Rogers Cup against Frédéric Niemeyer following a first-round bye. He then defeated countryman Stanislas Wawrinka after coming back from three games down in the second set; in doing so, he made more history by contributing to the first occasion where the top 8 ranked men had all made the quarterfinals of a single tournament, joining the other seven players: Nadal, Murray, Djokovic, Roddick, del Potro, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and Davydenko. However, in the quarterfinals, he lost to Tsonga despite leading by four games in the final set.\nDespite the relatively early exit in Montreal, Federer started off well at the 2009 Cincinnati Open, beating José Acasuso in the second round (after having another bye in the first round like the other top seeds) and David Ferrer in the third round. He then beat Lleyton Hewitt in the quarterfinals, followed by Murray in the semifinals to reach the final, where he defeated Novak Djokovic.\nFederer began his US Open campaign well with a victory over unseeded Devin Britton. He advanced to the third round with a second-round win over Simon Greul. His third-round match was against Hewitt, against whom he lost his first set of the tournament, but eventually rallied to win the match. After this match, Federer held a 16–7 lead over Hewitt, continuing a fourteen match winning streak against him. Federer next defeated Tommy Robredo to book a quarterfinal berth against Robin Söderling for the third Grand Slam in a row, which he won in four sets after saving a set point in the fourth set. Federer reached his 21st Grand Slam final by defeating fourth seed Novak Djokovic for the third straight year. He triumphed and, in doing so, reached match point by performing a between-the-legs passing shot, which he later described as \"...the greatest shot I ever hit in my life.\" He lost to del Potro in the final in five sets. The loss broke Federer's streak of forty consecutive wins at the US Open. It also marked the first time Federer had lost in a Grand Slam final to an opponent other than Rafael Nadal.\nFall indoor season.\nFederer went on to play in the Davis Cup tie with Italy, and in his first match on the red clay courts at Valletta Cambiaso Club, in Genoa, won in a match against Simone Bolelli. He sealed Switzerland's qualification for the World Group with a victory over Potito Starace. Following the match, Federer was quoted as saying \"I was able to play very well. I have to go on holiday badly. I have a problem with my leg, I have a problem with my arm – everything is hurting. And I've got to do some baby-sitting.\" He later withdrew from the 2009 Japan Open and the Shanghai ATP Masters 1000.\nAt the Davidoff Swiss Indoors, Federer defeated Olivier Rochus, Andreas Seppi, Evgeny Korolev, and his childhood friend Marco Chiudinelli in straight sets, before losing in the finals to Novak Djokovic.\nFederer's next tournament was the Paris Masters, where his six previous appearances had never extended past the quarterfinals. After a first-round bye, Federer continued his Paris Open struggles with an early exit to second-round opponent Julien Benneteau.\nFederer's final tournament of the year was the 2009 ATP World Tour Finals. He beat Fernando Verdasco in the first of his round-robin matches, followed by a victory over Andy Murray, which secured him the year-end no. 1 ranking for the fifth year. However, he lost to del Potro once more, but he won enough games to qualify for the semifinals. In the semifinals, he met Nikolay Davydenko, who beat Federer for the first time in their 13 encounters. This loss ended Roger Federer's 2009 tennis season.\nThe year saw Federer accomplishing three major goals: winning his first French Open title, breaking Pete Sampras's record of 14 Grand Slam wins, and regaining the no. 1 ranking from Rafael Nadal."

        "text": "Roger Federer's 2010 season was punctuated by his victory at the Australian Open, beating Andy Murray in the final. Federer played in 18 tournaments in 2010 and won five. He was runner-up in the Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open to Rafael Nadal. At the French Open, he faced his opponent in the previous year's final, Robin Söderling, at the quarterfinals stage and lost. As defending champion at Wimbledon, he was defeated in the quarterfinals by Tomáš Berdych in four sets, thus ending his streak of seven consecutive Wimbledon finals and also falling to world No. 3, his lowest ranking since 2003. During the summer hard-court season, Federer hired Paul Annacone to be his coach and revive his form. At the 2010 US Open, Federer advanced to his seventh straight semifinal appearance, but lost to Novak Djokovic in five sets, despite holding two match points in the final set. Federer's ranking slipped back from No. 2 to No. 3 after the tournament, but he finished the year strong with victories in Stockholm, Basel, and the ATP Tour Finals to pass Djokovic in the rankings and finish the year at world No. 2. By the end of 2010, Federer had earned wide consideration as the greatest male tennis player of all time.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season and Australian Open.\nOn Sunday, January 17, Federer created a charity tournament called the \"Hit for Haiti\" at the Rod Laver Arena the day before the Australian Open. He invited a number of top world players from the ATP and WTA tours to join him to raise money for relief efforts in Haiti. The players who participated included Federer, Rafael Nadal, Andy Roddick, Novak Djokovic, Kim Clijsters, Serena Williams, Lleyton Hewitt, and Samantha Stosur. A few days before the start of Indian Wells, Federer, Nadal, 14-time Grand Slam singles champion Pete Sampras, and 8-time Grand Slam singles champion Agassi participated in a doubles exhibition match called \"Hit for Haiti 2\" as a fundraiser for the relief efforts in Haiti. Also in February, Federer made a trip to Ethiopia, where his charity foundation works.\nFederer started the year by playing in the Qatar ExxonMobil Open in Doha, where he was defeated in the semifinals by eventual champion Nikolay Davydenko.\nFederer won his 16th Grand Slam singles title at the Australian Open. In the fourth round, Federer beat Lleyton Hewitt in straight sets. In the quarterfinals, Federer trailed Davydenko by a set and two games in the second set, but was able to win in four sets. Federer then defeated world no. 10 and 2008 Australian Open runner-up Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the semifinals in straight sets. This marked the 23rd consecutive time that Federer had appeared in a semifinal of a Grand Slam tournament, and the seventh consecutive year that Federer had made at least the semifinals at the Australian Open, breaking the previous record held by Ivan Lendl. In the final, Federer defeated fifth-seeded Andy Murray in straight sets to claim his fourth Australian Open singles title. This win tied him for most Australian Open victories in the open era at four with Andre Agassi. Since Wimbledon 2005 Federer had made the finals of 18 out of 19 Grand Slam tournaments, an extraordinary period of sustained excellence unparalleled in the Open Era.\nFederer withdrew from the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships for the second consecutive year due to a lung infection.\nFederer then appeared at the BNP Paribas Open in Indian Wells for his first tournament since the Australian Open. Along with the 31 seeded players behind him, Federer received a first round bye in the main draw. However, in the third round, he was defeated by Marcos Baghdatis in a rematch of the 2006 Australian Open final, after Federer failed to convert three match points.\nThe week after Indian Wells, Federer played in the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami. Federer and the other 31 seeded players received first-round byes. In the second round, Federer defeated Nicolás Lapentti before over 14,000 fans, a record-breaking attendance for a second round match in the Stadium (the center court of Miami). After beating Florent Serra, Federer lost to the eventual runner-up, Czech Tomáš Berdych, in three sets in the fourth round. Federer hit 62 unforced errors in that match.\nClay court season and French Open.\nFederer next appeared in the Internazionali BNL d'Italia in Rome. In addition to singles, he teamed with Yves Allegro for the doubles competition as wildcards. The team lost in the quarterfinals to Sam Querrey and John Isner. Federer lost to world no. 40 Gulbis in the second round of the singles competition, after receiving a first-round bye. It was the first time since 2000 that Federer had lost his opening clay-court match of the year. It was the first time since 2002 that he had lost before the quarterfinals at three consecutive events, and the first time since 2002 that he had lost his first match in Rome.\nFederer then played the Estoril Open. In his only previous appearance in 2008, he won the title, when Davydenko retired in the final. However, he lost in the semifinals this year to Albert Montañés in straight sets, after which Federer said he was not worried by his current form, while Nadal expressed surprise at his rival's loss.\nFederer continued at the Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open, where he was the defending champion. He defeated his 2008 Olympic doubles partner Stanislas Wawrinka in the third round. In the quarterfinals, he avenged his earlier loss to Gulbis. In the semifinals, he defeated David Ferrer in three sets. Federer then lost to Nadal in the final in straight sets.\nIn the third round of the French Open, Federer beat Julian Reister to register his 700th ATP-level match victory and 150th on clay. He followed this milestone by defeating Wawrinka in the fourth round. Federer lost in the quarterfinals to Robin Söderling, ending his six-year streak of consecutive Grand Slam semifinals. Moreover, after the end of tournament, he lost the world no. 1 ranking to Nadal, leaving Federer at 285 weeks of being world no. 1, with Sampras holding the record of 286 weeks at that time.\nGrass court season and Wimbledon.\nFederer next played at the Gerry Weber Open, where he lost to Hewitt in the final in three sets. In doubles, Federer and Allegro lost in the first round to Christopher Kas and Philipp Kohlschreiber.\nNext, Federer attempted to defend his title at the Wimbledon Championships. Since Wimbledon has a different formula for seedings based on grass-court achievements, Federer was seeded first above world no. 1 Rafael Nadal. In the first round, Federer won for the 200th occasion in Grand Slam matches as he came from two sets down to beat Alejandro Falla, who served for the match in the fourth set at that time, but Falla took Federer to another set before Federer won in a quick fifth set. Federer beat Ilija Bozoljac in four sets. He next faced Arnaud Clément and had a straight-set victory. In the fourth round, Federer defeated no. 16 seed Jürgen Melzer. In the quarterfinals, he faced Tomáš Berdych, but lost in four sets. With this defeat, Federer became ranked no. 3 at the end of Wimbledon, which was his lowest ranking since November 10, 2003.\nUS Open Series and US Open.\nDuring Federer's summer break between Wimbledon and Canada, he hired Pete Sampras' old coach Paul Annacone to attempt to revive his fortune, to start with on a trial period. After beating Chela in his first match at the 2010 Rogers Cup, Federer broke Andre Agassi's record for Master level wins as he won his 210th match. Federer then overcame quarterfinal and semifinal challenges from Berdych and Djokovic respectively, winning the first set of both matches before dropping the second and having to fight hard to capture the decider. His triumph over Djokovic, the world no. 2, ensured that he would reclaim that ranking, regardless of the outcome of his final showdown with Murray, the defending champion. Federer lost in the final, 5–7, 5–7.\nA week later, Federer played in the 2010 Western &amp; Southern Financial Group Masters in Cincinnati, Ohio, still seeded third behind Nadal and Djokovic, but competing as world no. 2 for the first time since Wimbledon. He received a bye in the first round, and then got another break when Uzbekistan second-round opponent Denis Istomin was forced to retire in the first set. He advanced to the quarterfinals in a walkover, when Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany pulled out, citing a shoulder injury. He defeated frequent tour opponent and world no. 6 Nikolay Davydenko and advanced to the semifinals. He defeated Marcos Baghdatis and advanced to the finals. There he defeated Mardy Fish and successfully defended the title. Federer began his quest for a sixth U.S. Open title with an easy win over Brian Dabul. Federer next beat Andreas Beck. In the third round, Federer defeated Paul-Henri Mathieu. In the round of 16, Federer faced Roland Garros semifinalist Jürgen Melzer and won in straight sets. Then, in the quarterfinals, he faced Robin Söderling, who had recently beaten him in the quarterfinals of the 2010 French Open, and defeated him. He narrowly lost to Novak Djokovic in the semifinals after failing to convert two match points in the final set. As a result, Djokovic rose to no. 2 in the world and Federer fell to no. 3. By reaching the semifinals, Federer achieved his 20th match win in 2010 Grand Slams; this is the seventh consecutive year he has accomplished this feat, a record matched only by Ivan Lendl.\nAsian swing.\nFederer competed at the ATP Masters 1000 Shanghai, where he was seeded third and had a bye in the first round. Federer defeated John Isner and Andreas Seppi to advance to the quarterfinals, where he defeated world no. 5 Robin Söderling. He avenged his last US open loss against Djokovic. However, in the final, Federer fell to Murray.\nEuropean indoor season.\nHis next tournament was the Stockholm Open. He got a bye in the first round, defeated the American Taylor Dent in the next round, and defeated fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka afterwards. Up next in the semifinals was Ivan Ljubičić, whom Federer beat in two sets. Federer won his 64th Tour-level title, tying with Pete Sampras for fourth place on the Open Era titles list, as he beat Florian Mayer in the final to win his first Stockholm crown.\nHe next participated at the 2010 Davidoff Swiss Indoors as the top seed. He defeated Djokovic the final, to win a record fourth title at the event. This was his 65th career title, placing him fourth in the all-time list, surpassing Pete Sampras' record of 64 career titles. At the BNP Paribas Masters, Federer reached the semifinals for the first time, where he lost to Gaël Monfils despite holding five match points.\nAt the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals, Federer was placed in Group B, along with Andy Murray, Robin Söderling, and David Ferrer. He defeated Ferrer in his first round-robin match. He then defeated Murray and defeated Söderling in his final round-robin match. These straight-set wins marked the first time Federer completed the round-robin stage without dropping a set. He was the winner of Group B and qualified for the semifinals. In the semifinals, he beat Novak Djokovic to advance to his sixth year-end championship final, where he faced his longtime rival Rafael Nadal. Federer retained his unbeaten record against Nadal at the ATP World Tour Finals by defeating the top seed in the final. Federer then had five season-ending championships to his name, tying Pete Sampras and Ivan Lendl for the most ever. Federer ended the year ranked world No. 2 and played Nadal in two charity matches, one in Zürich and one in Madrid. The proceeds benefited his own foundation, as well as Nadal's foundation. By the end of 2010 he widely became considered as the greatest player of all time.\nMatches.\nAll matches.\nDoubles.\nSource (ATP)"

        "title": "Perfect 10 (gymnastics)",
        "text": "A perfect 10 is a score of 10.000 for a single routine in artistic gymnastics, which was once thought to be unattainable—particularly at the Olympic Games—under the code of points set by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG). It is generally recognized that the first person to score a perfect 10 at the Olympic Games was Romanian Nadia Comăneci, at the 1976 Games in Montreal. Other women who accomplished this feat at the Olympics include Nellie Kim, also in 1976, Mary Lou Retton in 1984, Daniela Silivaș and Yelena Shushunova in 1988, Lu Li and Lavinia Miloșovici in 1992. The first man to score a perfect 10 is considered to be Alexander Dityatin, at the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. (However, in the 1924 Paris Olympics, 22 men achieved a mark of 10 in rope-climbing, with Albert Séguin getting a second 10 in the sidehorse vault, events that are no longer part of artistic gymnastics.)\nThe FIG changed its code of points in 2006. There are now different top scores, all greater than 10, for the various events, based upon difficulty and artistic merit; there is no consistent perfect score. Execution scores are still out of 10, so the theoretical possibility exists for a gymnast to get a partial \"perfect 10\" (for execution) in addition to whatever maximum number they get for difficulty, but no such score has been awarded in decades.\nHistory.\nMen's artistic gymnastics had been an Olympic sport since the beginning of the modern games. Women's gymnastics were introduced as a single (team) event in the 1928 games, but were not expanded until the 1952 games, when there were seven events. The International Federation of Gymnastics first drew up a code of points—for men—in 1949.\nAlthough the code of points was based on a maximum of 10, until 1976 it was considered impossible to achieve a score of greater than 9.95, particularly at the Olympic Games. \nAt the World Championships or Olympics beginning when increased standardization of competition format and scoring (which was capped at a 10, a trend which would not be changed until 2006) was introduced at the 1952 Olympics, the very highest scores tended to be in the 9.400 – 9.600 range, and over the next few World and Olympic cycles through the 1950, 1960s, and 1970s, the top scores gradually got higher through the 9.700 and 9.800 range. \nDuring the post-1952 era, a couple of very early scores, essentially extreme outliers, that came very close to the 10.000 mark were Armenian-Soviet Hrant Shahinyan's score of 9.950 on optional rings at the 1952 Olympics and Armenian-Soviet Albert Azaryan's score of 9.950, also on the optional still rings exercise, at the 1954 World Championships. On the men's side, these scores might not have been surpassed, or even equaled, at a World Championships or Olympics until 1980, as even scores of 9.900 were extremely rare and, in some Worlds and Olympics throughout the 1950s −1970s, scores of 9.900 seem to have been non-existent for the men. \nOne early example of a woman gymnast breaking the 9.900 score barrier at a World Championships or Olympics in the post-1952 era was Soviet Larisa Latynina at the 1962 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships Another of the earliest was Soviet Zinaida Druzhinina-Voronina who scored a 9.933 at the 1966 World Championships in the Floor Exercise Event Finals, the very highest mark of any competitor at that competition. \nAn often glossed-over fact when discussing the Perfect 10 is that Věra Čáslavská of Czechoslovakia was the first gymnast to achieve perfect 10s at a major competition in the post-1952 era, which she did twice at the 1967 European Championships, which were displayed on a manual scoreboard. Prior to the 1976 Olympics in Montreal, Omega, the official timers, asked the International Olympic Committee how many digits it should allow on the electronic scoreboard, and were told that three digits would be sufficient, as a score of 10.00 would not be possible.\nOn 18 July 1976, 14-year-old Romanian gymnast Nadia Comăneci performed in the uneven bars event, and was awarded a score of 10. Because the scoreboard only allowed three digits, it had to display her score as 1.00. This led to confusion, with even Comăneci unsure of what it meant, until the announcer informed the elated crowd that she had scored a perfect 10. An iconic press photograph (pictured above) shows a beaming Comăneci, arms upraised, beside the scoreboard. Comăneci scored a total of seven 10s at the 1976 Olympics—four on the uneven bars and three on the balance beam. Her main rival, Soviet Nelli Kim, scored two 10s in the same competition, in the vault and floor exercise. Comăneci's coach, Béla Károlyi, having defected to the United States in 1981, subsequently coached Mary Lou Retton to gold at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, where she scored 10s in the vault and floor exercise.\nThe first man to score a perfect 10 in Olympic competition was the Soviet Alexander Dityatin, who received the score in the vault on the way to a record-breaking eight medals in the 1980 Olympics in Moscow. Among other men to achieve the score was Comăneci's future husband, Bart Conner, who received two 10s in Los Angeles in 1984.\nChange in scoring.\nThe code of points came under review as a result of separate incidents during the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, in which gymnasts were believed to have received excessively low scores. A new scoring system was introduced in 2006. It consists of an \"A\" score, based on the difficulty of elements, and a \"B\" score, based on artistic impression. While the B score still has a maximum of 10, it is only a part of the overall score.\nThe change had its share of critics. Béla Károlyi said of it: \"It's crazy, terrible, the stupidest thing that ever happened to the sport of gymnastics.\". Mary Lou Retton remarked: \"It's hard to understand. I don't even understand it.\" Nadia Comăneci commented, \"It's so hard to define sports like ours and we had something unique. The 10, it was ours first and now you give it away.\"\nList of perfect 10s.\n\"This list may be incomplete.\"\n\"Meta-Perfect\" Scores of 20, 30, and 40.\nAlthough virtually hundreds of perfect scores of 10 were given at various levels of competition throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, \"meta-perfect\" scores of 20, 30, or 40 were much, much more rare. A \"meta-perfect\" score would be an instance where a gymnast received multiple perfect scores of 10 throughout a competition on an apparatus (culminating in an official \"meta-perfect\" score of 20 in the Event Finals, depending upon the era and competition), or on every apparatus in a segment of a competition (which would result in an official \"meta-perfect\" score of 60 for a male gymnast or 40 for female gymnast, depending upon the era and competition). \nThree possible scenarios in which to create a \"meta-perfect score\", that have occurred, would then be: 1) to achieve perfect 10s on every apparatus throughout a segment of a competition (Team Compulsories, Team Optionals, or All-Around) which would post an official \"meta-perfect\" score of either 60 for the men or 40 for the women, depending upon the era and competition; 2) to achieve perfect 10s on all performances on an apparatus throughout every segment of a competition (Team Compulsories, Optionals, All-around, and Event Finals), which would officially post a \"meta-perfect\" score of 20 in Event Finals, depending upon the era and competition; and 3) to achieve perfect 10s on all optionals performances on an apparatus (team optionals, all-around (if competed in), event finals), which might or might not post an official \"meta-perfect\" score, depending upon the competition and era – but this is a possibly necessary scenario to articulate because perfect scores of 10 were given much less often to compulsory routines than to optional routines, for a number of reasons. Olga Mostepanova seems to have been the only gymnast to do #1 at a major international competition. Svetlana Boginskaya, Nadia Comăneci, Maxi Gnauck, Olga Mostepanova, and Daniela Silivaș are women who have done this more than once. Dmitry Bilozerchev has done this probably more (4) times than any other man.\nNo score of \"30\" (listed several times below) would ever have been an officially posted score to designate \"meta-perfection\" on an apparatus. This is merely a designation of either 1) \"meta-perfection\" on an apparatus in both phases of the team competition (compulsories and optionals) as well as event finals, but not in the all-around, and this is worth articulating relative to listed \"meta-perfect\" scores of 40 because the gymnast in question might not have qualified to the all-around, therefore no opportunity to achieve a theoretical \"meta-perfect\" score of 40/40; OR 2) \"meta-perfection\" on all optionals performance on an apparatus (see scenario #3, above)."

        "text": "The 2011 Australian Open was a tennis tournament featuring six different competitions, and part of the 2011 ATP World Tour, the 2011 WTA Tour, ITF Junior Tour and the NEC Tour, as tournaments for professional, junior and wheelchair players were held. The tournament took place at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia from 17 to 30 January, it was the 99th edition of the Australian Open and the first Grand Slam event of 2011. The tournament was played on hard courts and was organised by the International Tennis Federation and Tennis Australia.\nRoger Federer was unsuccessful in his title defence, being defeated by Novak Djokovic in the semi-finals, and Serena Williams was unable to defend her title due to a foot injury she suffered shortly after winning Wimbledon last year. Djokovic won the Australian Open for the second time, and Kim Clijsters, the runner-up to Justine Henin-Hardenne in 2004, won her maiden Australian Open. In the men's doubles the Bryan brothers won their fifth Australian Open while Gisela Dulko and Flavia Pennetta won their maiden Grand Slam title in the women's doubles. Daniel Nestor claimed his second mixed doubles Grand Slam alongside Katarina Srebotnik who won her fourth mixed title, her first Australian, leaving her one away from a career Grand Slam, as she has now won three of the Grand Slams, needing just Wimbledon to complete her collection.\nIn the junior tournaments both the singles and doubles titles in the boys and girls events were won by Jiří Veselý and An-Sophie Mestach. Vesely won the doubles alongside Filip Horanský whilst Mestach won her doubles crown with Demi Schuurs. Vesely and Mestach won their first Grand Slam titles and became the first players to achieve the junior double together in any Grand Slam since Kristian Pless and Virginie Razzano achieved this at the 1999 Australian Open.\nShingo Kunieda and Esther Vergeer both won the singles and doubles in the men's and women's wheelchair tennis events respectively. Kunieda won his fourth consecutive Australian Open, his fifth overall. In the doubles Kunieda was partnered to the title by Maikel Scheffers. Vergeer's singles win was her eighth Australian Open crown, her seventeenth overall, and the fourth time that she has not lost a game during a Grand Slam final. The win in the final was her 404th consecutive match win, she was partnered by Sharon Walraven in the doubles. In the Quad events David Wagner won the singles while Andy Lapthorne and Peter Norfolk took the doubles crown.\nTournament.\nThe 2011 Australian Open was the 99th edition of the Australian Open, held at Melbourne Park, in Melbourne, Victoria. The tournament was an event run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and Tennis Australia, that was part of the 2011 ATP World Tour and the 2011 WTA Tour calendars, under the Grand Slam category. The tournament consisted of men's and women's singles and doubles draws as well as a mixed doubles event. There was also singles and doubles events for boys and girls (players under 18), part of the Grade A category of tournaments of the junior tour. There were also events for wheelchair tennis players, they competed in two categories: Paraplegic players where men and women play in separate competitions and a category for Quadriplegics, shortened to Quads and is a mixed event. These competitions are part of the NEC tour, under the Grand Slam category. The tournament was played on Plexicushion Prestige AO hard courts, which were rated a medium-fast pace by the ITF. The tournament took place over twenty-five courts, including three showcourts: the Hisense Arena, the Margaret Court Arena and the Rod Laver Arena (the Hisense and Rod Laver Arenas have roofs which allow play to continue indoors should the roof be needed).\nPoints and prize money.\nPoint distribution.\nBelow is a series of tables for each of the competitions showing the ranking points on offer for each event.\nPrize money.\nThe 2011 Australian Open offered record prize money to both men and women of a total of A$25 million (US$24 million), up 3.8% on the total prize money from 2010. The winners of the singles titles took home A$2.2 million (US$2.1 million) with the finalists receiving A$1.1 million (US$1 million).

Below is the list of prize money given to each player in the main draw of the professional competitions; all prize money is in Australian dollars (A$); doubles prize money is distributed per pair.\nFundraising for the Queensland floods.\nFollowing widespread flooding in Queensland, several players decided to raise money for the cause.

In total, the ATP and WTA raised $51,070.\nIn Brisbane, Andy Roddick and Sam Stosur pledged a hundred dollars for every ace they hit, which was also matched by Australian player Matthew Ebden when he played in Sydney the following week. Roddick later doubled his pledge to two hundred dollars. In total, Roddick hit fifty four aces, raising just under eleven thousand dollars for his efforts during the Brisbane tournament. In addition to this, the Brisbane International donated another five thousand dollars.\nAmerican player Bethanie Mattek-Sands pledged to donate five percent of her prize money from the Hobart International and Australian Open to the cause. The ITF donated $25,000 towards the rebuilding of tennis facilities.\nRally for Relief.\nOn 16 January, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Kim Clijsters, Novak Djokovic, Lleyton Hewitt, Andy Murray, Andy Roddick, Justine Henin, Ana Ivanovic, Victoria Azarenka, Vera Zvonareva, Caroline Wozniacki and Queenslanders Sam Stosur and Pat Rafter played a charity match at Rod Laver Arena to raise money for the flood efforts.

This would not be the Grand Slam, but the media had dubbed the feat if Nadal was to achieve it the \"Rafa Slam\", which was taken from the \"Serena Slam\" which was coined when Serena Williams won all four Grand Slam titles in a row spanning two calendar years, which in turn was taken from the \"Tiger Slam\" in which golfer Tiger Woods accomplished a similar feat in golf.\nNadal was the number one seed and led the field. The other top ten seeds were; defending Australian Open champion and sixteen time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer, 2008 Australian Open winner Novak Djokovic, two time Grand Slam finalists Robin Söderling and Andy Murray, Wimbledon runner up Tomáš Berdych, David Ferrer, 2003 US Open champion Andy Roddick, Fernando Verdasco and Mikhail Youzhny.\nThe start of the 2011 Australian Open saw all the seeds apart from Gulbis, Querrey, who lost in the fifth set 8–6 and Davydenko make it to the second round.

There were also wins for Berdych, Djokovic, Federer, Murray and Nadal, all except Federer eliminated other seeds. There was one other upset as nineteenth seed Wawrinka beat Roddick in straight sets.\nDjokovic, Federer and Murray successfully made their way into the semifinals, however the upset of the tournament happened as Nadal went out.

At 8–7 in the final set Kutznetsova had three match points, but the Italian saved all three.

        "text": " \nSomerset County Cricket Club is one of the 18 member clubs of the English County Championship, representing the historic county of Somerset. The club was established in August 1875 and has played first-class cricket since 1882, List A cricket since 1963, and Twenty20 cricket since 2003. Unlike most professional sports, in which a team usually has a single fixed home ground, county cricket clubs have traditionally used different grounds in various towns and cities within the county for home matches, although the use of minor \"out grounds\" has diminished since the 1980s. Somerset have played first class, List A, or Twenty20 matches at eighteen different grounds.\nSomerset's first home first-class match was against Hampshire in 1882 at the County Ground, Taunton. This ground is the headquarters of the county club, and has hosted more Somerset matches than any other ground. It was originally known as the Taunton Athletic Ground, and featured a cycling/running track around the outside of the playing area which was later removed. Prior to the cessation of cricket during the First World War, Somerset only played at three other grounds; two in Bath, and Clarence Park in Weston-super-Mare. The Recreation Ground in Bath, the home ground of Bath Rugby, has been a regular setting for Somerset, hosting over 300 county matches. It is also Somerset's only venue other than the County Ground to have hosted a Twenty20 match. Clarence Park also frequently hosted Somerset matches until 1996, and has featured over 200 Somerset games. The next most frequently used ground is Morlands Athletic Ground in Glastonbury, where Somerset played 24 times between 1952 and 1978.\nAfter the First World War, Somerset began playing in a wider variety of locations around the county, including three different grounds in Yeovil, and also hosted five matches at the Recreation Ground in Torquay, despite that being in Devon. They played in three different grounds in Bristol, which has been considered an independent county since 1373, though it was part of the county of Avon from 1974 until 1996, and where Gloucestershire County Cricket Club have their headquarters. After 1979, Somerset only played at the County Ground, the Recreation Ground and Clarence Park until 2012, when they faced Cardiff MCC University at Taunton Vale, their first new ground in 37 years. Somerset have not played a county match outside of Taunton since 2011, when they faced Essex in a Twenty20 match in Bath.\nGrounds.\n\"Below is a complete list of grounds used by Somerset County Cricket Club for first-class, List A and Twenty20 matches. Statistics are complete through to the end of the 2023 season. Only matches played by Somerset at the grounds are recorded in the table. Matches abandoned without any play occurring are not included.\""

        "text": "Michael Lombardi (born June 19, 1959) is an American football executive and media analyst. Until 2016, he was an assistant to the coaching staff of the New England Patriots and is a former analyst for the NFL Network and sportswriter at NFL.com. Lombardi also previously served as an NFL executive with the San Francisco 49ers, Cleveland Browns, Philadelphia Eagles, Denver Broncos, and Oakland Raiders. He hosts his own podcast \"The GM Shuffle\" formerly with Adnan Virk now with Femi Abebefe, and co-hosts a Saturday morning sports betting program on Sirius XM for Vegas Stats &amp; Information Network along with a daily show on Vegas Stats &amp; Information Network called \"The Lombardi Line\".\nLife and career.\nEarly life.\nLombardi grew up in Ocean City, New Jersey and played both baseball and football at Valley Forge Military Academy. He attended Hofstra University from 1977–1981, where he played defensive lineman and long snapper for the football team.\nEarly career.\nIn 1981, Lombardi was hired as a recruiting coordinator at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas by Rebels' head coach Harvey Hyde.\nNational Football League.\nLombardi began his NFL career in 1984 as an area scout under Bill Walsh of the San Francisco 49ers, where he stayed until 1987. He is credited for the initial discovery and scouting of Hall of Famer Charles Haley, who was drafted by San Francisco 49ers in 1986 NFL Draft.\nLombardi joined the Cleveland Browns organization as pro personnel director in 1987. Later, he became the Browns' director of player personnel and worked under head coach Bill Belichick managing drafts, negotiating contracts and acquiring free agents.\nIn 1997, Philadelphia Eagles President Joe Banner hired Lombardi as a consultant to assist with the 1997 NFL Draft. Banner then named Lombardi director of pro personnel of the Eagles in 1998.\nLater that same year, Al Davis hired Lombardi to serve as senior personnel executive of the Oakland Raiders, a position which he held until 2007. During his tenure with the Raiders, Oakland won three consecutive AFC West titles and advanced to Super Bowl XXXVII.\nIn October 2012, sportswriter Jason La Canfora reported that the Cleveland Browns were considering Lombardi for their vacancy at general manager. He was hired for that position five months later. On February 11, 2014, the Browns replaced Lombardi with Ray Farmer.\n2014 through 2016, Lombardi worked under Bill Belichick of the New England Patriots as an assistant to the coaching staff. Speaking about Lombardi's time in New England, Belichick said, \"Mike's...one of the smartest people I've worked with. He was huge asset to me for the two years he was here...he studies football and he knows it very well.\"\nLombardi has worked as an administrator in the NFL for over 30 years and has worked for Bill Walsh, Al Davis and Bill Belichick. Sports and pop culture essayist Chuck Klosterman described Lombardi as, \"a detail freak and a polymath, or at least a person successfully attempting to impersonate one\" after spending time with him at the Cleveland Browns facility in the hours leading up to the 2013 NFL Draft. Lombardi has also been described as, \"one of the most quiet but influential executives in the NFL.\" He has been credited as one of the first NFL executives to study the science of scouting players for moral character.\nBroadcasting.\nAs a broadcaster, Lombardi has worked for ESPN, CBS Sports, Showtime, the NFL Network and Fox Sports. He began his career as a member of the media in 1996 when he spent part of that year as an NFL draft analyst for ESPN. He also spent portions of 1998 and 1999 as an editorial consultant and studio analyst for CBS Sports as on-air talent for the \"NFL Today\" pre-game show.\nIn 2008, Lombardi joined NFL Films' \"Inside the NFL\", a weekly Showtime series where he provided analysis alongside host James Brown and former NFL players Cris Collinsworth, Phil Simms and Warren Sapp. That same year, Lombardi began contributing to several NFL Network shows, including as an in-studio analyst and reporting live from individual games.\nLombardi was hired by Fox Sports in September 2016. When he joined Fox, national networks president Jamie Horowitz said in a statement, \"Michael is a thought-provoking and insightful football analyst with an impressive résumé. We feel like his blunt approach and original perspective makes the FS1 shows more interesting, and the fans of those shows more informed.\"\nDigital media.\nIn 2010, after working as on-air talent at the NFL Network for two years, Lombardi began writing columns for NFL.com, duties he performed until 2012. Lombardi has also contributed writing to \"Sports Illustrated\" and the \"National Football Post\", the latter of which he founded and served as editor-in-chief for three years. In January 2017, Lombardi took a position with The Ringer where he hosted the \"GM Street\" podcast with Tate Frazier and also wrote articles on occasion for the website. He announced via Twitter in March 2019 that he had left The Ringer to work on his own podcast. He currently hosts The GM Shuffle podcast with Femi Abebefe and co-hosts a program for Vegas Stats &amp; Information Network.\nIn September 2017, Mike Lombardi made headlines by criticizing Philadelphia Eagles coach Doug Pederson: \"He might be less qualified to coach a team than anyone I’ve ever seen in my 30-plus years in the NFL.\" Pederson would lead the Eagles to their first Super Bowl championship later that season.\nIn 2020, Lombardi became a co-host on \"Hammer Dahn\", a gambling podcast from Pat McAfee Inc.\nWriting.\nLombardi has written two books. \"Gridiron Genius: A Master Class in Winning Championships and Building Dynasties in the NFL\" was published in September 2018.\nHis second book was published in September 2023 and is called \"Football Done Right: Setting the Record Straight on the Coaches, Players, and History of the NFL.\"\nPersonal life.\nLombardi is not related to Green Bay Packers coaching legend Vince Lombardi. He is an avid reader with an interest in Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon B. Johnson. He and his wife, Millie, have two sons: Matt, who was the assistant wide receivers coach for the Las Vegas Raiders; and Mick, who was the offensive coordinator for the Las Vegas Raiders from the 2022 season until Week 8 of the 2023 NFL season."

        "text": "At the 2010 South Asian Games, the athletics events were held at the Bangabandhu National Stadium in Dhaka, Bangladesh from February 6 to February 9. A total of 23 events were contested, of which 15 by male and 8 by female athletes.\nIndia (10 golds) had the greatest medal haul of the six countries which reached the medal table, shortly followed by Sri Lanka (8 golds). Stand out performers included Chandrika Subashini, who took the 200/400 metres double, and Pakistan's Naseem Hameed, who was a rank outsider before the games but won the women's 100 metres race over more-fancied opposition. Following her victory, the Senate of Pakistan passed a resolution to improve her family's poor living standards and reward her with professional training.\nThe marathon race caused much controversy as Rajendra Bahadur Bhandari, returning from a doping violation from the 2006 South Asian Games, finished in first place. Furthermore, a miscalculation caused by a change in finishing location resulted in a course of only 35 km (over 5 km short of the true marathon distance). Following an investigation, the athletes' positions remained unchanged, although their times were barred from the record books."

        "text": "The Ohio State Buckeyes women's ice hockey team represents Ohio State University in NCAA Division I competition in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) conference. The team plays in Columbus, Ohio at The Ohio State Ice Rink, located on the Ohio State campus.\nHistory.\nThe Buckeyes competed in the WCHA championship tournament in March 2001, defeating the St. Cloud State Huskies in the first round and No. 1 Minnesota Golden Gophers in the second round to advance to the championship game. The Buckeyes were defeated by eventual national champion Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs. The Buckeyes had an 18–16–3 overall record, including 11–10–3 in the WCHA, and finished No. 8 in the national polls. During the regular season, they were 12–5–1 in their last 18 contests and finished 7–1–0.\nThe 2001–02 season saw the Buckeyes defeat several nationally ranked teams, including the No. 3 University of New Hampshire Wildcats and the No. 4 St. Lawrence Saints, and tie the No. 6 Dartmouth Big Green. Five players received postseason honors, including Jeni Creary, who was named the WCHA Rookie of the Year and All-WCHA First Team selection after leading the nation in scoring for the first half of the season, and Emma Terho , who earned JOFA/AHCA Second Team All-America accolades and All-WCHA Second Team honors despite missing ten games while representing her native Finland at the 2002 Winter Olympics.\nIn the 2006–07 season, the Buckeyes reached the 20-win mark for the first time in program history, finishing the season with a 20–13–4 record. They set a program record for the longest unbeaten streak at ten games (9–0–1, Oct. 28 – Dec. 8), posted a team-best 30 points in the WCHA with a 13–11–4 conference record and had a 12–5–3 home record while finishing fourth in the league standings. They swept the Minnesota State Mavericks in the best-of-three league playoff tournament and advanced to the WCHA semifinals against eventual national champion Wisconsin. The Buckeyes completed the season as the 10th-ranked team in both the USCHO.com and USA Hockey national polls.\nHead coach Jackie Barto recorded her 200th career win November 24, 2007 with a 4–1 victory against St. Cloud State at the OSU Ice Rink.\nIn 2008, Tessa Bonhomme was Ohio State's first two-time Top 10 finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award, given to the top Division I women's hockey student-athlete in the nation. She was also the team captain of the 2007–08 Buckeyes. Bonhomme was also named WCHA Player of the Year and WCHA Defensive Player of the Year, the first Buckeye to receive either award.\nJody Heywood was a two-time finalist for the Hockey Humanitarian Award in 2007 and 2008, the first Buckeye on either men's or women's teams to be a finalist for the award.\nIn 2009, Liana Bonanno became the program's first ESPN The Magazine Academic All-America at-large selection, earning a place on the third team.\nNatalie Spooner scored 21 goals in 2009, leading the team and earning the program's No. 7 spot for single-season goals. She had a six-game point streak from Nov. 15 to Jan. 9 that included a five-game goal streak to tie for the second-longest in program history. On December 12, 2008, she set the program record for goals in a game with four in a 6–5 win at Minnesota State, including a natural hat trick in the second period in a span of 1:56.\nThe opening game of the 2009–10 season was Barto's 500th career game as coach.\nLaura McIntosh was recognized as the WCHA offensive player of the week for October 19, 2011. She had a record-breaking weekend in the Buckeyes' conference series sweep of St. Cloud State, during which she was credited with four points, seven shots on goal and a +5 plus/minus rating. On October 14, she scored her first goal of the season and assisted on a Hokey Langan goal. The assist made McIntosh Ohio State's all-time leader in career points against WCHA opponents, surpassing Jana Harrigan's 110 league points in 2006. The following day, McIntosh scored two points, assisting on Ally Tarr's shorthanded game-winning goal and scoring the Buckeyes' third goal of the game.\nThree players reached milestones in a January 27, 2012 defeat of the North Dakota Fighting Sioux. Spooner scored two goals, McIntosh had three assists and Langan had two assists. McIntosh's assists moved her into a tie at the top of the program's all-time career points list. Her 160 career points are now tied with Harrigan's. Spooner's goals were both on the power-play, bringing her season total to seven. With the goals, Spooner reached the 150 career point mark, good for third all-time in program history. Langan's assists helped her reach the 100-point milestone, only the eighth Buckeyes player to reach the mark.\nThe Buckeyes suffered a period of coaching instability, having three head coaches in three seasons. Nate Handrahan resigned in 2015 following reports of sexual harassment, and replacement coach Jenny Schmidgall-Potter resigned in 2016 after repeated NCAA violations. Ohio State Athletic Director Gene Smith hired then-Minnesota Assistant Coach Nadine Muzerall. Muzerall was an Assistant Coach at Minnesota from 2011–2016, which won four national championships in that span. Prior to Muzerall's hiring, the team had never qualified for the NCAA tournament. \nMuzerall quickly turned the Buckeyes around. Following a 14-18-5 season in 2017, they received an at large bid for the 2018 NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Tournament. They beat the Boston College Eagles 2–0 in the quarterfinals, making it to their first ever NCAA Women's Frozen Four. They lost in the semi-finals to Clarkson.\nOn March 8, 2020, the Buckeyes defeated the Wisconsin Badgers 1–0 in overtime to earn the program's first WCHA championship. They automatically qualified for the 2020 NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Tournament, but it was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. They received an at large bid for the 2021 NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Tournament.\nFor the 2020/21 season the Buckeyes once again advanced to the WCHA Championship game, where they fell to the Wisconsin Badgers in overtime. In the National Tournament, they beat Boston College in the quarterfinals 3-1 but once again fell to Wisconsin in the Frozen Four\nDuring the 2021/22 season, the Buckeyes reached the program's first 1 seed after defeating Minnesota 3–2 in overtime for the WCHA Championship, in the process earning both an automatic bid to the 2022 NCAA Women'sIceHockeyTournament and a home playoff game. The Buckeyes defeated the 7 seed Quinnipiac 4–3 in double overtime, sending them the program's 3rd Frozen Four. There, they beat #6 Yale 2–1, and won the program's first National Title two days later, beating Minnesota Duluth 3–2. Defenseman Sophie Jaques finished the season with 21 goals and 38 assists for 59 points total and was a Patty Kazmaier Award finalist. Jaques and head coach Nadine Muzerall became the USCHO's Player of the Year and Coach of the Year, respectively.\nIn the 2022/23 season, the Buckeyes won their first WCHA regular season title on the back of a 28-4-2 regular season record. They lost to Minnesota in the WCHA Championship game but still received the #1 overall seed in the NCAA tournament, their second in a row. In the NCAA tournament, the Buckeyes beat Quinnipiac 5-2 in the quarterfinal and played in their third-straight Women's Frozen Four against #5 seed Northeastern, who they beat 3-0 to advance to their second-straight final. In the final, Ohio State lost 1-0 to Wisconsin, giving Wisconsin their 7th title. Sophie Jaques won the Patty Kazmaier Award, given annually to the best player in Women's Hockey. She was Ohio State's first player to win that award and just the second defenseman to win the award.\nCoaches.\nBarto served as the program's first head coach, leading the team from 1999 to 2011 and finishing with a record of 178–209–42 (.464). During her first ten years as head coach, the program received 14 All-WCHA honors. She served on the NCAA Women's Ice Hockey Championship Committee from 2000 to 2006 and is a member of the American Women's Hockey Coaches Association. She retired in April 2011 after 12 seasons at Ohio State.\nIn May 2011, Nate Handrahan became the program's second head coach. He coached the team for four seasons, finishing with a record of 67–64–15 (.507). He resigned on March 9, 2015, amid a sexual harassment investigation.\nOn April 12, 2015, Jenny Schmidgall-Potter was named the program's third head coach. She finished her single season with a record of 10–25–1 (.288).\nIn September 2016, Nadine Muzerall was named the program's fourth head coach.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nInternational.\nOn the international level, Barto was an assistant coach in 1998 at the USA Hockey Women's Festival in Lake Placid, N.Y., where she was one of four head coaches in 1999. She was an assistant coach for the 2003 U.S. Women's Under-22 Select Team. She was a member of the selection committee for the 2006 Winter Olympic U.S. National Women's Hockey team.

She was named head coach of the U.S. Women's Under-22 Team for 2008–09. She led the U.S. Women's National Team to the gold medal at the 2008 IIHF World Women's Championship in Harbin, China.\nSpooner was a member of the Canadian National Women's Team for the 2008 4 Nations Cup. She competed for the 2009-10 Canada Under 22 Hockey team. On January 8, 2010, she scored 4:59 in overtime to give Canada's National Women's Under-22 Team a 4–3 victory over Sweden and send Canada to the gold medal game at the 2010 MLP Cup, where Canada won the gold medal."

        "text": " \nWomen's ice hockey tournaments have been staged at the Olympic Games since 1998. The United States women's national ice hockey team has participated in every tournament since then. Ten goaltenders and sixty-seven skaters have played for the United States.\nMen's ice hockey was introduced at the 1920 Summer Olympics and added to the Winter Olympic Games in 1924. In July 1992, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to approve women's hockey as an Olympic event to first be held at the 1998 Winter Olympics. Until 1998, international women's hockey had been dominated by Canada's national team. Canadian teams had won every World Championship; however, by 1997, the American team had improved and was evenly matched with Canada. In thirteen games played between the two teams in 1997, Canada won seven and the United States six. Canada and the United States dominated the preliminary round of the 1998 tournament, and in their head-to-head match up during the final round-robin game, the United States won 7–4. The two teams met again in the gold medal game, which the United States won 3–1. \nThe Canadian and American teams have established a strong rivalry since the 1998 Winter Games, playing each other in the gold medal game in all but one instance. In a rematch between the two at the 2002 Winter Olympics, Canada won 3–2. In the 2006 Olympics, the American team advanced to the semi-finals before falling to Sweden. It marked the first time in international competition that the final would not feature the United States against Canada. The Americans defeated Finland for the bronze medal. The 2010 US team included fifteen players making their Olympic debut. The Americans again met the Canadians in the final, and a repeat of 2002, the Canadians took the gold, giving the Americans their second silver. The Canadians again won gold in Sochi at the 2014 Winter Olympics, in a 3-2 overtime win against the US team. In 2018, at the Olympic Winter Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea, the US defeated Canada in the gold medal game, winning in a shoot-out. In the 2022 Winter Olympic games in Beijing, the US lost the gold medal game to Canada, by a score of 3-2.\nThe United States has won two gold medals, three silver medals, and one bronze medal in women's hockey at the Winter Games. One player (Cammi Granato) has been inducted into the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) Hall of Fame and the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. In addition, the 1998 gold medal-winning team was inducted into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame. Two women (Angela Ruggiero and Jenny Potter) have participated in four tournaments and won four medals (one gold, two silvers, and one bronze). Potter is the all-time leading American scorer in the women's tournament at the Olympics, with 11 goals, 19 assists and 30 points. National teams are coordinated by USA Hockey and players are chosen by the team's management staff.\nReferences.\nGeneral\nSpecific"

        "text": "The 2007 Giro d'Italia began on 12 May, with Stage 11 occurring on 23 May. The route began in Caprera in Sardinia, with the first three stages being held on the island. These were followed by an unusually early rest day to transfer to Italy's mainland.\nThe first stage was a team time trial, a stage where each member of the team raced together against the clock. The Italian team won this stage, but it was sprinter Enrico Gasparotto and not team leader Danilo Di Luca who was the first across the line and thus the first wearer of the pink jersey. Gasparotto and Di Luca traded the jersey back and forth over the next few days' flat stages.\nStage 6 featured a winning breakaway, and it accounted for the only time in the 2007 Giro when the Liquigas team did not hold the race leadership. Marco Pinotti and Luis Felipe Laverde were the last riders remaining from that day's morning escape, claiming the pink jersey and the stage win, respectively. Pinotti held the race leadership through the flat stages that followed, before yielding it to the Giro's oldest rider, Di Luca's Liquigas teammate Andrea Noè.\nItalian sprinter Alessandro Petacchi of won three of the first eleven stages of this Giro, but his subsequent disqualification for a non-negative salbutamol test after stage 11 nullified these victories.\nStage 1.\n12 May 2007 — Caprera to La Maddalena, (team time trial)\nThis was the Giro's first visit to Sardinia since 1991. The course for the team time trial was technical, with many twists and turns in the road. It took the squads from Caprera on the island of Sardinia across a bridge to the tiny Maddalena island to the northwest. Favorites for the stage included , , and .\nThe early time to beat was set by , the second team to take the course. They stopped the clock in 35'06\". was well on pace to knock them off, but a crash from the finish line dashed any hopes of theirs for a stage win. Their fifth rider didn't cross the line until a minute after their first four had, and they finished 21st, better than only . was the first team under 35 minutes, clocking in at 34'08\", which would eventually be good for third on the day. Paolo Savoldelli's team finished with only the minimum of five riders together, but their 33'51\" was nearly good enough for the stage win. The winning team was , coming home with six riders in 33'38\". The big surprise of the day was that the first Liquigas rider across the line was not their team leader Danilo Di Luca, but rather sprinter Enrico Gasparotto. Di Luca was visibly upset to have not been granted first position as the squad approached the finish line. Though Gasparotto at first claimed it was the team's plan for him and not Di Luca to cross first, he later admitted that he had momentarily forgotten that the team's time was taken for the fifth rider across the line and not the first, explaining that he was simply excited to finish as quickly as possible once the finish line was in view. Along with the pink jersey, Gasparotto was awarded the white jersey for leading the youth classification; his teammate Vincenzo Nibali wore that jersey in stage 2.\nStage 2.\n13 May 2007 — Tempio Pausania to Bosa, \nBack on Sardinia, the first road race stage of the Giro was flat, heading west from Tempio Pausania along the Gulf of Asinara before going to the south and over the second-category Villanova Monteleone climb, which awarded the first green jersey. A sprint finish was the expectation.\nFive riders broke free of the peloton after of racing. These were Frédéric Bessy, Mauro Facci, Simone Masciarelli, Pavel Brutt and Arnaud Labbe. They worked well together, attaining a six-minute advantage by pounding out a pace after two hours. set to making the chase, being joined briefly by . The time gap fell precipitously, despite Brutt's best effort to pace the breakaway. Brutt was the first over the Villanova Monteleone climb, and took the first green jersey on the podium after the stage. As the stage neared its conclusion, the teams of the primary sprinters joined in the chase. Brutt was the last rider left off the front. His solo attempt lasted until the to go mark, when the peloton was all together. , and came to the front in the final to try to set up the sprint for Alessandro Petacchi, Damiano Cunego and race leader Enrico Gasparotto, but with to go, 's Andrea Tonti crashed and brought down much of the main field with him. Gasparotto was among the riders to crash. Since the crash took place inside to the finish line, all riders who fell were given the same time as the stage winner.\n's fast man Robbie McEwen was 15 or 20 riders deep in the bunch during the descent from the small bump in the road that preceded the finish. He managed to find Petacchi's wheel, and held it while his team Milram executed a leadout in the stage's final kilometer. The veteran Aussie came around Petacchi for the stage win, holding off Paolo Bettini, who had done the same. As Gasparotto finished 43rd on the stage and his team leader Danilo Di Luca 12th, Di Luca took the pink jersey for stage 3, though all the Liquigas riders who finished together in the team time trial were still tied in the overall standings at this point.\nStage 3.\n14 May 2007 — Barumini to Cagliari, \nThe third stage was also flat, starting in the south-central of Sardinia. It did not have any categorized climbs. It ended in Cagliari, with the last on rough, uneven terrain. After this stage, the Giro took an uncommonly early rest day to transfer to Italy's mainland.\nRight away, a five-man breakaway formed, instigated by Mikhail Ignatiev and Elio Aggiano. Their eventual mates were Mickaël Buffaz, Alexandre Pichot, and Giovanni Visconti. Their maximum advantage was 7'40\", as the leading team did not mount a strong chase for much of the stage. Ignatiev and Visconti attacked at the to go mark, and the other three were left behind, quickly reabsorbed by the peloton. When the peloton realized that the breakaway had split, the teams of the sprinters, namely and , set to making the chase in earnest in order to be able to ensure a mass finish. Ignatiev and Visconti were caught with remaining after bravely fighting on as long as possible. Other inconsequential breakaway attempts took place in the next few minutes, but the group was all one for a mass finish, won by Alessandro Petacchi, though this was one of his many 2007 wins that was later stripped due to his irregular salbutamol test later in the race. Since Enrico Gasparotto contested the sprint and finished 74 places ahead of teammate and overnight race leader Danilo Di Luca, Gasparotto reclaimed the pink jersey while still holding the white. Nibali again wore the white jersey in his stead in the following stage.\nStage 4.\n16 May 2007 — Salerno to Montevergine di Mercogliano, \nAfter the transfer to the Italian mainland, the peloton faced a medium mountain stage that concluded with the first-category climb to Montevergine di Mercogliano. The finish was highly technical, with over a dozen switchbacks.\nWith covered, 's Yuriy Krivtsov instigated the day's breakaway, being joined by mountains classification leader Pavel Brutt, who was looking to add to his lead in that standing. 's Markel Irizar joined them later. While Brutt did get maximum points on the third-category Picco San Angelo climb, the route prior to the Montevergine di Mercogliano climb was mostly flat, and the -paced main field caught the trio shortly after the climb began. Julio Alberto Pérez attacked for the stage win with left, and nearly held on to the finish line. With left, a group of nine passed up Pérez and contested the stage finish among themselves. Danilo Di Luca took off for the line with remaining to race. He had Riccardo Riccò and Damiano Cunego on his wheel, but neither came around him in the sprint, affording the leader the stage win and, for the second time, the pink jersey. Di Luca had previously won a stage that ended on this climb in the 2001 Giro d'Italia. Being first on the category-one climb also gave Di Luca the green jersey; second-place man Riccò wore that jersey in the next two stages.\nStage 5.\n17 May 2007 — Teano to Frascati, \nStage five was mostly flat, but a third-category climb from the finish line had the potential to break up the field. The descent into the wine country town of Frascati was technical, covering twisting, turning roads to the finish line.\n rider Mikhail Ignatiev was the day's first escapee. Mickaël Buffaz joined him after , and the two quickly attained a five-minute advantage. paced the main field for race leader Danilo Di Luca, and in the third hour of racing they tapped out a pace, cutting significantly into the breakaway's time gap. When Ignatiev realized that the main field was closing in on them, he attacked and came free of Buffaz, trying to solo to the finish line, but he was caught from the finish line. František Raboň, Matt White, Salvatore Commesso, and Elia Aggiano tried their luck within the final , but none stayed away for more than a few minutes, and the widely expected mass sprint took place. 's Angelo Furlan tried to execute a leadout for Thor Hushovd, but Alessandro Petacchi's train from overran him. A chaotic sprint followed, with several riders having victory in their view. 's Robert Förster was the first over the line for the win.\nStage 6.\n18 May 2007 — Tivoli to Spoleto, \nThis medium mountain stage had three climbs, one in each category. The first-category Monte Terminillo crested a little after the halfway point of the stage, and with two climbs in the next afterward, pre-race analysis found this to be a stage conducive to a winning breakaway.\nWildcard teams and were active in early breakaway attempts, but no riders got clear until over an hour spent racing and were covered. Daniele Contrini instigated the day's breakaway at that point, and Marco Pinotti, Christophe Kern, Hubert Schwab, and Luis Felipe Laverde joined him. The breakaway was riding cohesively through the Monte Terminillo climb, and the -led main field did not chase very hard to bring them back. Pinotti was the best-placed man in the break, 3'11\" back of race leader Danilo Di Luca on the day. The group's advantage quickly exceeded three minutes, meaning Pinotti stood to become race leader if they stayed away. Laverde took the mountains points at the top of the Terminillo, and took the green jersey on the podium at day's end.\nThe group's advantage on the descent of the Terminillo was almost eight minutes, and it continued to rise for a time after that. Kern and Contrini had trouble keeping the pace with the leading group as the stage went on, with time trial specialist Pinotti setting a very fast pace. On the day's last climb, the second-category Forca d'Acero, Pinotti and Laverde distinguished themselves as the last remnants of the break, still seven minutes clear of the main field. Kern and Schwab were 90 seconds off the pace at the finish, with Contrini 3 minutes back. As the two leaders approached the finish line, Pinotti abided by an unwritten rule in cycling as he allowed Laverde to take the stage win, knowing that he (Pinotti) was going to take the overall race leadership. Alessandro Petacchi led the peloton home 7'09\" behind Laverde.\nStage 7.\n19 May 2007 — Spoleto to Scarperia, \nThis was a long, flat stage, winding through the regions of Umbria and Tuscany. It included the third-category Valico Croce a Mori, but this climb was a good from the finish line, meaning it was unlikely to prevent a mass sprint from happening.\nAt the mark, a four-rider break formed, instigated again by a member of . This was Elio Aggiano, and he drew with him Swiss time trial specialist Rubens Bertogliati, Beñat Albizuri, and Fabien Patanchon. After , they had 11 minutes on the main field. It was at this point that the teams of the sprinters set to making the chase. The time gap fell precipitously, and when Bertogliati topped Valico Croce a Mori in first position, the peloton was only one minute behind. and in particular their leader, reigning world champion Paolo Bettini, had made an aggressive chase on the ascent to try to soften the field. With left to race, the break was brought back into the main field. Matt White, Salvatore Commesso, and Fabian Cancellara tried to break away and solo to the finish line, but all were brought back. The leadout train again delivered Alessandro Petacchi to the line first, though this was one of his many 2007 wins that was later stripped due to his irregular salbutamol test later in the race.\nStage 8.\n20 May 2007 — Barberino di Mugello to Fiorano Modenese, \nThis stage had two distinct halves. The first was hilly, with two categorized climbs and several uncategorized rises in elevation. After descending from the third-category Sestola climb, the peloton took in a flat second half of the stage en route to Fiorano Modenese. Once there, the stage concluded with a lap on the Fiorano Circuit, the private test track for Ferrari sports cars. The stage commemorated 60 years since the introduction of the first Ferrari.\nAt the mark, rider Dario Cioni broke away, and instigated a big chase pack to come after him. Twenty-seven riders formed the day's principal break. The best-placed man in the group was ' Andrea Noè, who was 4' 47\" back at the beginning of the day, meaning his position threatened that of race leader Marco Pinotti. The presence of Riccardo Riccò in the group meant that the peloton was likely to chase it down, as Riccò was an outside favorite for overall victory in the Giro. The other riders in the group repeatedly attacked to try to shed Riccò, and when his sporting director instructed him to drop back, Riccò rejoined the peloton. Five other riders also dropped back, leaving 21 out front. They worked cohesively to gain an advantage of seven minutes on the main field, keeping it at that gap for most of the stage. Pinotti's set to making the chase, but no other team helped, as they were the only team who had a vested interest in limiting the escape group's time gap. One team pulling the peloton was no match for 21 riders working together, and it quickly became clear that the breakaway would not be caught. They managed to pull back three minutes by the time the riders reached the Ferrari race track, meaning Pinotti was narrowly able to retain the pink jersey. Various members of the 21-strong leading group tried to attack for the stage win, with ' Pavel Brutt away within the final kilometer, only to be overhauled by Emanuele Sella. Sella was in turn passed by world champion Paolo Bettini, but 's Kurt Asle Arvesen had ably held Bettini's wheel in the final kilometer and started his sprint at just the right time to win the stage. Pinotti's lead was reduced to under 30 seconds; he thanked teammates Lorenzo Bernucci, Axel Merckx and Aaron Olson for their hard pace-setting at the front of the peloton, but also noted that the team would need to ride better on subsequent days if they were to continue to keep the jersey.\nStage 9.\n21 May 2007 — Reggio Emilia to Lido di Camaiore, \nAfter the second-category Passo del Cerreto, the course descended almost all the way to sea level and was flat to the finish. The finish was in Camaiore on the Ligurian coast, in the Italian Riviera.\nThe peloton took it easy for most of this stage. Their pace through two hours of racing was a paltry . There was no significant breakaway in this time. Only the Passo del Cerreto climb spurred any combativity in the riders, as six, including mountains classification leader Luis Felipe Laverde broke away on the ascent. Four of them tried to soldier on for the stage win, but the teams of the sprinters, and the race leader's , worked well to keep the main field together. tapped out a furious pace in the final , reaching and forcing the peloton to ride single file. They continued their leadout in the last kilometer, for Alessandro Petacchi, but it was Danilo Napolitano who took the stage win. The overall standings were unchanged by the day's results.\nStage 10.\n22 May 2007 — Camiaore to Santuario Nostra Signora della Guardia, \nThis was a difficult stage, long and with a lot of climbing. Two categorized climbs on course preceded the first-category summit stage finish at Santuario Nostra Signora Della Guardia. The course headed northwest from Camaiore through the Cinque Terre on the Ligurian coast, finishing with a climb with a steady 8% grade, and stretches reaching 14%.\nIn sharp contrast to the previous stage, the peloton rode very aggressively from the outset on this stage. Numerous breakaway attempts in the first two hours got free briefly, only to be brought back minutes later. The right move at the right time turned out to be Iván Parra, George Hincapie, Alberto Losada, Mauricio Ardila, Fortunato Baliani, and Hubert Dupont forming a six-rider break at the mark. Their lead exceeded 4 minutes at times, and at those points Hincapie was the virtual race leader, having entered the day 3' 04\" behind Marco Pinotti. This advantage did not last for very long, being whittled down by the pink jersey group. The day's hot weather also took its toll on Ardila and Dupont, as they fell from the leading group and into one of the various trailing groups on the road.\nThe leaders had one minute on the Pinotti group as the ascent of the day's penultimate climb began. Hincapie flatted and was gapped between the two groups as the time gap was so small that team cars were not allowed between them. He managed to bridge back up to the remaining leaders Baliani, Parra, and Losada. Pinotti was dropped from the main chase group on this climb, finishing 36th on the stage and losing the pink jersey. The had been pacing this group when their leader Danilo Di Luca attacked, which caused all group dynamics to be abandoned. Leonardo Piepoli responded to Di Luca's move and drew Andy Schleck with him. Piepoli stayed away for the stage win after shedding Schleck moments later. Di Luca passed Schleck for second on the stage, and with that result he regained the leadership of the mountains classification. His teammate Andrea Noè, the oldest rider in the Giro, was the new race leader.\nStage 11.\n23 May 2007 — Serravalle Scrivia to Pinerolo, \nThis was a transitional stage, leaving the Ligurian coast, traveling through Langhe to end at the ancient crossroads city of Pinerolo.\nThe peloton stayed together through the first hour of racing. Mickaël Buffaz formed the day's breakaway at the mark. His maximum advantage over the main field was more than nine minutes, but he was easily caught. With left to race, and were drilling out a hard pace at the front of the main field, and absorbed Buffaz back into the peloton. The finish was contested in a classic bunched sprint, won by Alessandro Petacchi, though this was one of his many 2007 wins that was later stripped due to his irregular salbutamol levels in a test given after this stage. Wet pavement in the final meters caused Nikolay Trusov to skid out and crash, taking many other riders down with him. Among them was race leader Andrea Noè, who tumbled across the finish line on his backside, but retained the pink jersey."

Federer was the first player to win three Grand Slams in a single season since Mats Wilander in 1988.\nFederer became the first man in the Open Era to win at least three Grand Slams and the Year-End Championships. , Federer and Novak Djokovic are the only male tennis players to accomplish this, with Federer repeating the feat in 2006 and 2007 and Djokovic doing so in 2015, 2021, and 2023.\nYear summary.\nIn 2004, Federer had one of the most dominating and successful years in the open era of modern men's tennis. He won three of the four Grand Slam singles tournaments, did not lose a match to anyone ranked in the top 10, won every final he reached, and was named the ITF Tennis World Champion. His win–loss record for the year was 74–6 with 11 titles, which included three of the year's four Grand Slams and three ATP Masters Series titles.\nEarly hard court season.\nFederer entered the 2004 Australian Open as the second seed behind American Andy Roddick. In the fourth round he rallied to defeat former number one and native son Lleyton Hewitt after dropping the first set. His nemesis David Nalbandian, who had won five of their six previous meetings, awaited him in the quarterfinals. Federer managed to dispatch the Argentine in four tight sets. The semifinals proved easier as Federer crunched world no. 3 Juan Carlos Ferrero and reached his first Australian Open final. His opponent in the final was former world no. 1 and 2000 US Open champion Marat Safin. After winning the opening set in a tiebreaker Federer secured a 7–6, 6–4, 6–2 championship win. This victory delivered him his first Australian Open and his second career Grand Slam. This win also saw him supplant Roddick as the world no. 1 on 2 February 2004, a ranking he would hold for an all-time record 237 consecutive weeks until 18 August 2008.\nFederer's momentum was temporarily halted when he was defeated at the Rotterdam Open by Tim Henman.\nFederer quickly rebounded in March, when he won the Dubai Tennis Championships, defeating Marat Safin in the first round and Spanish player Feliciano López in the final.\nThe next stop on the calendar was the masters tournament in Indian Wells, California. Federer entered Indian Wells looking to claim his first masters title since 2002 Hamburg Masters. Federer had not dropped a set going into the semifinals where he played American legend Andre Agassi. Agassi won the first set, but Federer rallied to win a spot in the finals for the first time in Indian Wells. He seized the opportunity at the 2004 Pacific Life Open, defeating Tim Henman in straight sets to win the title.\n2004 also marked the year where he first met teenager and future arch-rival Rafael Nadal, who defeated Federer in their first encounter in Miami.\nClay court season.\nFederer skipped Monte Carlo and decided to begin his clay season at the Rome Masters. He was, however, upset in the second round by 2002 French Open champion Albert Costa.\nFederer next played the Hamburg Masters. He defeated former number 1 players Carlos Moyá and Lleyton Hewitt in the quarterfinals and semifinals respectively. He then defeated world number 3 Guillermo Coria in the final to claim his second title in Hamburg and end Coria's longest winning streak of 31 consecutive matches on clay.\nHe entered the French Open as top seed for the first time ever at a Grand Slam, but was defeated in the third round by former world number 1 and three-time French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten.\nGrass court season.\nFederer entered Halle as the defending champion and quickly solidified his status as the premier grass court player of his generation. He did not drop a set for the entire tournament and convincingly defeated American Mardy Fish in the final by the score of 6–0, 6–3.\nAfter his victory in the grass tuneup at Halle, Federer entered the Wimbledon Championships as the defending champion. Federer was aiming to be the first man to defend his title at Wimbledon since Pete Sampras (1999–2000). The Swiss dropped only one set as he made his way through the tournament and reached the final. He played world number 2 Andy Roddick for the championship in a thrilling four set final. Roddick came out strong with incredible serving and took the first set. The second set began with Federer racing out to a 4–0 lead, but Roddick rallied to level it at 4–4. Federer ultimately broke Roddick in the twelfth game and leveled the match at one set apiece. The pivotal third set was decided by a tiebreaker which was won by the Swiss defending champion. Federer closed out the match in four sets to win his third career Grand Slam.\nSummer hard court season.\nFederer's first tournament after Wimbledon was the Swiss Open at Gstaad. This was a clay court tournament that Federer played because it was a major tournament in his native Switzerland. He had played Gstaad every year between 1998–2003 but had never managed to emerge victorious. That changed in 2004 when Federer defeated Igor Andreev to win a tournament in Switzerland for the first time in his career.\nFederer then won the Canada Masters in Toronto where he defeated Andy Roddick in the finals 7–5, 6–3. This was his fourth Masters championship and his first in Canada.\nHis 23 match winning streak ended surprisingly in the first round of the Cincinnati Masters where Federer was upset by Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty.\nFederer entered the Athens Olympics as the top-seeded player and was considered the overwhelming favorite, but he was upset in the second round by Czech teenager and future world number 4 Tomáš Berdych. This would be the last loss Federer would suffer for the remainder of his 2004 season.\nFederer entered the 2004 US Open as the top seed looking to win his first US Open championship. Federer cruised through the first four rounds before facing Andre Agassi in the quarterfinals. His match against the two time US Open champion proved to be a thrilling five set epic. After splitting the first two sets the third set went to 5–5 before Federer broke and took a two set to one advantage. Agassi would take the fourth but Federer claimed the fifth and decisive set. In the semifinals Federer eased past former nemesis Tim Henman in straight sets. Federer won his first US Open singles title, defeating Lleyton Hewitt, 6–0, 7–6(3), 6–0, in the final. This was one of the most dominant displays in US Open history as Federer was the first player to win two bagel sets in the final since 1884.\nFall hard court season.\nFederer began his fall campaign at the Thailand Open. He survived a three set scare against local favorite Paradorn Srichaphan and faced world no. 2 Andy Roddick in the finals. He easily dispatched the American 6–4, 6–0. This was his twelfth consecutive victory in a tournament final which tied the all-time record of Björn Borg and John McEnroe. This victory marked Federer's tenth title of 2004.\nFederer skipped the Madrid Masters in order to focus on winning his hometown tournament of the Swiss Indoors in Basel for the first time. However, just before the start of Basel, Federer suffered a muscle fiber rupture in his left thigh and was forced to withdraw. This injury also kept him out of the Paris Masters.\nHe returned after six weeks out of action at the Tennis Masters Cup in Houston. Federer was honored as the top seed by having lunch with former President George H. W. Bush. He was the defending champion at the Year-End Championships and was placed during the round robin stage in the Red Group. The Red Group consisted of former no. 1 players Carlos Moyá and Lleyton Hewitt as well as reigning French Open champion Gastón Gaudio. He won all three round robin matches, taking six of seven sets, and faced Marat Safin in the semifinals. Federer won the first set, but the second set turned into a historic marathon tiebreaker. The tiebreaker was won by Federer by a score of 20–18 and lasted 27 minutes. The 38 points equalled the longest tie-break in tennis history along with Borg-Lall at 1973 Wimbledon and Ivanisevic-Nestor at 1993 US Open. Federer next faced Lleyton Hewitt in the finals for the sixth time that season and won the championship match 6–3, 6–2. This victory was his thirteenth consecutive victory in a tournament final which broke the record he had shared with Borg and McEnroe.\nSeason accomplishments.\nFederer won 11 titles in 2004, which included three Grand Slam titles, three ATP Masters titles, and the Tennis Masters Cup. He was the first player to win three Grand Slam titles in a single year since Mats Wilander in 1988. Federer's win–loss record for the 2004 season was 74–6, which was the best winning percentage of any player since Ivan Lendl was 74–6 in 1986.\nIn 2016, the ATP named this season as the best in Federer's career. During that year, Federer won 91.6% of his service games, also won 34.8% of his first-serve return points and saved 72.6% of break points against."

        "text": "Roger Federer contested two major finals in 2005, winning both at Wimbledon over Andy Roddick, 6–2, 7–6(2), 6–4, and the US Open over Andre Agassi, 6–3, 2–6, 7–6(1), 6–1. However, Federer failed to make the final at the other two majors, losing in the semifinals of the Australian Open to Marat Safin and the French Open to Rafael Nadal. Nevertheless, Federer won four Masters titles at Indian Wells, Miami, and Cincinnati on hard courts and one clay court title at Hamburg. Furthermore, Federer won two ATP 500 series events at Rotterdam and Dubai. Federer lost the year-end championships to David Nalbandian in the final.\nYear summary.\nThe season was statistically one of the most dominant in the Open Era. He won 11 singles titles which tied his 2004 season as the most in over two decades, his 81 match victories were the most since Pete Sampras in 1993, and his record of 81–4 (95.2%) remains the third best winning percentage in the Open Era behind only John McEnroe in 1984 and Jimmy Connors in 1974.\nEarly hard court season.\nAt the start of the year, Federer hired former Australian player Tony Roche to coach him on a limited basis. Federer began the year with a debut appearance at the Qatar Open where he defeated Croatian Ivan Ljubičić in the final. Federer dominated the field and for the first time in his career won a tournament without ever dropping his serve.\nFederer entered the first Grand Slam of the year on a 21-match winning streak that stretched over a five-month period. Federer swept through the first five rounds of the Australian Open without dropping a set, including a quarterfinal straight set win over Andre Agassi. He reached the semifinals in a repeat of the previous year's final, before falling to eventual winner Marat Safin, 7–5, 4–6, 7–5, 6–7(6), 7–9. Federer had held a match point at 6–5 in the fourth-set tiebreaker and rushed the net, however Safin responded with a lob; Federer rushed back to retrieve the ball and hit an aggressive between-the-legs trick shot which failed to clear the net. Safin went on to win the tiebreaker and the 80-minute fifth set.\nFederer pulled out of the first round of Davis Cup for the first time in his career and would not participate again in the World Group until 2012. Federer next entered the Rotterdam Open seeking his first title in the Netherlands after making the final in 2001. In the second round he played Swiss compatriot and future Grand Slam champion Stan Wawrinka, easily defeating the teenager in straight sets. In the final he again played Ljubicic, who pushed Federer to the limit, with the Swiss prevailing in a final-set tiebreaker.\nFederer next flew to the Middle East, where he was the two-time defending champion at the prestigious Dubai Tennis Championships. Federer and Agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost 700 feet above sea level at the world-famous seven-star luxury hotel the Burj al-Arab. Federer fought through final-set tiebreakers in his first two matches, the second of which, against former world number one Juan Carlos Ferrero, saw Federer fend off a match point. Federer went on to defeat Agassi in the semifinals and defeated a red-hot Ljubicic in a third final of the young season. This was the first tournament that Federer was able to win three times, and consequently it was also the first he was able to win three times consecutively.\nFederer continued to dominate with the commencement of the Masters series. Federer flew from one desert to another and arrived at the Indian Wells Masters in California as the defending champion. He played Ljubicic for the fourth time in five tournaments, again defeating the streaking Croat. In the finals Federer faced the number two player in the world and twice former champion Lleyton Hewitt, easily defeating the Australian in straight sets.\nFederer next arrived in the luxury island resort of Key Biscayne seeking his first victory at the Miami Open. Federer reached the finals beating top ten players Tim Henman and Andre Agassi along the way. In the championship match Federer met the player who had knocked him out of Miami the previous year, an 18-year-old Spaniard named Rafael Nadal. Nadal showed why he would become Federer's top rival over the next decade by sweeping the opening two sets. Federer responded by winning a third-set tiebreaker and going on to win the championship in a five set epic 2–6, 6–7(4), 7–6(5), 6–3, 6–1, after being down two sets to love, and two points from defeat. The victory made Federer only sixth man to complete the Indian Wells/Miami \"double\" and the first since Agassi in 2001. With this victory Federer had won 8 of the last 10 Masters tournaments he had entered.\nFederer compiled an astounding 27–1 record in the early hard court season with 5 titles.\nClay court season.\nFederer next transitioned to the clay courts of the Monte-Carlo Masters, entering the tournament for the first time since 2002. His 25-match winning streak was halted in the quarterfinals by 18 year old Frenchman Richard Gasquet who survived three match points and a final-set tiebreaker to defeat the world number one.\nFederer skipped the Rome Masters, instead taking three weeks off to treat tendonitis in his feet that had troubled him since the Australian Open.\nHe won his third Hamburg Masters clay-court title in May by defeating Gasquet without the loss of a set throughout the tournament.\nAfter his victory in Germany Federer flew to Lisbon, Portugal to attend the Laureus Awards. Federer won the prestigious award for \"World Sportsman of the Year\" and was presented with the Cartier trophy by Cuba Gooding Jr. and Martina Navratilova before a television audience estimated at 500 million.\nFederer, for the first time, entered the French Open with a chance to become only the sixth man to win the Career Grand Slam. He flew through the first five rounds without the loss of a set to reach his first semifinal in Paris. There he met Rafael Nadal who had dominated the clay courts in 2005 with titles in Costa do Sauípe, Acapulco, Monte-Carlo, Barcelona, and Rome. The match did not start until 6:20 pm local time. They split the first two sets with Nadal breaking in the last game of the third set to seize the two sets to one lead. Due to the late start time darkness began to fall in the fourth set and Federer requested for the match to be suspended until the next day. They played on in the near darkness, however, and Nadal broke in the eighth game of the set and served out the match. One positive Federer took from the match was that he now believed he had the game to someday win the clay Grand Slam. Additionally the crowds in Paris had taken a great liking to Federer's stylish and flamboyant style of play giving him enormous support and encouragement throughout the tournament; none more so than against Nadal, who the Parisian crowds had nicknamed \"l'Ogre\" for what they deemed to be his ugly and unstylish grinding manner of play.\nGrass court season.\nFederer began the grass swing with his usual warm-up tournament in Halle, Germany, where he was the two-time defending champion. After surviving a difficult first round against the Swede Robin Söderling, Federer swept past three Germans to reach the final. In the final he took revenge on the Australian Open champion Marat Safin, defeating the Russian 6–4, 6–7(6), 6–4.\nFederer entered Wimbledon as the overwhelming favorite with a 29-match winning streak on grass which spanned back to 2003. Federer glided into the semifinals where he faced world number 2 and former Wimbledon champion Lleyton Hewitt. Although they were the top two players in the world, the special grass seedings of Wimbledon elevated Andy Roddick as the second seed over Hewitt. This created the strange and rare circumstance of the world's top 2 players meeting before a tournament final. Federer defeated Hewitt in straight sets and advanced to the final where Andy Roddick awaited a rematch of the previous year's final. For a third consecutive year Federer defeated Roddick at the All-England Club and notched his third consecutive Wimbledon crown with a clear 6–2, 7–6(2), 6–4 victory. This marked Federer's fifth Grand Slam championship and remarkably his first of the season. He also became only the third man in the Open Era to win three consecutive Wimbledon Championships along with Björn Borg (1976–78) and Pete Sampras (1993–95 and 1997–99).\nSummer hard court season.\nUpon doctors orders Federer was forced to skip the Canadian Open because of lingering foot issues, instead focusing on recovery for the American hard court summer.\nAfter a six-week hiatus Federer returned to the Cincinnati Masters seeking his first title on the lightning quick courts of the American midwest. Strangely, Federer had only won a single match in his four previous appearances at the tournament. Federer was able to navigate his way to the finals where he faced a familiar foe in Andy Roddick, defeating the American in straight sets. This victory was historic as Federer became the first player in ATP history to win four masters titles in a single season. He also was able to sweep all three of the American Masters tournaments for the first time in his career, with victories in Indian Wells, Miami, and Cincinnati.\nFederer arrived in New York and once again found himself in another Grand Slam semifinal. By making the semifinals of all four Grand Slams that year he became only the fourth man to accomplish the feat in the Open Era along with Rod Laver, Ivan Lendl and his coach Tony Roche. He dismissed Hewitt once again in the semifinals, this time in four sets. In the finals he faced American legend and 8 time Grand Slam champion Andre Agassi. Federer stated prior to the final that playing Agassi in New York in the finals of the US Open would be \"the highlight of my career.\" Celebrities such as Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman, Lance Armstrong and Donald Trump flocked to Arthur Ashe Stadium to witness a historic generation clash of tennis superstars. The final was played on the fourth anniversary of 9/11 and patriotic fervor was in the air; it would be one of the last matches in Federer's career where the New York crowd would be pulling for his opponent. They split the first two sets, and Agassi led 4–2 in the third set before Federer leveled and the match went to a pivotal third-set tiebreaker. Federer elevated his game and won the final six points of the set to capture the tiebreaker 7–1. Federer then rolled through the fourth set to capture his second championship at the US Open. Agassi praised Federer after match, saying \"Pete (Sampras) was great, no question, but there was a place to get to with Pete. It could be on your terms. There's no such place with Roger. I think he's the best I've played against.\" With his 6th Grand Slam championship, Federer equaled his childhood idols Stefan Edberg and Boris Becker. He became only the third man to win both Wimbledon and the US Open for two consecutive years, along with Bill Tilden (1920–21) and Don Budge (1937–38). He also became the first man in 72 years to win his first six Grand Slam finals. Federer appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman who asked him the question many were beginning to wonder: was Sampras' all-time record of 14 Grand Slams, set only three years before, starting to look approachable?\nFall indoor season.\nFederer immediately flew back to Geneva in order to play the Davis Cup playoffs and keep Switzerland in the World Group. Switzerland easily crushed Great Britain to remain in the World Group for the twelfth consecutive year.\nFederer then traveled to Bangkok for the Thailand Open, where he was the defending champion. In the finals he defeated Scottish teenager and future rival Andy Murray in straight sets. Federer extended his incredible record of 24 consecutive victories in tournament finals, a streak dating back to October 2003. This victory clinched the year-end No. 1 ranking which made him only the fifth man to spend every week of a calendar season as the world No. 1.\nWhile training in Switzerland in preparation for his home tournament the Swiss Indoors Basel among others, Federer once again suffered a significant injury which hampered his fall season. During a training session he severely injured his ankle, falling to the ground and needing to be helped off the court. He was diagnosed with torn ligaments in his ankle, which forced him to withdraw from Madrid, Basel, and Paris. This injury would prove to be the most significant injury of his young career, and his status for the remainder of the year was doubtful.\nFederer was in a cast and crutches for several weeks and underwent an ultrasound and lymph drainage in order to be fit to compete for the Year-End Championships, where he was the two-time defending champion. Federer traveled to Shanghai but was unsure if he would be able to play even two days before the start of the tournament. The tournament appeared to be in shambles as many of the top eight including Marat Safin, Andy Roddick, Rafael Nadal, and Andre Agassi had already withdrawn with various injuries, and Lleyton Hewitt chose not to compete in order to spend time with his wife and his newborn child. A hobbled Federer struggled throughout all three of his round robin matches but was able to make the semifinals. In the semifinals he faced Gastón Gaudio, the 2004 French Open champion, and delivered an inexplicable demolition of the Argentine 6–0, 6–0. In the final he faced long-time nemesis David Nalbandian who prevailed in a fifth-set tiebreaker to deny Federer his third consecutive Masters Cup. This loss ended his 35-match winning streak that stretched back to the French Open and his record 24 consecutive finals won. Had he won the match, Federer would have tied John McEnroe's 1984 record for the highest yearly winning percentage in the open era (82–3)."

        "title": "2006 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "In what is widely considered to be one of the greatest individual tennis seasons of all time, Roger Federer was dominant in 2006, finishing the year with a 92–5 record. The world No. 1 maintained his ranking for the full calendar year and reached all four major finals in 2006, winning three of them. His only loss at the majors came against Rafael Nadal in the French Open final in four sets, 6–1, 1–6, 4–6, 6–7(4–7). This was the first time they had met in a major final. In the other three majors of the season, Federer defeated Nadal in the final of Wimbledon, 6–0, 7–6(7–5), 6–7(2–7), 6–3. He defeated Marcos Baghdatis, 5–7, 7–5, 6–0, 6–2, at the Australian Open and Andy Roddick, 6–2, 4–6, 7–5, 6–1, at the US Open.\nIn addition, Federer contested six Masters finals (out of the seven events he entered), winning four on hardcourt and losing two on clay to Nadal. Also, Federer won one ATP 500 series event in Tokyo, three ATP 250 series events in Doha, Halle, and Basel, and captured the year-end championship for the third time in his career.\nIn December 2011, Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2006 season as the second greatest Open Era season, behind Rod Laver's Grand Slam year of 1969.\nYear summary.\nFederer won three of the four Grand Slam singles tournaments for the second time and ended the year ranked world No. 1, with his points total being several thousand ahead of world No. 2 Nadal.\nEarly hard court season.\nFederer started the year off by winning the Qatar Open in Doha. This was his second consecutive championship in Doha, he defeated Frenchman Gaël Monfils 6–3, 7–6(7–5) in the final.\nAfter traveling down under, Federer won the year's first Grand Slam tournament, the Australian Open, by defeating Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis in four sets. This was Federer's seventh consecutive victory in a Grand Slam final (2003 Wimbledon – 2006 Australian Open), a record to start a career, and second overall only to Pete Sampras's eight consecutive wins (1995 Wimbledon – 2000 Wimbledon). This was Federer's 7th Grand Slam title, which tied him for sixth place in the open era with John McEnroe and Mats Wilander.\nMoving back to the Middle East, Federer reached the finals of the Dubai Tennis Championships without losing a set before losing to his budding arch-rival Rafael Nadal 6–2, 4–6, 4–6. This ended the 16-match winning streak that he had started the 2006 season on. It was also the first time Federer had lost a match on a hard court in over a year, the last time coming 13 months earlier in the semifinals of the 2005 Australian Open.\nFederer successfully defended his Masters title at the Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California, defeating American James Blake in the final 7–5, 6–3, 6–0. This was his third consecutive title in Indian Wells, which set the tournament record for most consecutive titles. This third championship also tied Michael Chang's record of three titles in Indian Wells.\nTwo weeks later he also successfully defended his Masters title at the Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, Florida, defeating Croatian Ivan Ljubičić in the final 7–6(7–5), 7–6(7–4), 7–6(8–6). With his victory in Miami he picked up his second masters title of the year, and became the first player ever to win the grueling Indian Wells-Key Biscayne double in consecutive years.\nClay court season.\nFederer started the clay-court season by reaching the final of the ATP Masters Series event at Monte Carlo. He opened the tournament with a scare needing three sets to defeat an 18-year-old Novak Djokovic; this was the first match between the two rivals, who have played in 50 matches as of August 2021. After reaching the final he lost in four sets to Nadal 2–6, 7–6(7–2), 3–6, 6–7(5–7).\nIn Italy Federer had a difficult road to the finals of Rome defeating Nicolás Almagro 6–3, 6–7(2–7), 7–5 in the quarters and David Nalbandian 6–3, 3–6, 7–6(7–5) in the semifinals. His encounter with Rafael Nadal in the finals saw Federer losing 7–6(7–0), 6–7(5–7), 4–6, 6–2, 6–7(5–7) in a five-set, five-hour and five-minute match that culminated in a decisive 7-5 tiebreak. Federer had held two championship points at 6–5 in the fifth set. Because of the physicality and grueling nature of the match, both players skipped the Hamburg Masters the following week.\nFederer only dropped two sets en route to the first French Open final of his career. He met the reigning champion Rafael Nadal in the final. Federer had gone undefeated in 2006 except against Nadal, compiling a 44–3 record heading into the finals. He got off to a fast start winning the first set decisively 6–1. But the relentless nature of Nadal's play, constantly hitting high bouncing shots to Federer's one-handed backhand, proved a devastating formula. Federer eventually lost the match in a fourth-set tiebreaker 6–1, 1–6, 4–6, 6–7(4–7). This ended the many predictions of Federer winning the calendar year Grand Slam in 2006. Although the French Open title eluded him, Federer became one of only two active players who had reached the finals of all four Grand Slam singles tournaments, the other being Andre Agassi.\nGrass court season.\nFederer won his fourth consecutive title at the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany. Federer had three close third set victories en route to making the final, including a thrilling triple tiebreak match against Olivier Rochus in the quarterfinals 6–7(2–7), 7–6(11–9), 7–6(7–5). In the final he defeated Tomáš Berdych 6–0, 6–7(4–7), 6–2.\nFederer entered Wimbledon as the top seed, trying to become the first man since Pete Sampras (1997–2000) to win Wimbledon in four consecutive years. Federer raced through the tournament without dropping a set and met his arch-rival Rafael Nadal in the finals. Federer had not defeated Nadal all season going 0–4 against Nadal but 5–4 overall heading into the final. Federer again thrashed Nadal in the first set, the same way he had in the opening set at Roland Garros, bageling the Spaniard 6–0. The second set was much closer with Federer taking the tiebreaker 7–5. Federer surrendered his first set of the tournament when he lost the third set in a tiebreaker 2–7. In the fourth set Federer reasserted his superior grass court play and took it by a score of 6–3. Federer won the final 6–0, 7–6(7–5), 6–7(2–7), 6–3. This was his fourth Wimbledon title and his 8th Grand Slam title of his career. With this Major title win he tied Andre Agassi, Jimmy Connors, and Ivan Lendl for sixth on the all-time Grand Slam list behind Bill Tilden (10), Rod Laver and Björn Borg (11), Roy Emerson (12), and Pete Sampras (14). After Wimbledon, Federer set his sights on winning the US Open.\nSummer hard court season.\nFederer then started his North American tour by winning his second Rogers Cup title in Toronto, defeating Richard Gasquet of France in the final 2–6, 6–3, 6–2.\nAfter his victory in Toronto, Federer entered the Cincinnati Masters as the defending champion looking to tie the all-time record he and Nadal set in 2005 of four masters titles in a single season. After reaching the finals of his first eleven tournaments in 2006, Federer was upset by 19-year-old British upstart Andy Murray. Following this loss to Murray, Federer would not lose another match for the remainder of the year. He finished the season with a perfect record of 29–0 (this would continue into 2007 and be part of his career best 41-match winning streak).\nDuring the US Open, the year's last Grand Slam tournament, he defeated American Andy Roddick in four sets 6–2, 4–6, 7–5, 6–1 for his third consecutive title at Flushing Meadows. During the open era, 2006 is the only year in which the same man (Federer) and woman (Justine Henin) reached the finals of all four Grand Slams. This was Federer's 9th Grand Slam title, which put him in sole possession of 6th place on the all-time Grand Slam list.\nFall indoor season.\nTokyo was the last outdoor event that Federer participated in during the season. He defeated Tim Henman in the final, 6–3, 6–3.\nWith victory in Asia, Federer turned his focus to the indoor circuit of Europe. He entered the Madrid Masters for the first time since 2003. After a close third-round match against Robin Söderling, Federer defeated Fernando González 7–5, 6–1, 6–0 in the final. This was his fourth Masters title of the year, which tied the all-time record held by himself and Nadal in 2005.\nFederer entered his hometown tournament, the Swiss Indoors held in Basel, having never won it despite having reached the final in 2000 and 2001. Federer won a final-set tiebreaker against Paradorn Srichaphan in the semifinals, to advance to the final where he defeated González, 6–3, 6–2, 7–6(7–3). This victory was especially touching for Federer who had grown up in Basel and had been a ball boy at the tournament during his youth.\nAt the year-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, Federer defeated the defending champion David Nalbandian during the round-robin stage. He also scored his second victory of the year over Nadal, 6–4, 7–5 in a thrilling semifinal matchup of the top 2 players in the world. Federer then resoundingly defeated James Blake, 6–0, 6–3, 6–4, in the final to win his third Masters Cup title.\nSeason accomplishments.\nFederer won 12 titles in 2006, which included three Grand Slam titles, four ATP Masters titles, and the Tennis Masters Cup. He tied a record for the ATP Tour (since 1990) with Thomas Muster, which was done during the 1995 season.\nDuring the year, he lost to only two players: Nadal in the French Open, Rome, Monte Carlo, and Dubai finals; and Andy Murray in the second round of the Masters Series tournament in Cincinnati. The Cincinnati loss to Murray was Federer's only straight-set loss of the year and the only tournament out of 17 in which he did not reach the final.\nHis win–loss record for the 2006 season was 92–5, falling slightly behind his 2005 season record of 81–4."

        "title": "2007 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer made all four Major finals in 2007, winning three of them. He defeated Fernando González, 7–6(2), 6–4, 6–4, at the Australian Open, Rafael Nadal, 7–6(7), 4–6, 7–6(3), 2–6, 6–2, at Wimbledon, and Novak Djokovic, 7–6(4), 7–6(2), 6–4, at the US Open. However, Federer lost the 2007 French Open final to Nadal, 3–6, 6–4, 3–6, 4–6. Federer made five ATP Masters Series 1000 Finals in 2007, but only won two of those, in Hamburg and Cincinnati. Federer won 1 ATP 500 series event in Dubai. He ended the year by winning the year-end championships for the fourth time. In 2011 Stephen Tignor, chief editorial writer for Tennis.com, ranked Federer's 2007 season as the sixth greatest season of all-time during the Open Era.\nYear summary.\nEarly Hard Court Season.\nFederer entered the Australian Open with a 29 match winning streak dating back to 2006 US Open. In the fourth round Federer faced future world no. 1 and multi-slam winner Novak Djokovic for the first time in a major, defeating him in straight sets. In the semifinals Federer faced American Andy Roddick in a highly anticipated rematch of the 2006 US Open final. Federer delivered a masterclass, crushing the American and delivering the most one sided match of their rivalry 6–4, 6–0, 6–2. Federer won his third Australian Open and 10th Grand Slam singles title, defeating Fernando González of Chile in the final. He became the first man since Björn Borg in 1980 to win a Grand Slam singles tournament without losing a set. At the end of the tournament Federer's winning streak stood at 36 consecutive matches, besting his previous career best 35 match winning streak in 2005.\nFederer next played in Dubai where he was a three time former champion. Federer again played Djokovic in the quarterfinals and prevailed in a tight three set match. He defeated Mikhail Youzhny in the finals to capture his fourth Dubai title in the last five years. After his victory Federer's winning streak stood at 41 consecutive matches, just five shy of the all-time record held by Guillermo Vilas in 1977.\nEntering Indian Wells, Federer was the three-time defending champion. He needed only to make the finals to tie Vilas' all-time record and if he won would have set a new all-time record for consecutive victories at 47. His winning streak of 41 consecutive matches, however, ended when he lost to Guillermo Cañas in the second round of the Pacific Life Open. This was a surprising loss and the first time he had suffered a defeat in six months.\nThe following week at the Sony Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Florida, he entered as the two-time defending champion. This tournament was disappointing as Federer again lost to Cañas, this time in the fourth round in three sets. However, he was awarded four ATP Awards during a ceremony at the tournament, making him the first player to receive four awards during the same year.\nClay Court Season.\nFederer started his clay-court season by reaching his second consecutive final of the Monte Carlo Masters. He did not drop a set until the finals, but lost again to second seed Nadal.\nFederer also lost in the third round of the Internazionali d'Italia in Rome to Filippo Volandri. It was the first time that he had lost to anyone other than Nadal on clay since the 2005 Monte Carlo Masters. This defeat meant he had gone four tournaments without a title, his longest stretch since becoming world no. 1.\nFederer rebounded, however, to defeat Nadal on clay for the first time, winning his fourth Hamburg Masters title, and ending Nadal's clay court streak of 81 consecutive matches.\nAfter his victory over Nadal on clay two weeks earlier in Hamburg, speculation started on whether Federer could become the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four major titles simultaneously. Entering Roland Garros he was reigning champion of Wimbledon, the US Open, and the Australian Open and a victory at the French would mark a historical non-calendar year Grand Slam. At the French Open, Federer raced through the tournament, dropping only one set before reaching the final for the second consecutive year. Entering the final Federer had a 27 match winning streak at the majors and was seeking revenge for his 4 set loss to Nadal in the 2006 final. Federer played well in the final, but could not convert on the many opportunities he had to break the Nadal serve. Federer was 0 for 10 on break point chances in the first set, and only 1 for 17 overall. The result was a defeat at the hands of his arch-rival for the second straight year at the French finals, in four sets.\nGrass Court Season.\nOne day after the loss, Federer announced that he was withdrawing from his usual warm-up tournament in Halle, which he had won the last four years, citing fatigue and fear of getting an injury.\nHe, therefore, entered Wimbledon for the first time without having played a warm-up grass-court tournament. Federer, nevertheless, reached the finals of Wimbledon for the fifth time, only dropping one set. The final was a rematch of 2006 as Federer again faced his nemesis Rafael Nadal. The final would prove to be an epic, delivering the first five set final at Wimbledon since 2001. Federer won the first set in a tight tiebreaker which he won 9–7. Nadal responded in the second and took it 6–4, leveling the match at one set apiece. A pivotal third set was decided by another tiebreaker which Federer claimed 7–3. After the first three sets Federer was only one set away from his fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship. Nadal, however, refused to go down quietly and took the fourth set decisively by a score of 6–2. As they entered the ultimate fifth set both players knew the value of a single break. Federer faced two early fifth set crises when he found himself down double break point in the third and fifth games. Federer, however, saved all four break points to take a 3–2 lead. In the sixth game Federer finally broke the Nadal serve and closed out the championship 6–2 in the final set. This match marked the first time in Federer's career that he was pushed to a fifth set in the finals of a Slam and remained his only five set final victory at a major until 2009 Wimbledon. With this victory Federer tied Björn Borg's open-era men's record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles. He also tied Rod Laver and Björn Borg with 11 Grand Slam titles, moving into third place all-time.\nSummer Hard Court Season.\nFederer began the hard-court season in August in Montreal at the Canadian Open as the defending champion. Federer advanced through the tournament without dropping a set and faced the young world no. 4 Novak Djokovic in the finals. Entering the final Federer had never lost to the young Serbian, holding a 4–0 record against him. The first set was a back and forth affair with Federer squandering triple set point on his own serve and losing the tiebreaker. Federer, however, ran away with the second set and forced a final set for the championship. Djokovic prevailed in a final-set tiebreaker, defeating Federer for the first time.\nThe following week Federer entered the Cincinnati Masters. He reached the final, surviving a final-set tiebreaker scare against Lleyton Hewitt in the semifinals. Federer won the Cincinnati title for the second time, defeating James Blake in the final. The victory was Federer's 50th career singles title, his 14th ATP Masters Series title, and made him the winner of the 2007 US Open Series points race.\nAs the winner of U.S. Open Series, Federer had never entered the US Open in a stronger position. Federer lost the opening set in his third and fourth round matches before recovering to defeat John Isner and Feliciano López respectively. His quarterfinal match was especially compelling since it was a rematch of the 2006 final against Andy Roddick. Federer defeated Roddick in straight sets in a match that featured two tiebreakers. Federer reached the finals and faced rising star and world no. 3 Novak Djokovic who had defeated Federer just a few weeks prior in the finals of Montreal. Djokovic started the match hot and quickly found himself at triple set point on his own serve. Federer saved all set points and snatched the first set in a close tiebreaker (it was an exact reversal of the first set just weeks before in Montreal). Djokovic would not yield, however, and again took Federer to a tiebreaker in the second set. Federer again prevailed in the tiebreaker and capitalized on this by taking a close third set as well. Federer's victory over the third seed Djokovic delivered his 12th Grand Slam singles title, and fourth consecutive US Open title. This victory moved him ahead of Laver and Borg for third on the all-time list of Grand Slam champions. As champion of the US Open Series points race, Federer received a bonus of $1 million, in addition to the $1.4 million prize for winning the US Open singles title. He became the only player in history to win three Grand Slams in a year for three years (2004, 2006, 2007). Throughout the tournament the American press labeled him Darth Federer for his all-black attire and the tournament played The Imperial March from Star Wars when he was announced onto the court for each of his matches. The Imperial March was also played by the tournament officials after the final match point, in honor of Federer's achievement.\nFall Indoor Season.\nFederer began the indoor season as the defending champion at the Madrid Masters. Fresh off wins at the Cincinnati Masters and the US Open, Federer was the clear favorite to win the tournament. He advanced to the finals without dropping a set and faced his early career nemesis David Nalbandian. Federer took the first set easily but was defeated in three sets by the red-hot Argentine. Notably, Nalbandian had consecutively beaten Nadal, Djokovic, and Federer in Madrid to claim his first masters title.\nFederer next entered his home-town tournament in Basel as the defending champion. He dropped only one set en route to his second Basel title and his third title in his native Switzerland.\nThe last masters tournament of the year at Bercy was a brief affair for Federer who fell again to Nalbandian, this time in the third round. The streaking Argentine would go on to defeat Nadal in the finals of Bercy.\nFederer then finished the season at the year-end Tennis Masters Cup. Despite losing for the first time in the round-robin group to Fernando González, he regrouped against Roddick and Davydenko to advance. Federer went on to defeat Nadal in the semifinals and David Ferrer in the tournament finals to win his fourth Tennis Masters Cup title, finishing the season in style.\nSeason Accomplishments.\nFederer finished the year as the world no. 1 player for the fourth consecutive time, compiling an impressive 68–9 record. Due to his performance on the court and off-court personality, in 2007, Time magazine named him as one of the 100 most important persons in the world. Rod Laver, one of the greatest players ever himself, described him as follows: \"One thing is for sure: he's the best player of his time and one of the most admirable champions on the planet. That's certainly something worth crowing over. The beauty is, Roger Federer won't.\"."

        "title": "2008 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer won one major in 2008, the US Open, defeating Briton Andy Murray, 6–2, 7–5, 6–2. Federer was defeated by Rafael Nadal in two Grand Slam finals: at the French Open, which he lost 1–6, 3–6, 0–6, and at Wimbledon in a famous five-setter, 4–6, 4–6, 7–6, 7–6, 7–9, when he was aiming for six straight wins to break Björn Borg's record. At the Australian Open, Federer lost in the semifinals to Novak Djokovic, ending his record streak of 10 consecutive Major finals. Roger Federer lost twice in Master Series 1000 Finals on clay to Nadal at Monte Carlo and Hamburg. However, Federer was able to capture three more victories in 250-level events at Estoril, Halle, and Basel.\nIn doubles, Federer and compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka won the gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nFederer began the year by attempting to defend his title at the Australian Open. Federer suffered an illness related to food poisoning prior to the start of the Australian Open. He lost, however, in the semifinals to eventual champion Djokovic, 5–7, 3–6, 6–7. This ended his record of ten consecutive Grand Slam finals, the most ever for a men's player.\nIn March, Federer revealed that he had recently been diagnosed with mononucleosis and that he may have suffered from it as early as December 2007. He noted, however, that he was now \"medically cleared to compete\". Despite being cleared to compete Federer admitted that he had suffered a significant dip in fitness due to his struggle with mononucleosis, which would prove to negatively impact his results till the Miami Masters in which he lost to long-time foe, Andy Roddick.\nAlthough Federer was seeded first and was the defending champion at the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships, he lost to Murray in the first round. On 10 March, Federer won his third exhibition match out of four against former world no. 1 Pete Sampras at Madison Square Garden in New York City, 6–3, 6–7, 7–6.\nClay court season.\nFederer began the clay-court season at the Estoril Open in Portugal. This was his first tournament with coach José Higueras. and his first non-Master Series clay-court tournament since Gstaad in 2004. Federer won his first tournament of the year, when Nikolay Davydenko retired from the final while trailing, 7–6, 1–2 with a leg ligament strain.\nFederer then played three Masters Series tournaments on clay. At the Masters Series Monte Carlo, Federer lost to three-time defending champion Rafael Nadal in the final in straight sets. Federer made 44 unforced errors, lost a 4–0 lead in the second set, and fell to 1–7 against Nadal on clay courts. At the Internazionali BNL d'Italia, Federer lost in the quarterfinals to Radek Štěpánek. Federer was the defending champion at the Masters Series Hamburg, but lost to Nadal in the final.\nAt the French Open, Federer was defeated quickly by Nadal in the final, 1–6, 3–6, 0–6. This was the fourth consecutive year that Federer and Nadal had played at the French Open, with Federer losing his third consecutive final to Nadal. Federer's record of 23–4 (2005–08) at the French Open is second only to Nadal's record of 28–0 during the same period.\nGrass court season.\nFederer bounced back by winning the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany without dropping a set or a service game. This was the fifth time he had won this event. With this result, he tied Pete Sampras's record for most titles on grass in the open era with 10.\nAt Wimbledon, Federer once again played world no. 2 Nadal in the final. A victory for Federer would have meant his sixth consecutive Wimbledon singles title, breaking Borg's modern era men's record and equaling the all-time record held since 1886 by William Renshaw. Federer saved two championship points in the fourth set tiebreak, but eventually lost the match, 4–6, 4–6, 7–6, 7–6, 7–9. The rain-delayed match ended in near darkness after 4 hours, 48 minutes of play, making it the longest (in terms of elapsed time) men's final in Wimbledon recorded history. It concluded 7 hours, 15 minutes after its scheduled start. The defeat also ended Federer's 65-match winning streak on grass. John McEnroe described the match as \"The greatest match I've ever seen.\" After Nadal surpassed him as world no. 1 later in the year, Federer stated that his main goal would be to regain the Wimbledon title, rather than the top spot.\nSummer hard court season.\nFederer made early exits in his next two singles tournaments, the Rogers Cup in Toronto, Ontario, Canada and the Western &amp; Southern Financial Group Masters in Cincinnati, Ohio. Federer was chosen to carry the national flag at the Beijing Olympics. \nAt the Summer Olympics in Beijing, Federer lost in the quarterfinals to James Blake for the first time in their nine matches. Federer however, finally won his first Olympic gold medal in the men's doubles, when he and compatriot Stanislas Wawrinka upset the world no. 1 doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan of the United States in the semifinals and defeated Sweden's Simon Aspelin and Thomas Johansson in the final, 6–3, 6–4, 6–7, 6–3. The following day, Federer lost his world no. 1 ranking to Nadal after 237 consecutive weeks.\nAt the US Open, Federer reached the fourth round without dropping a set. He defeated third-seeded Novak Djokovic in a rematch of the 2007 US Open Final, 6–3, 5–7, 7–5, 6–2, in the semifinals, and then defeated Andy Murray, who was playing in his first Grand Slam final, 6–2, 7–5, 6–2, to win his fifth straight US Open title and 13th career Grand Slam title, leaving him one Grand Slam title from tying Pete Sampras's all-time record of 14. This extended his US Open winning streak to 34 matches. Federer became the first player in tennis history to have five consecutive wins at both Wimbledon and the US Open.\nFall indoor season.\nAt the Mutua Madrileña Masters Madrid, Federer reached the semifinals without losing a set. There he lost to Murray, 6–3, 3–6, 5–7. Meanwhile, he became the all-time leader in career prize money in men's tennis, earning over US$43.3 million at the end of the tournament and surpassing 14-time Grand Slam singles champion Pete Sampras.\nFederer won his 57th career title at the Davidoff Swiss Indoors in Basel, beating David Nalbandian in the final. He became the only player in history to win the title three consecutive years.\nHe reached the quarterfinals of his next event, the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris, before withdrawing because of back pain. This was the first time in Federer's career of 763 matches that he had withdrawn from a tournament. This meant that 2008 was the first year since 2003 in which he did not win a Masters Series title. Federer entered the Tennis Masters Cup as the top-seeded player, after Nadal withdrew from the tournament. He drew Simon, Murray, and Roddick in the Red Group. In his opening match, Federer lost to Simon, but kept his hopes alive by defeating Roddick's replacement, Stepanek, in his second match. He lost his third match to Murray, 6–4, 6–7, 5–7. Federer had received medical treatment for back and hip problems in the third set, but lost after saving seven match points. However, Federer still ended the year ranked world no. 2.\nMatches.\nAll matches.\nDoubles.\nSource (ATP)"

It depicts General Manuel Belgrano holding the Flag of Argentina, and it is made of bronze over a pedestal of granite. \nHistory.\nIn 1870 generals Bartolomé Mitre, Enrique Martínez and Manuel José Guerrico appointed a commission with the task of making a monument for Manuel Belgrano. This was requested to the French sculptor Louis-Robert Carrier-Belleuse, who would make the statue of Belgrano, and Manuel de Santa Coloma, who designed the horse. It was finished in 1872 and moved to Buenos Aires, where it was dedicated on September 24, 1873, at an anniversary of the Battle of Tucumán. More than 20,000 people were present at the ceremony, and the Argentine National Anthem was played at Teatro Colón that night. \nDuring the government of Marcelo Torcuato de Alvear it was thought that the base was too low, so it was raised. During the work the monument was rotated as well, and instead of watching towards to Buenos Aires Cabildo it was made to look to the North, so that it didn't show his back to the Casa Rosada."

The club competes in the PAC Rugby Conference, the Southern California Rugby Football Union, and the Gold Coast Conference of Intercollegiate Rugby, and Nationals annually. Training sessions are held twice a week: Mondays from 8–10 pm at Brittingham Field and Wednesdays from 6–8 pm at Allyson Felix Field.\nThe Trojans' home field is Allyson Felix Field, located in the heart of USC's University Park Campus in Los Angeles, California. The team’s alumni, including notable former players Joseph Krassenstein and Christian Kwan, remain involved as assistant coaches, contributing to the rich tradition and ongoing success of the program.\nHistory.\nRugby is USC's oldest club sport. The team was founded in 1886. It was briefly replaced by American Football at USC before a British professor on tenure brought the game back to the university in 1910.\nThe first issue of the student newspaper The Daily Trojan, then called The Daily Southern Californian, was published on 16 September 1912, and the first edition of the paper included announcements of tryouts for the USC rugby team.\nUSC Rugby Hall of Fame member Dave Lytle retired in 2015 after 28 years of coaching. In addition to his many victories, he holds the team record for the longest keg stand at 2 minutes, 23 seconds.\nIn 2009, USC beat UCLA 17–14, their first victory over the Bruins in many years and the last time they did in that decade. That team was undefeated in league play, beating California State University, Fullerton 51–12 in the championship. They went on to beat University of San Diego in the promotion match to earn a spot in Division I the following season.\nIn 2018, Coach Steve \"Staggy\" Stagg became head coach and led USC Rugby to beat the Bruins in the Coliseum in 2022. The team won the D1 Blue Division Nationals in Atlanta that same season. The season after, the team continued its glorious winning spell, conquering the GCCIR tournament and winning the finals against USD. In the Spring season of 2023, USC Rugby went to Maryland to compete in the top division for rugby in the US; due to extreme weather conditions, the tournament was suspended halfway through. In the fall season of 2023, USC Rugby clashed once more with USD in the GCCIR finals, this time a lack of depth in the squad due to multiple injuries caused the Trojans to fall short to USD losing 24–21.\nUSC Rugby is now coached by Frederick Riaz. Coach Riaz took over the program in January 2024 after a 5 year spell as the head coach of the Tsunami Barbarians."

The tournament comprises the winners of the various high school athletic associations in New York:\nFor geographic reasons, some Catholic and independent schools in upstate New York and Long Island compete in the NYSPHSAA.\nThe championship games are held each March. The 2020 tournament was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic.\nHistory.\nFollowing a 45-year ban on high school basketball state championship tournaments in New York State, the State Education Department granted approval in 1978 for the first boys Federation tournament to be conducted on an experimental basis. The original boys tournament was named the Super Sixteen tournament, as the four associations (NYSPHSAA, PSAL, CHSAA and NYSAISAA) competed in four classes, based primarily on student-body size. The four classes were called AAA, AA, A and B in 1979. From 1981 through 2003, the four classes were called A, B, C and D. In September 2000, the tournament became known as the Federation Tournament of Champions. Beginning with the 2004 tournament, competition has been held in three classes (AA, A and B).\nFollowing a three-year hiatus caused by the COVID pandemic, the Federation tournament returned in 2023, albeit on a smaller scale with games held at school sites around the Capital District. The tournament was put on indefinite pause after the 2023 edition: schools cited a decrease in interest from fans and media, plus a desire for athletes to start their spring sporting seasons earlier.\nVenues.\nAfter the first two tournaments were held in Syracuse and Rochester in 1979 and 1980, the competition moved to Glens Falls through 2010 and then to Albany. In 2015, because the Times Union Center was used for the NCAA Women's Basketball Albany Regional, the Federation tournament was held at SEFCU Arena, the home court of the University at Albany, SUNY basketball teams. The tournament moved back to Glens Falls in 2017.\nClassifications.\nFor 2015, the NYSPHSAA classification enrollment cutoffs were as follows, counting the number of 9th, 10th and 11th grade students in the previous scholastic year (enrollment is doubled for all-boys schools):\nPSAL, CHSAA and NYSAISAA have their own classification systems, not tied directly to student enrollments.\nA school may elect to play in a higher classification, but may not elect to play in a lower classification.\nWinners and Runners Up.\nResults through 2020:\nChampionships by school.\nResults through 2020:\nChampionships by association.\nResults through 2020:"

        "text": "The All-EuroLeague Team is an award for Europe's premier level league, the EuroLeague, that is given to the league's top ten basketball players for each season, since the 2000–01 season. During the FIBA era of the EuroLeague, players were honored first by being a part of the FIBA Festival, and later by being selected to the FIBA EuroStars. Under FIBA, the EuroLeague also originally featured a EuroLeague Final Four Team selection, which was a forerunner of the All-EuroLeague Team award, and which consisted of the five best players of the EuroLeague Final Four.\nIn a year in which European professional club basketball was divided between the Euroleague Basketball-organized 2000–01 EuroLeague, and the FIBA-organized 2000–01 FIBA SuproLeague, it was the Euroleague Basketball organized competition that selected the inaugural All-EuroLeague Team.\nWithin the inaugural team, only Rashard Griffith of Virtus Bologna had reached the competition's semifinals with his team, and only one other player, Fortitudo Bologna's Gregor Fučka, made it to the competition's quarterfinals with his. With the exception of that original All-EuroLeague Team selection, team success has been capital for a player to achieve All-EuroLeague status, in the great majority of cases. The priority of the team success criteria, as a part of the media member's voting, was unofficially established, after the merger of Euroleague Basketball's EuroLeague, and FIBA Europe's FIBA SuproLeague, at the end of the 2000–01 season.\nVoting criteria.\nTeam success, and not individual stats, is the paramount criteria in the selection process. Each season's All-EuroLeague Team consists of ten players total, with five players chosen for both the First and Second Team.\nIn the selection process, through the 2010–11 EuroLeague season, each voter had to choose 2 point guards, 4 shooting guards and/or small forwards, and 4 power forwards and/or centers. The players were listed by the positions that the EuroLeague deemed to place them at for the voting process, even though in some cases, this may not have properly reflected what position the player usually played at, nor reflect if some players often played at multiple positions.\nSince the 2011–12 EuroLeague season, voting is no longer limited by position, as 5 players are picked by both the fan and media voters, regardless of their positions. This change was made to give voters the opportunity to choose any players they want for the team, rather than limiting them to choices based on positions. Online fan voting accounts for 25% of the vote total, while media voting for the remaining 75%.\nThe online fan vote for the All-EuroLeague Team is collected through online voting at the EuroLeague's official website, which allows for one vote every 24 hours from each individual IP address. The player that receives the most online fan votes for the All-EuroLeague Team, also receives the full 25% of the fan's vote for the EuroLeague MVP choice.\nAll-EuroLeague Team by season.\nAll-EuroLeague Team since the voting has not been by position.\nNotes:\nPlayers with multiple All-EuroLeague Team selections.\nPlayers are listed by the nationality that they are registered under in their national domestic leagues, being the one the EuroLeague officially considers. The following table only lists players with at least two total selections.\nExternal links.\n&lt;br&gt;"

He started the game as Cleveland's catcher, before moving to left field in the fifth inning. Recounting the game, the \"Detroit Free Press\" levied harsh criticism of his play in the field, writing: \"[Cleveland] tried an experiment behind the bat in the person of a big Chicagoan named Dwyer, whom they brought along as a catcher. He was not a success, and when they took the field in the fifth inning he was sent out into left field. This was poor judgement, for while he did not do good work behind the bat, he was utterly useless in the field expect to throw balls back to the diamond, and the Detroit boys faced around and sent them out to him.\"\nDwyer allowed two passed balls while recording an assist. At the plate, he went hitless but did record a run batted in.\nThe following day, Dwyer told a \"Free Press\" reporter that despite the paper referring to him as a \"Chicagoan\" the day before, he actually lived in Colorado and had been playing baseball in Iowa, but had been in Chicago the day before the game. Dwyer told the reporter that he was no condition to play the game after not sleeping on his trip from Chicago, and alleged that Cleveland pitcher George Bradley was crossing him up intentionally.\nThe following spring, Dwyer signed with the Trenton, New Jersey club of the Interstate Association. He played in 25 games before asking for his own release in August."

He also features two effective off-speed pitches, a curveball at 74–77 mph and a changeup at 83–85 mph. The curve is his most common pitch when ahead in the count, and is a frequent offering with 2 strikes. His changeup is typically used earlier in the count and is mostly thrown to right-handed hitters. All three pitches have above-average whiff rates (including 51% for the changeup), leading to a high strikeout rate."

        "title": "2019 Pan American Games",
        "text": "The 2019 Pan American Games (), officially the XVIII Pan American Games and commonly known as the Peru 2019 Pan-Am Games or Peru 2019 (), were a multi-sport event governed by the Panam Sports Organization held in Lima, Peru from July 26 to August 11, 2019, with preliminary rounds in certain events having begun on July 24, 2019. These were the first Pan American Games to be held in Peru, and the seventh to be held in South America.\nThe opening ceremony took place on July 26 at the National Stadium of Peru, and the Games were declared open by former Peruvian President Martín Vizcarra. These Pan American Games were held at venues in and around Lima, and are the largest sporting event ever hosted by the country.\nBidding process.\nA total of four bids were submitted for the 2019 Pan American Games, and they were officially announced on February 1, 2013. These were Lima in Peru, Santiago in Chile, Ciudad Bolívar in Venezuela and La Punta in Argentina. Lima bid for the games for the second consecutive time after losing to Toronto for the 2015 edition of the games. Santiago had won the rights to stage the 1975 and 1987 Pan American Games but withdrew both times before hosting. The other two cities bid for the games for the first time. Lima was elected as the host city on October 11, 2013, where PASO members gathered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada to elect the host city. The city was considered the favourite to win the rights to host throughout the contest.\nDevelopment and preparation.\nVenues.\nThe events were held in various Lima districts and neighboring cities, with most of them concentrated in the clusters of VIDENA (a complex in the San Luis District), Pan American Park (Villa María del Triunfo), the Sports Village of Callao, and a sports complex in Costa Verde.\nFinancing.\nThe total budget is estimated at US$1.2 billion, with $470 million in sports infrastructure, $180 million building the Pan American Village, $430 million spent in organization, and $106 million for other expenses.\nAthletes' Village.\n9,500 athletes and team officials were accommodated in a complex with 1,700 units in Villa El Salvador.\nTorch relay.\nThe torch was sent from Mexico to Lima by sailboat, and the torch relay started in Machu Picchu. The torch had toured through 23 cities over 23 days and covered 5,500 kilometers en route to the Peru National Stadium in Lima on July 26, 2019, for the opening ceremony. The cities include Machu Picchu, Ollantaytambo, Cusco, Puno, Lake Titicaca, Arequipa, Camaná, Nazca, Ica, Ayacucho, Huancavelica, Cerro de Pasco, Huánuco, Tocache, Tarapoto, Bagua Grande, Piura, Cajamarca, Trujillo and Huaraz.\nThe Games.\nCeremonies.\nThe opening ceremony of the games took place on July 26, 2019, and the closing ceremony took place on August 11, 2019.\nParticipating National Olympic Committees.\nAll 41 nations who are members of the Pan American Sports Organization competed at the event. The numbers in parentheses represents the number of athletes a country qualified.\nSports.\n419 events in 38 sports were contested in Lima, the largest number of medal events ever held at a single edition of the Pan American Games until that date. Bodybuilding and surfing were contested at the Pan-Am Games for the first time in 2019, basque pelota was reinstated after being absent from the 2015 Games, and women's baseball was dropped after debuting in 2015.\nAlmost all of the new events being contested at the 2020 Summer Olympics were already on the Pan-Am Games' program. Sport climbing was excluded because it did not have the required number of national federations in the Americas to be eligible for inclusion. Skateboarding was pulled from the program in May 2019; Panam Sports cited that World Skate had diminished the quality of the event by having not made the Games be a qualifier for the Olympics, and its partner Street League Skateboarding (SLS) having scheduled a World Tour event in Los Angeles that conflicted with the Games.\nThe new disciplines that were scheduled to be introduced for the 2020 Summer Olympics were also added, including the 4 × 100m mixed medley relay, men's 800m and women's 1,500m in swimming, 3-on-3 basketball, BMX freestyle park, two new women's boxing events, Madison track cycling, the transfer of three men's events to mixed team events in shooting, table tennis mixed doubles, archery mixed team, and triathlon mixed relay. There was a reduction of one men's weightlifting event, and all canoe events being gender-neutral (removing a men's event from each discipline). 19 extra events were also added, including the 1m springboard in diving, as well three events in compound archery, modern pentathlon relays (with mixed, men's, and women's events), 49er, Nacra 17 and kiteboarding (the latter two replacing the Hobie 16 and J/24) events in sailing, extreme canoe slalom, mixed doubles squash, women's wakeboard, poomsae events in taekwondo, women's 50 km race walking, and men's and woman's doubles events in table tennis.\n\"Numbers in parentheses indicate the number of medal events to be contested in each sport/discipline.\"\nCalendar.\nThe calendar was unveiled on April 18, 2019, 100 days ahead to the start of the competition.\nMedia.\nBroadcasting.\nMediapro served as host broadcaster. The Lima Convention Centre hosted the International Broadcast Centre (IBC). Panam Sports also launched the \"Panam Sports Channel\" on its website, which featured supplemental video content from the Games hosted by local personality Alexandra Hörler.\nMarketing.\nLogo.\nThe official logo of the 2019 Pan American Games is inspired by the amancay, an indigenous flower that flourishes from June 24 through September 30. The flower and its pistils represent three athletes with open arms and the three Americas, with the identity of Lima. It was designed by Peruvian graphic designers Juan Diego Sanz and Jorge Luis Zárate.\nMascot.\nIn June 2017, after over a thousand submissions, the organising committee revealed the final three in the running to be the mascot of the games. The final three designs were: \"Milco\", which was influenced by Cuchimilco sculptures (pre-Hispanic figures of Chancay culture developed in Lima around 1200–1470 A.D.); a flower named \"Amantis\"; and \"Wayqi\", a leaf-toed gecko. In July 2017, it was announced \"Milco\" was the winner of the contest, receiving 45% of the vote. There was approximately 44,154 votes cast in the contest, the most ever for a mascot competition for the Pan American Games. The winning designer of the competition was awarded 15,000 Peruvian sol (or approximately US$4,600). Milco's body is orange and the colour of his shorts is red, while his T-shirt is white, representing the colors of the Peruvian flag. Milco was designed by 24-year-old Andrea Norka Medrano Moy."

        "text": "The 2009–10 Duquesne Dukes men's basketball team represented Duquesne University in 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season.\nDuquesne hoped to build on the success of the 2008–09 season and began the new year with five straight victories. Soon, however, a string of setbacks hit the team, including the loss of two players, one due to injury and the other to suspension. Duquesne lost its final non-conference game and slipped into a five-game losing streak. The team did manage to break the streak, but had trouble gaining any momentum. In mid-February the Dukes finally seemed to break free with a solid 21 point victory over La Salle, followed by a crucial road upset of the University of Charlotte, which was ranked first in the Atlantic 10 Conference at the time, and finally another upset of the University of Dayton Flyers in front of a sellout Pittsburgh crowd. However, Duquesne then lost its final two road games of the season.\nDespite its lackluster season's end, Duquesne won an invitation to the College Basketball Invitational postseason tournament. The team lost to the Princeton Tigers, and the Dukes were eliminated in the first round, ending the 2009 season.\nDuquesne University.\nDuquesne University, also called Duquesne University of the Holy Spirit, is a private Catholic university in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States. The university's Duquesne Dukes compete in NCAA Division I (D-I). D-I schools are generally the major collegiate athletic powers, with larger budgets, more elaborate facilities, and higher numbers of athletic scholarships in comparison to Division II and III. This level was once called the University Division of the NCAA, and the Division II and III levels, the College Division; this terminology was replaced with the current numeric (I, II, III) divisions in 1973.\nThe Dukes have played twice in national championship games in the 1950s and won the National Invitation Tournament championship in 1955, when the NIT was the premier collegiate basketball tournament in the country. The men's basketball Dukes annually play its cross-town rival, the University of Pittsburgh Panthers, in Pittsburgh's highly anticipated and well-attended City Game. The current head coach is Ron Everhart, who has a two-year record of 27–32 (13–19 in the Atlantic 10 Conference). Well-known Duquesne players of the past include All-Americans Chuck Cooper, Sihugo Green, Dick Ricketts and Willie Somerset, and Norm Nixon, who won the Most Outstanding Player in Duquesne's 57–54 victory over the Villanova Wildcats in the 1977 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament.\nPreseason.\nDuquesne lost only one starter, Aaron Jackson, from the 2008–09 team which ended with a record of 21–13, the first time since 1981 that the school had 20 or more wins in a season. Picked to finish 12th in the Atlantic 10, Duquesne went on to finish second, losing to Temple by only five points in the conference championship game. This earned Duquesne a bid into the National Invitation Tournament, its first postseason appearance since 1994. The team was eliminated in a double-overtime first round loss to Virginia Tech, but the Dukes' unlikely success inspired the hope of a return to the NIT, or perhaps even the NCAA tournament.\nOn May 12, 2009, the school announced that two freshman forwards, Shawntez Patterson and Aleksandar Milovic, had been released from their scholarships and cleared to transfer to other schools. Both saw limited action in the 2008 season. Shawntez Patterson transferred to Pensacola Junior College, and Aleksandar Milovic transferred to the University of Hawaii.\nAndre Marhold, a small forward and the first of two incoming freshmen, signed with Duquesne on April 16. Marhold, a native of Pittsburgh who moved to North Carolina for High School, averaged 17.0 points and 10.0 rebounds per game his senior year, in which his team was the regular season champion. He was ranked 188 in the top 1000 high school seniors by Hoop Scoop. Marhold turned down scholarship offers from Clemson, Charlotte, and Purdue.\nSeveral weeks later on May 13, guard Sean Johnson of Queens, New York also signed with the team. He attended Christ the King high school, whose basketball team finished his senior year ranked fourth in the state and eleventh in the nation by ESPN. He averaged 22.4 points per game and was named New York City Catholic High School Athletic Association Most Valuable Player. Johnson also received scholarship offers from Nebraska, Manhattan, and Quinnipiac.\nPrior to the start of the season, ESPN picked Duquesne to finish fifth in the Atlantic 10 conference, noting the loss of star Aaron Jackson but looking with optimism at the addition of center Morakinyo Williams and the continued development of other stars. Sophomore Melquan Bolding was also highlighted by ESPN as a key player in the Atlantic 10.\nRoster.\nSource\nCoaching staff.\nRon Everhart returned for his fourth season as head coach. After the departure of previous coach Danny Nee, Everhart steadily improved the team's record year after year, taking the team from 3–24 the year before he arrived to the 21–13 record of 2008–09. Everhart attended Virginia Tech, from which he graduated in 1985. He served as an assistant coach at Georgia Tech, Virginia Military Institute, and Tulane University. In 1995, he took his first head coaching job at McNeese State University, and also coached at Northeastern University before moving to Duquesne in 2006.\nBill Barton returned for his third season as Associate Head Coach. Steve Hall and Scott Rigot both served as assistant coaches for their second year. Jason Byrd was the Director of Basketball Operations.\nRegular season.\nExhibition, Nicholls State, and Iowa.\nThe Dukes played their first game of the season on November 7 in an exhibition match against Division III La Roche. Duquesne scored a 47-point victory in which Damian Saunders led in scoring with 17 points. Despite the solid win, Duquesne made only 47.6% from the free throw line, a trend which haunted the team the rest of the season.\nThe regular season home-opener was another victory for the team, as they defeated Nicholls State 85–62 on November 13. Early in the game, Melquan Bolding hit the floor on a hard foul during a breakaway. After a few minutes, he recovered and went on to lead the team with 25 points. Saunders scored 17 points with 19 rebounds, his first of a long streak of double-doubles. This game was also the second and final game of B.J. Monteiro's 2-game suspension following allegations of participating in a robbery. Three days later, it was announced that Bolding had fractured his wrist when he was fouled, and would be unable to play for 4–6 weeks.\nDespite the loss of Bolding, the team went on the road to face Iowa on November 17, with newly returned B.J. Monteiro starting in place of Melquan Bolding. When down 49–50 with 11.7 seconds left, Bill Clark took an off-balance 3-point shot which spun in, putting the team up 52–50 and sealing their second victory of the regular season. This was Duquesne's first ever victory at a Big Ten arena, and its first victory against a Big Ten school since a win over Illinois in 1973.\nThe CBE Classic.\nThe team then traveled to Cullowhee, North Carolina for three games as part of the O'Reilly Auto Parts CBE Classic. Duquesne defeated Binghamton 70–52 to extend its record to 3–0, with Saunders leading the way with 24 points. The next day the team improved to 4–0 with an overtime 75–72 victory against Division II Arkansas-Monticello. On the third day of play, Duquesne finally lost to Western Carolina, 77–83.\nThe City Game and Chuck Cooper Classic.\nThe Dukes then returned home, where they faced Radford on November 29. B.J. Monteiro continued to perform well as a starter in replacing Melquan Bolding, leading the team with 21 points. Next up for the team was the annual City Game match-up between Duquesne and its crosstown rival Pitt. In front of 12,336 fans at the Mellon Arena, Duquesne sprang out to a 16-point lead before slipping and losing 58–67 in double overtime. Bill Clark led all players with 23 points but the team hit foul trouble, with Saunders, Monteiro, and Peggau all fouling out in the final minutes.\nOn December 5, Duquesne hosted the Chuck Cooper Classic, in which it defeated the Savannah State Tigers by a score of 58–44. Eric Evans led with 17 points and Damian Saunders contributed 15.\nWest Virginia, Robert Morris, and Canisius.\nFour days later, the Dukes were blown out 39–68 by #7 West Virginia. Saunders led the team with only 12 points. One analyst attributed this loss to the skill of the Mountaineers, an abysmal night by star Bill Clark, as well as the continued absence of Melquan Bolding and now senior captain Jason Duty, who missed the game with a sprained ankle.\nOn December 12 the Dukes faced off against another local rival, Robert Morris. In a 59–54 win, B.J. Monteiro again led the team with 17 points. Monteiro's continued high level of play prompted some analysts, as well as fans, to wonder whether the approaching return of Melquan Bolding would send Monteiro back to the bench, or if someone else would lose their starting position. Four days later the Dukes held off the Canisius Golden Griffins in a double overtime 86–77 victory at home. Bill Clark and Damian Saunders both contributed double doubles while B.J. Monteiro scored a career high 27 points.\nThe end of non-conference play.\nThe team then traveled to Indianapolis, where they lost to IUPUI 64–73, despite a career high 20 points from Eric Evans. In their final game before a short Christmas break, Duquesne defeated the Saint Francis Red Flash 86–56. Damian Saunders scored his tenth double-double, making him the national leader in that statistic, as well as second in rebounds. Following the break, Duquesne lost its final non-conference game to the Old Dominion Monarchs by a score of 54–63, the first of a five-game losing streak. Saunders still managed to post his eleventh double-double, coming just one block short of what would have been only the second triple-double in school history.\nEarly conference play.\nDuquesne opened conference play on January 6 in a match against the Richmond Spiders, a team which the Dukes had not defeated since the Spiders joined the Atlantic 10 in 2001. This game marked the return of Melquan Bolding, though he did not start and scored only three points in fourteen minutes of playing time. Richmond managed to extend their streak, defeating the Dukes 86–80, while Saunders maintained his nation-leading position and now placed eighth in both blocks and steals. Duquesne then traveled to Dayton, Ohio where they lost to the Dayton Flyers 72–78 in overtime in front of a crowd of 13,435, the largest crowd the team would see all season. Senior Jason Duty was fouled on a 3-point attempt at the end of the game when his team was down by one, but made only one of three foul shots, sending the game into overtime. Melquan Bolding scored 13 points in 36 minutes, though he did not start, and Saunders came into the game now leading the nation in rebounds.\nDuquesne found itself in overtime once again as they dropped another game against the St. Louis Billikens in double overtime, 75–79. Melquan Bolding suffered another setback as he sat out most of the game, playing only five minutes due to strep throat. The team then went back out on the road to face the Rhode Island Rams, where they again lost with a final score of 67–75, dropping their conference record to 0–4. Bill Clark missed a game for the first time in his college career due to a suspension on suspicion of a \"secondary NCAA rules violation.\" Melquan Bolding started the game for the first time since his injury, but only scored 6 points.\nFirst conference win, Xavier, and Saint Joseph's.\nTwo days later, Clark was reinstated. With Clark back in the lineup for a home game against St. Bonaventure \"Bonnies\", Ron Everhart tried a new starting lineup: one that included Bolding and Monteiro, but left Senior Jason Duty on the bench. The Dukes took a 15-point lead at half time, but the Bonnies came back. With less than thirty seconds left, Bill Clark drew a charging penalty which gave his team the ball, down by two. One quick possession by each team left it 67–69 in favor of the Bonnies. On the final play, Damian Saunders drove towards the basket before passing it out to Melquan Bolding, who hit a 3-point shot to put the Dukes up by one with 3.5 seconds remaining. Duquesne won 70–69, giving them their first win since December 22.\nThe winning feeling was short-lived, however, as the Dukes were shut down by the Xavier Musketeers on January 28, losing 86–50. Melquan Bolding led the team with 14 points, Damian Saunders scored only 6, and Bill Clark only 4. On January 31 the team pulled out a 74–71 win against the Saint Joseph's Hawks at home, with Melquan Bolding leading the team with 24 points.\nTemple, George Washington, and Massachusetts.\nOnce again, though, the Dukes were unable to build momentum as they lost 60–76 to #19 ranked Temple. Bill Clark and Eric Evans led the team with just 12 points each. On February 6, the Dukes braved a blizzard for a game against the George Washington Colonials in Washington, D.C.. Saunders led the way to a 70–63 win with a career-high 27 points. Returning home on February 11 to face the Massachusetts Minutemen, the Dukes were unable to win two consecutive games for the third straight time, losing 80–84. Damian Saunders scored 15 points, but was injured and left the game for a while; when he returned, he did not score in the remainder of his playing time. He did, however, become Duquesne's 33rd player to pass the 1,000 career points mark.\nIntroducing the 10–40, Charlotte, and a rematch with Dayton.\nDuquesne enjoyed another game at home on February 14 against the La Salle Explorers. Ron Everhart sought a new strategy for his team, which was struggling in conference play. In this game, La Salle was missing three players, leaving them with an active roster of only eight players. Duquesne ran a 10–40 pattern, in which two squads of five players execute short, intense bursts before being switched out for the other squad. At first, Duquesne fell behind by 14 points, but the strategy paid off as La Salle's players tired. With La Salle fatigued, Duquesne switched back to a normal rotation and went on to win 103–82. Bill Clark scored a career high 34 points, and also surpassed the 1,000 point mark.\nAs underdogs on the road against the Charlotte 49ers, the Dukes' new 10–40 strategy led them to an 83–77 upset victory. This was the first time of the season the team had managed to win two consecutive conference games. On February 21, Duquesne again returned home for a nationally televised game against the Dayton Flyers. Senior Jason Duty was honored in a pre-game ceremony, and the game's attendance of 5,144 was only 214 short of the A.J. Palumbo Center's capacity. A late layup drive by Damian Saunders put the Dukes up by one, and they went on to win 73–71.\nEnding the regular season.\nDuquesne was unable to extend its streak on the road against St. Louis, as they lost 59–69. Bill Clark led the team with 17 points and Saunders grabbed four steals, enough to raise his per-game average to 2.9, a nation-leading figure. With this, Saunders had at one point led the nation in double-doubles, rebounds, and steals. The Dukes lost again, 80–92, in their final road game against Saint Bonaventure. The loss put a damper on Duquesne's hopes for a home game in the first round of the Atlantic 10 tournament, as they fell into a tie for the ninth seed position.\nDuquesne closed its season against Fordham, who had yet to win a conference game and had only won two games all season. Fordham was hungry for a win, and a lack of effective defense on both sides led to a high scoring 111–100 victory for Duquesne. Melquan Bolding and Eric Evans both posted career high scores of 32 and 23, respectively.\nPostseason.\nAfter Duquesne lost to Saint Bonaventure, the Bonnies also lost their final regular season game to Xavier, which left the two teams in a tie for the eighth seed and the home tournament game that went with it. The two teams had played each other twice during the season, with each team taking one victory, so the second tiebreaker came down to who had scored the best victory. Duquesne's best win came against Charlotte, while Saint Bonaventure's was against Rhode Island. Unfortunately, those two teams were also in a tie. So for Duquesne to get their home game, Charlotte had to win their final home game, and Rhode Island had to lose. Both teams lost, so the tie remained and Rhode Island won out due to their head-to-head records. Thus Duquesne would head back out on the road against the Bonnies.\nThe game was played on March 9 and was close until the Bonnies went on a 14–0 run halfway into the second half, going on to win 71–83. Despite Damian Saunders posting his 20th and final double-double of the year, Duquesne's 5 for 21 performance from beyond the 3-point arc combined with St. Bonaventure's 75% 3-point shooting and two players scoring in the upper twenties put the game out of the Dukes' reach. The loss dashed Duquesne's last hopes at a bid to the NIT. However, an invitation to either the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) or CollegeInsider.com Postseason Tournament was still possible.\nEarly on March 15, hours after the NCAA and NIT fields were announced, Duquesne accepted a bid into the CBI. This would be Duquesne's 23rd postseason appearance and first in the CBI, which started in 2008. This also marked the first time since 1981 that the Dukes made two consecutive postseason appearances. It was announced that the Dukes would face off against the Princeton Tigers at Jadwin Gymnasium on March 17.\nOn Tuesday, March 16, it was announced that Junior Bill Clark had been suspended indefinitely from the team due to \"conduct\" issues. Clark had not attended practice the day before and would not travel to Princeton with the team for the CBI opening game on Wednesday. This would be only the second game that Bill Clark has missed in his college career.\nDuquesne suffered its final disappointment of the season on March 17 as it fell to the Princeton Tigers. Bill Clark remained suspended and Damian Saunders led the team with only 14 points. Duquesne dominated the game early on, taking a 20–11 lead before Princeton came back, eventually leading 28–23 at the half. The Dukes were unable to turn the momentum and continued to fall behind, eventually losing 51–65. The absence of Bill Clark showed on defense, as the Dukes were out-rebounded heavily. The Dukes also failed to improve on their issues from the regular season, going only 8 for 18 from the free throw line and 3 for 15 from 3-point range. This loss ended the 2009 season, and all Duquesne could do was look ahead to the next year.\nSchedule.\n!colspan=9| 2010 Atlantic 10 men's basketball tournament\n!colspan=9| 2010 College Basketball Invitational\nStatistics.\nDuquesne was plagued by a few issues during the 2009 season. Most notable were the poor free-throw and 3-point shooting percentages. Duquesne was last in the Atlantic 10 in both of these categories at 60.8% and 26.3% respectively. Despite their poor performance shooting from beyond the 3-point line, Duquesne still shot the fourth most three-pointers of all teams in the Atlantic 10. The following chart displays player per-game average statistics for the regular season and Atlantic 10 tournament.\nSource\nAwards and controversies.\nDuquesne players received a few accolades in the 2009–10 season. Junior Damian Saunders's outstanding play earned him a spot on the Atlantic 10 All-Conference First Team. He was also named the Atlantic 10 Defensive Player of the Year. Earlier in the season, Jason Duty was nominated as a finalist for the Lowe's Senior CLASS award, an award which recognizes college seniors who demonstrate exemplary outstanding performance both on the court and in the classroom. Duty, who held a 3.72 GPA as an accounting major and had already accepted a job with PricewaterhouseCoopers, was named to the Atlantic 10 All-Academic Team.\nEarly in the season, Damian Saunders was named Atlantic 10 (A-10) player of the week for two consecutive weeks, sharing the honors with Chris Wright of Dayton and Jordan Crawford of Xavier, respectively. Following his 34-point performance against La Salle, Bill Clark earned his first career A-10 Player of the Week award, with Richmond's Kevin Anderson.\nThe season was also marred by a few controversies. Prior to the beginning of play, B.J. Monteiro was arrested on October 3 in Middletown, Connecticut. He turned himself into police on suspicion of participating in the theft of a laptop, iPod, and cash from a house during a party in early August. He was charged with third-degree larceny and, on October 6, he was suspended indefinitely from the team. Following his court appearance on October 13, all charges were dropped and Monteiro was reinstated to the team.\nIn late January, Junior Bill Clark was benched for the game against Rhode Island as the NCAA investigated a potential secondary rules violation. The specific details of the incident were not released by Duquesne, even after Clark's return to the team the next day. A secondary rules violation is defined as \"one that is isolated or inadvertent in nature, provides or is intended to provide only a minimal recruiting, competitive or other advantage.\"\nIn the postseason, Bill Clark was again suspended, this time by coach Everhart for a conduct issue. The day before the CBI game against Princeton, Everhart announced that Clark would not travel to the game or participate in any practices or team activities until he felt the student ready to return. Clark was reinstated two weeks later, and, as before, no details were revealed."

        "text": "Hooker is one of the positions in a rugby league football team. Usually wearing jersey or shirt number 9, the hooker is one of the team's forwards. During scrums the hooker plays in the front row, and the position's name comes from their role of 'hooking' or 'raking' the ball back with the foot. For this reason the hooker is sometimes referred to in Australia as the rake.\nHookers have a great deal of contact with the ball, as they usually play the role of acting halfback or dummy half, picking the ball up from the play-the-ball that follows a tackle. Hookers therefore have much responsibility in that they then decide what to do with the ball, whether that be to pass it (and to whom), run with it, or occasionally to kick it. Therefore, together with the two halves and , hooker is one of the four key positions that make up what is sometimes called a team's 'spine'. A trend of halves converting into hookers followed the introduction of the 10 metre rule, and many players have switched between these positions in their careers such as Geoff Toovey, Andrew Johns, Craig Gower and Peter Wallace.\nThe laws of rugby league state that the hooker is to be numbered 9. However, in some leagues, such as Super League, players can wear shirt numbers which do not have to conform to this system.\nOne book published in 1996 stated that in senior rugby league, the hooker and handled the ball more often than any other position. In the 2013 NRL season the top six players with the most tackles were all hookers.\nNotable hookers.\nHookers that feature in their nations' rugby league halls of fame are New Zealand's Jock Butterfield and Australia's Ken Kearney, Sandy Pearce, Cameron Smith and Noel Kelly. The most-capped British international hooker was Wales' Tommy Harris."

        "text": "Jeffrey Jackson (born January 2, 1972) is an American former professional baseball player who won the Gatorade High School Baseball Player of the Year Award in 1989. He later played in minor league baseball for nine seasons.\nDraft and professional career.\nJackson was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies in the first round (fourth overall) of the 1989 Major League Baseball Draft out of Simeon Career Academy. He began his professional career that season, hitting .227 in 48 games for the Martinsville Phillies. \nJust after his high school graduation, the 17-year-old relocated from Chicago to live with a couple in Martinsville, Virginia, and described feeling culture shock and isolation, spending his days alone in the house, without a driver's license, before heading to the baseball stadium in the afternoons. Jackson was hitting over .500 in his senior year of high school, in contrast to his underperformance in his first year as a professional baseball player, which could account for some of the negative press he received, with one journalist even suggesting the nickname \"Clueless Jeff Jackson.\" Still, the Phillies seemed hopeful that the young player would improve.\nIn 1990, he hit .198 in 63 games with the Batavia Clippers, and in 1991 he hit .225 in 121 games with the Spartanburg Phillies.\nHe split 1992 between the Clearwater Phillies (79 games) and Reading Phillies (36 games), hitting a combined .227 in 115 games. He spent all of 1993 and 1994 with Reading, hitting .238 in 113 games in 1993 and .177 in 47 games in 1994.\nThis was the year that the Phillies finally gave up on Jackson. Reporter Ron Kohl suggested that the organization's years-long commitment to Jackson may have been related to his large signing bonus, which was reportedly $180,000.\nHe did not play in 1995. In 1996, Jackson returned to organized baseball, playing for the Will County Cheetahs of the independent Heartland League and for the Daytona Cubs in the Chicago Cubs organization. He hit .300 in 26 games overall. In 1997, he played for the Cheetahs again, hitting .303 with 13 home runs in 64 games.\nIn 1998, Jackson spent 26 games with the Lynchburg Hillcats in the Pittsburgh Pirates system, as well as 15 games with the Fargo-Moorhead RedHawks of the independent Northern League and 26 games with the Massachusetts Mad Dogs of the independent Northeast League. He hit a combined .227 in 69 games. 1998 was his final season.\nOverall, Jackson hit .234 in 666 minor league games.\nPost-baseball career.\nAfter the end of his baseball career, Jackson moved to California, where he started a consulting business. He also had a business called First Round Sports and Entertainment Agency. He published a book with co-author Dana Jones, \"The Gift and the Curse: The Jeff Jackson Story\". "

        "text": "David Sills V (born May 29, 1996) is an American football wide receiver for the Denver Broncos of the National Football League (NFL). \nAs a seventh-grade quarterback in 2010, he garnered national attention when he verbally committed to play football at the University of Southern California. In 2014, Sills decommitted from USC and eventually signed a national letter of intent to play at West Virginia University. Sills began his college career as a quarterback, but moved to wide receiver as a freshman. After spending his freshman year playing for the West Virginia Mountaineers, Sills transferred to El Camino College, but transferred back to West Virginia in 2017. He led the nation that season in touchdown receptions and was a first-team 2017 College Football All-America Team selection by \"Sporting News\", \"Sports Illustrated\" and CBS Sports for the 2017 West Virginia Mountaineers. He led the 2018 Big 12 Conference in touchdowns and was named 2018 All-Big 12 Conference football team first-team selection as well as a Second-team 2018 College Football All-American by the Walter Camp Football Foundation and American Football Coaches Association.\nEarly years.\nSills was born in 1996. His parents are Denise and David Sills IV. He has two older sisters, Emma and Abby. His father is a commercial developer and contractor, who played cornerback for the Virginia Military Institute. He began playing youth football at age six and began training at age nine with quarterback trainer Steve Clarkson.\nLane Kiffin offered Sills a scholarship to play college football at USC in 2010. Sills gave USC a non-binding verbal commitment in 2010. Sills was among the youngest football players to receive a scholarship offer from a major football program.\nAs a high school freshman, Sills was the starting quarterback for Red Lion Christian Academy, a private Delaware school for grades K-12. \"Sports Illustrated\" hailed him as one of the greatest prospects ever, and \"Bloomberg News\" described him as the \"best arm money can buy\". At Red Lion in 2010, he accumulated 1,355 passing yards and nine touchdowns against five interceptions in eight games. In 2011, he totalled 2,340 yards and 28 touchdowns in what was his second year as a varsity quarterback. He was named a MaxPreps.com U.S. Air Force second-team freshman All-American.\nAs a sophomore, Sills became the quarterback for Eastern Christian Academy (ECA) of Elkton, Maryland. The move was controversial because the school was a newly-formed online school. All enrolled boys were on the 46-man football team established by David Sills IV to showcase their talents to college scouts. Eastern Christian Academy was only able to play in three games in 2012 due to the school's failure to gain accreditation from the state. As a junior, Sills injured his knuckle and his delivery was impacted forever. \nLane Kiffin, who had originally offered Sills a scholarship back in 2010, was fired by USC in 2013. He was replaced by Ed Orgeron on an interim basis. Eventually, USC would hire Steve Sarkisian to become the new head coach. According to Sills' father, Sarkisian told his son that USC would honor their scholarship offer. While receiving reassurance from Sarkisian, the Sillses got the feeling that David wasn't USC's first option. USC had offered and eventually signed two highly ranked quarterbacks in the same class, Sam Darnold and Ricky Town. Sills decommitted from USC in June 2014.\nCollege career.\nWest Virginia.\nOn July 16, 2014, Sills announced his commitment to West Virginia University via Twitter. Sills was one of West Virginia's early enrollees from the 2015 recruiting class. As a result, he was able to participate in spring practice. He battled fellow quarterbacks Skyler Howard, William Crest Jr. and Chris Chugunov for the starting quarterback spot. Howard was eventually named the starting quarterback. Sills earned playing time as a wide receiver after impressing coaches with his performance on the scout team. On October 17, 2015, Sills made his collegiate debut against the Baylor Bears. He finished the game with two receptions for 64 yards. His second collegiate reception was a 35-yard touchdown. He made the game-winning touchdown reception in the 2016 Cactus Bowl against Arizona State and ended the season with seven receptions for 131 yards.\nDuring spring drills in 2016, Sills split time between quarterback and wide receiver. After West Virginia's 2016 spring game, West Virginia head coach Dana Holgorsen stated that Howard solidified his position as the starting quarterback and that Crest and Chugunov would continue to battle for the backup quarterback spot. With several quarterbacks ahead of him on the depth chart and former Florida starting quarterback Will Grier scheduled to become eligible to play for the Mountaineers in 2017, it appeared unlikely Sills would ever get an opportunity to play quarterback at West Virginia.\nEl Camino College.\nOn June 23, 2016, Sills announced he would transfer to El Camino College. He spent seven months on the couch of high school friend Khaliel Rodgers who was on the USC roster as an offensive lineman at the time. In his lone season playing for the Warriors, Sills played quarterback and threw for 1,636 yards and 15 touchdowns.\nReturn to West Virginia.\nOn December 15, 2016, West Virginia football announced on Twitter that Sills would be returning to West Virginia. In West Virginia's 2017 spring game, Sills lined up at wide receiver and caught six passes for 98 yards from Will Grier. In the September 3 season opener for the 2017 West Virginia Mountaineers against the 21st-ranked Virginia Tech Hokies Sills posted nine receptions for 94 yards and two touchdowns in a losing effort against the Hokies. On September 9, Sills posted seven catches for a career-high 153 yards and a career-high three touchdowns against East Carolina. He then tallied 130 yards and two touchdowns against Kansas on September 23. Following the Kansas game and a bye week Sills was tied for the national lead in touchdown receptions with seven in his first four games and then he added two touchdown receptions on October 7 against TCU, bringing his total to nine. Sills added three more touchdown receptions on October 14 against Texas Tech extending his national lead. Sills' three receiving touchdowns on October 21 in a 38–36 victory over Baylor gave sills a total of 15 for the season, which continued to lead the nation. Sills made his 17th and 18th touchdown catches of the season on November 11 against Kansas State. However, in the following game, starting quarterback Grier was lost for the season, and Sills finished the season with 18 touchdowns.\nAs a junior, Sills received numerous honors. On November 13, he was one of three 2017 Big 12 Conference football wide receivers named as a semifinalist for the Biletnikoff Award (along with James Washington and Keke Coutee). A week later he was named as one of three finalists for the award (along with Washington and Michael Gallup). On November 30, Sills was the only member of the 2017 West Virginia Mountaineers football team named to the 2017 All-Big 12 Conference football first team. Sills finished the season as the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision touchdown receptions leader with 18 (tied with Anthony Miller). Sills earned 2017 College Football All-America Team first-team recognition from \"Sports Illustrated\", \"Sporting News\" and CBS Sports. Sills also earned several second-team All-American honors, including Associated Press, Walter Camp Football Foundation, SB Nation, \"College Football News\", and American Football Coaches Association. Sills decided to return to play his senior season with Grier.\nSills entered the season on watchlists for the Maxwell Award, Fred Biletnikoff Award, and Walter Camp Award. With Grier back for their senior seasons, Sills opened up the season with a seven-catch, 140-yard, two-touchdown effort in a victory over Tennessee. The Mountaineers schedule was cut short one game when Hurricane Florence caused a cancellation of the September 15 game at NC State. On September 22, Sills tallied three touchdowns against Kansas State. Sills also had 2-touchdown performances against Baylor (139 yards) on October 25, Texas on November 3, and Oklahoma (131 yards) on November 23. Sills' 15 touchdowns led the Big 12. Following the season, he was a 2018 All-Big 12 Conference football team first-team selection. Sills earned 2018 College Football All-America Team second-team recognition by the Walter Camp Football Foundation and, American Football Coaches Association. He earned third-team recognition from the Associated Press.\nProfessional career.\nBuffalo Bills.\nSills signed with the Buffalo Bills as an undrafted free agent on April 27, 2019. He was waived by the Bills on August 31, 2019.\nNew York Giants.\nOn September 1, 2019, Sills was signed to the practice squad of the New York Giants. On December 17, 2019, Sills was promoted to the active roster. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the Giants on July 28, 2020, and activated from the list seven days later. On September 4, 2020, Sills was placed on the injured reserve list after fracturing his foot during training camp. He was placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list by the team on December 30, 2020, and moved back to injured reserve on January 7, 2021. He signed a contract extension with the team on January 7 thru the 2021 season.\nOn August 31, 2021, Sills was waived by the Giants and re-signed to the practice squad the next day.

He was released on December 31, 2022. He re-signed with the team’s practice squad on January 3, 2023. He signed a reserve/future contract on January 26, 2023. He was waived as part of final roster cuts on August 29, 2023.\nDenver Broncos.\nOn August 31, 2023, Sills was signed to the Denver Broncos practice squad.

An Australian syndicate headed by Sir Frank Packer, representing the Royal Sydney Yacht Squadron, challenged with their yacht \"Gretel.\" Although the New York Yacht Club won the regatta four races to one represented by the yacht \"Weatherly,\" the challenger, \"Gretel\" won the second race, beating the Americans for the first time since the 1930s, and only lost the fourth race by twenty-six seconds.

        "text": "The 2010 Kentucky Derby was the 136th running of the Kentucky Derby. The race took place on May 1, 2010, and was televised in the United States on the NBC television network. The post time was EDT ( UTC). The stakes of the race were US$2,185,200. The race was sponsored by Yum! Brands and hence officially was called Kentucky Derby Presented by Yum! Brands.\nSuper Saver won the race with Calvin Borel as jockey. Borel became the first jockey to win three Kentucky Derby titles in a four-year span. Ice Box, Paddy O'Prado and Make Music for Me finished second, third and fourth, respectively. Attendance was listed at 155,804, making it the sixth-largest in Derby history. Total betting exceeded US$ for the main pool, and for the exacta.\nThe field.\nAfter early favorite Eskendereya was withdrawn due to a swollen leg the week prior to the 2010 Kentucky Derby, the field was left with no clear favorite. Lookin At Lucky was the race-time favorite based on his strong form at age two (Del Mar Futurity, Norfolk Stakes and CashCall Futurity), but only at odds of 6–1 against victory. Those odds tied the highest odds for a favorite in the history of the Derby. Super Saver, who had won the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes at two and finished second in the Arkansas Derby, went off at odds of 8–1. Post positions were drawn Thursday, April 29, 2010.\nResults.\nIn what was considered \"the most wide-open Derby in years\", Super Saver hit the lead at the top of the stretch and held on to win the 136th Kentucky Derby. Jockey Calvin Borel captured his third Derby win in the last four years, while trainer Todd Pletcher picked up his first Derby victory in 25 tries. \nThe track was wet and sloppy due to rain the previous night and nearly all day on Derby Day. After a windy, rain-soaked day at Churchill Downs, the sun came out just shortly before race time. The winning time was 2:04.45, and the margin of victory was listed as lengths. Trained by Nick Zito, Ice Box came from well back in the pack to narrowly beat Paddy O'Prado for second place.\nSuper Saver started the day as the second favorite behind Lookin At Lucky. Coming out of the No. 4 gate, Borel immediately broke towards the inside rail, a strategy he often employs. He then pulled the horse back, rounding the final turn in fourth place, and charged to victory along the rail, holding off the impressive late charge from Ice Box on the sloppy track. It was the horse's first victory since winning the Kentucky Jockey Club Stakes as a two-year-old. Pre-race favorite Lookin At Lucky was hampered by drawing the No. 1 post. He was pinned on the rail early and did not get adequate running room until it was too late, finishing sixth.\nExotic wager.\nBrian Palmer used the \"successful $1 bet on the superfecta\" in the 2010 Kentucky Derby that \"paid a whopping $101,284.60\" as an example of the controversial high-risk, high-payout exotic bets that were observed by track-watchers since the 1970s. Palmer compared these horse racing bets to the controversial emerging exotic financial instruments that concerned then-chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker in 1980. He argued that just as the exotic wagers survived the media controversy so will the exotic options.\nSubsequent Grade I wins.\nAlthough Super Saver never won another race, several entries recorded subsequent Grade I wins:\nSubsequent breeding careers.\nLeading progeny of participants in the 2010 Kentucky Derby are as follows:\nLookin at Lucky (6th)\nSuper Saver (1st)\nSources: American Classic Pedigrees, Equibase, Blood-Horse Stallion Register"

Kazakhstan took the third-most gold medals with seven, while the hosts (South Korea) won 18 medals to be the third-best medalling team, although this was one of their weaker sports.\nIn terms of athletes, Minori Hayakari provided a boost to Japan by winning silver in the 800 metres and a bronze in the 1500 metres event. Wang Zhicheng of China also won two individual medals: a 5000 metres silver, and 10,000 metres bronze.

The term generally refers to all triathlon events with a distance that is a multiple of the Ironman Triathlon, which consists of of swimming, of cycling, and a full marathon () of running. The most common distances are the double, triple, quadruple, quintuple and deca triathlon. Unlike a standard triathlon event, an ultra-triathlon event may not necessarily involve the three component disciplines of triathlon (swimming, cycling and running) in direct consecutive order, but may instead consist of multiple consecutive individual triathlons performed on consecutive days, or may involve disciplines out of the usual order, such as the Enduroman that goes run-swim-bike to allow crossing of the English Channel.\nThe first ultra-distance race was held as a double in Huntsville, Alabama (USA) in 1985, and since then the distances have been expanding. While 20x and even 30x events have been held, the DECA, or 10x event, either in the 'continuous' version (swim-bike-run), or in the 'one-per-day' version is typically the longest distance that can be found on the race calendar every year. In 2020 and 2022, the swissultra DECA continuous was the IUTA World Championship over that distance.\nThe IUTA (International Ultra Triathlon Association) is the official governing body of Ultra Triathlon."

It was originally for air force pilots to train, but later opened up to civilians. The Ski Federation of Pakistan was founded in 1990. The 2010 Olympic Games was Pakistan's debut at the Winter Olympics.

He trained for two weeks in 2008 and six weeks in Austria in 2009, training under an Austrian coach. The slope he trains on in Pakistan is about 500 meters long, with a 100 meter elevation change. The Olympics were his first competition of 2010, since he did not have money to compete in other contests. The Ski Federation of Pakistan considered spending approximately $7000 on his training, but decided to save that money for future skiers.\nThe event was supposed to start on February 21, but was postponed two days to allow for the men's super combined to take place. Abbas finished the first run in 1:38.27, placing 87th on that run. On his second run, he completed the event in 1:42.31 in 79th place. His total time was 3:20.58, for 79th place overall, out of 81 competitors that finished the event."

        "text": "Adaptive Sailing Association of British Columbia (ASABC), formerly called the Disabled Sailing Association, is a Canadian not-for-profit organization that enables people with disabilities to take part in a sport it promotes as \"accessible and inclusive.\" It is located in Vancouver, BC, and has affiliated branches in Victoria, Chemainus and Kelowna.\nPrograms.\nASABC operates a fleet of eight specially designed Martin 16 sailboats from the Jericho Sailing Centre. These are designed to enable people with all levels of disability to enjoy sailing as a recreation activity or competitive high performance endeavor.\nPeople with high-level disabilities, such as quadriplegia, have complete control of the vessel using sip-and-puff technology, with many sailing solo.\nEach sailing season, ASABC reports that it hosts between 800 and 1,000 sailing experiences at Jericho and more from its affiliated branches. This ranges from leisure sailing to competitive racing.\nThe organization states sailing \"promotes freedom and independence\" for people with disabilities through the opportunity to take part in an exciting and challenging outdoor sport.\nHistory.\nSam Sullivan, a quadriplegic, founded ASABC in 1989, using a British-made Sunbird dinghy. British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher had originally presented the boat to Rick Hansen during Expo '86 in Vancouver, celebrating his \"Man in Motion\" world tour. Hansen subsequently presented the boat to Sullivan in order that people with disabilities could benefit from it.\nDuring its first summer, people with a range of disabilities logged a total of 22 sails. The major breakthrough for the sport came in 1993 with the addition of (mouth-operated) sip n’ puff controls, which are connected to a power assist system. This enabled people with little or no arm movement to sail.\nIn 1995, the successor to the Sunbird was developed by Vancouver yacht designer Don Martin. The Martin 16 can be controlled conventionally, or by joystick, or through the sip n’ puff interface.\nEquipment.\nASABC initially used the Sunbird, to which it added Sip n’ Puff controls in 1993.\nHowever, the Sunbird's limitations could not be ignored, so Sullivan commissioned a new boat designed specifically for adaptive sailing. When Vancouver's Don Martin designed the Martin 16 in 1995, he included the requirements of power-assisted controls into his design brief.\nThe weighted keel makes it a very safe and stable boat, but it is also responsive. The addition of a portable, modular sip n’ puff system in 1998 – which can be dropped into a boat when needed – adds to the versatility of the vessel.\nAffiliated societies.\nThe Sam Sullivan Disability Foundation consists of six affiliated societies:"

The program is classified in the NCAA Division I, and the team competes in the Big 12 Conference. Kansas State's volleyball team began competition in 1974. Jason Mansfield has served as head coach since the start of the 2023 season.\nHistory.\nWhile the program was moderately successful through much of their early years, finishing with just over a .500 winning percentage in the 1970s, Kansas State Volleyball struggled throughout much of the 1980s and early 1990s, not making a single NCAA tournament appearance or finishing with an above .500 record in Big Eight play. From 1991 to 1993, the program only won one game in conference play (coming in 1991), finishing 0–12 both in 1992 and 1993.\nThe program direction started to change however, with the hiring of Jim Moore in 1994. While only modestly improving to 3–9 in Big Eight play in his first year, the Wildcats won 21 games in 1995, and finished 1996 with 26 wins, and tied for fourth in the newly minted Big 12 Conference. 1996 also marked the program's first ever berth into the NCAA women's volleyball tournament, where they defeated Cal State Northridge in the first round before losing to Washington State in the Second round. While Moore left the program before the 1997 season for Big 12 Rival University of Texas, his tenure marked a tremendous turnaround for the program.\nJim McLaughlin followed Jim Moore in the 1997 season, leading the program to four more consecutive NCAA Tournament berths during each year of his tenure, including their first ever NCAA Sweet Sixteen berth in the 2000 season. His time as head coach of the program marked a period of continued success for the Wildcats.\n2013 World University games.\nThe Kansas State volleyball team served as the U.S. national squad at the 2013 Summer Universiade in Russia. The team posted a 1–5 record at the tournament.\nCoaches' history.\nAll-Time coaches:"

        "title": "Golf Association of Philadelphia",
        "text": "The Golf Association of Philadelphia is the oldest regional Golf Association in the United States. Better known as the GAP, the Golf Association of Philadelphia was founded in 1897 by members of Aronimink Golf Club, Merion Cricket Club, Philadelphia Country Club and Philadelphia Cricket Club. Its 150 member clubs are spread across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware. The purpose of the association is simple: to preserve, protect and promote the game of golf.\nHistory.\n1894 meeting.\nOn December 22, 1894, delegates from five clubs – St. Andrews Golf Club, Shinnecock Hills Golf Club, Newport Golf Club, The Country Club (Brookline, Massachusetts), and Chicago Golf Club – met at the Calumet Club in Manhattan to form the Amateur Golf Association of the United States (subsequently to change its name, first to The American Golf Association, then to the United States Golf Association). Less than a month afterwards the Essex Country Club and the Philadelphia Country Club were elected to membership, the sixth and seventh on the roll.\nGAP founded.\nA little more than two years later, the Golf Association of Philadelphia was founded. It was America's first regional golf association. Once again the Devon Golf Club served as a spur. For it was on this organization's course that the first interclub team match in the Philadelphia area was played. On Oct. 15, 1896 a team representing Philadelphia Cricket Club squared off against Devon's top players. The Cricket Club won 22 to 12. The occasion was so thoroughly enjoyable (even the losers had a grand time!) that the appeal of interclub matches on a broader scale was discussed and embraced. The obvious outgrowth of such thinking was the formation of an association of local golf clubs to organize and administer these competitions.\nOn Feb. 5, 1897, seven men gathered at the Market Street National Bank for the express purpose of founding the Golf Association of Philadelphia. Representing the Belmont Golf Association (soon to be reorganized into the Aronimink Golf Club) were Milton C. Work and Dr. Henry Toulmin. From Merion Cricket Club came Rodman E. Griscom and Walter E. Stephenson. Philadelphia Country Club's delegates were George D. Fowle and Isaac T. Starr. Samuel Y. Heebner alone represented Philadelphia Cricket Club, Alan H. Harris being unavoidably absent.\nObjectives and membership.\nThe objective of the fledgling association was simplicity itself: to promote interest in the game of golf and to regulate all competitions between member clubs. In order to join the Association, a club had to be formally organized, have at least nine holes of golf for its exclusive use, and belong to the United States Golf Association. At the outset four clubs - the four founding clubs - were named Associate Members of the Golf Association of Philadelphia. Most clubs which would follow were accepted into the association as Allied Members. The difference was significant: Associate Member clubs had the right to be represented at the annual meeting by two delegates, each with one vote. Allied Members, on the other hand, could send only one delegate to the meeting and he has no vote. Moreover, the Association's three officers - president, vice-president, and secretary-treasurer - could be elected from the rosters of Associate Member clubs. The same was true of the other two members of the executive committee.\nThe annual dues were $25 for Associate Member clubs, $10 for Allied Members, the bargain rate doubtless a reflection of the latter category's powerless position in the scheme of things. With the passing of the years, this distinction between the two classes of membership would blur and finally, with a revision of the by-laws, be eliminated.\nFirst elections.\nAt an organizational meeting two months later, on April 5, 1897, George D. Fowle, Philadelphia Country Club, was elected the first president of the Golf Association of Philadelphia. Dr. Henry Toulmin, Belmont, was elected vice president, and Alan Harris, of the Cricket Club, secretary-treasurer. Named to join these three on the then five-man Executive Committee (it would become a seven-member body in 1901) were Samuel Heebner, of the Cricket Club, and Louis A. Biddle, of the Country Club and Merion.\nFirst matches.\nOnce the officers and executive committee were in place, little time was lost in launching the first interclub team matches. That year the Association's four founding clubs each fielded two teams, six players per team, for a total of 48 players in the \"league.\" Matches were played in both spring and fall. When the final tally for the year was in, Merion's 1st team and the Cricket Club's 2nd team were the winners. The only other competition in the Golf Association's first season was what was then called the Individual Championship Tournament, today known as the Philadelphia Amateur Championship.\nGAP Team Matches.\nThe GAP Team Matches, originally known as the Interclub Matches, served as the basis for the founding of the Association in 1897. Teams compete in a four-team sectional round-robin format (which equates to three matches in three weeks). A total of 12 players per team compete with six players staying home and six traveling to the opponent's club. Clubs are divided and placed in Divisions AA through F based on the previous year's results. Playoff and Challenges determined the top divisions’ clubs. It is believed that the GAP Team Matches are the single-largest golfing team competition in the country.\nTournaments.\nThe Golf Association of Philadelphia conducts over 60 tournaments annually from April to October. The schedule features events available for players of all ages (Junior, Amateur and Senior) and skill level (championship and handicap). It also includes the Association's four Majors: the Middle-Amateur Championship, Amateur Championship, Open Championship and Joseph H. Patterson Cup. At the season's conclusion, GAP awards “Player of the Year” honors on four levels: Amateur, Junior, Senior and Super-Senior. It also acknowledges a Junior Sportsman of the Year, Volunteer of the Year and Distinguished Service Award recipient."

        "text": "The 1994 Winter Olympics were held in and around Lillehammer, Norway, from 12 to 27 February 1994. Ten competition and fourteen non-competition venues were used, most of which were subsequently used for the 1994 Winter Paralympics. The Games were spread out over ten venues in five municipalities in two counties, Oppland and Hedmark. Lillehammer, with approximately 25,000 inhabitants, and Hamar and Gjøvik, both with approximately 27,000 inhabitants, are all situated on the lake Mjøsa. Gjøvik and Hamar are south of Lillehammer, respectively. Hunderfossen is north of Lillehammer, but located within the municipality. Øyer and Ringebu, each with just under 5,000 inhabitants, are north of Lillehammer, respectively, in the valley Gudbrandsdalen. Lillehammer had four competition venues, Hamar had two competition venues, while Hunderfossen, Gjøvik, Øyer and Ringebu had one competition venue each.\nIn Lillehammer, Lysgårdsbakkene Ski Jumping Arena features twin ski jumping hills. The large hill has a hill size of 138 and a K-point of 120, while the normal hill has a hill size of 100 and a critical point of 90. The hill has capacity for 35,000 spectators and hosted, in addition to the ski jumping events, the opening and closing ceremonies. Birkebeineren Ski Stadium featured cross-country skiing and biathlon, with the stadium itself having a capacity for 31,000 spectators during cross-country skiing and 13,500 during biathlon. In addition, spectators could watch from along the tracks. For the cross-country men's 4 × 10 km relay, over 203,000 people applied for the 31,000 seats. Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena featured a capacity for 15,000 spectators. All the outdoor skiing arenas had free areas, which saw up to 25,000 extra spectators at the team jump and 75,000 extra spectators at the 50 km.\nLillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track is located at Hunderfossen. It had a capacity for 10,000 spectators and is the only bobsleigh and luge track in the Nordic countries. Ice hockey was played at two venues: Håkon Hall in Lillehammer and Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall in Gjøvik. Håkon Hall has a capacity for 10,500 spectators, and also features the Norwegian Olympic Museum. The Cavern Hall is built as a man-made cave and had a capacity for 5,300 spectators. Skating events took place at two venues in Hamar. Hamar Olympic Hall had a capacity for 10,600 spectators and featured speed skating events, while figure skating and short track speed skating was held at Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre. Alpine skiing was split between two ski resorts: Hafjell in Øyer and Kvitfjell in Ringebu. The former was used for the slalom and giant slalom, while the latter hosted downhill and super-G.\nAthlete and leader accommodation was provided for 2,300 people at Lillehammer Olympic Village, which was located at Skårsetlia. Toneheim Folk High School's dormitories and surrounding areas, named Hamar Olympic Subsite Village, hosted 500 athletes. Media accommodation was split between five locations, two in Lillehammer, two in Øyer and one in Hamar. The main working accommodation for the media was the International Broadcast Center and the Main Press Center, both located at Storhove in Lillehammer. Lillehammer Art Museum and Maihaugen where the official culture venues, with the latter hosting the 102nd IOC Session.\nVenue construction ran from spring 1990 to December 1993. All the competition and most of the non-competition venues were purpose-built for the Games. For the first time in Olympic history, environmental and sustainability issues were considered in venue construction. This resulted in five venues being modified during their design and construction phase to lessen their impact upon the environment. Among the issues considered were the venues blending into surrounding landscape, treatment of terrain with as minimal damage to natural surroundings as possible, use of environmentally-friendly materials, and environmental auditing. Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall was constructed inside a mountain that maintained a year-round temperature of , with the excavated rock used to build a beach promenade. Transport was dominated by the use of buses and trains for spectators. Downtown Lillehammer and the axis between Lillehammer and Oslo were the most congested areas, and the Norwegian State Railways ran up to 22 trains per day between Oslo and Lillehammer. All venues could be reached within walking distance from train stations.\nCompetition venues.\nThe following list contains the ten venues used for competitions during the 1994 Winter Olympics. They are listed by their name during the Games, as well as containing the sports held at the venue, the municipality where they are located, the spectator capacity, and the cost of constructing the venue in millions of Norwegian krone (MNOK).\nNon-competition venues.\nThe following list contains the fourteen non-competition venues used during the 1994 Winter Olympics. They are listed with their function, location, capacity, size in square meters and square feet, and the cost of construction, in millions of Norwegian krone (MNOK). For existing structures, the cost indicates what was used to upgrade them ahead of the Games.\nPost-Olympic use.\nHamar Olympic Hall hosted the World Allround Speed Skating Championships for Men and the UCI Track Cycling World Championships in 1993. Following the Games, it has hosted the World Allround Speed Skating World Championships in 1999, 2004 and 2009. The venue also hosted the World Sprint Speed Skating Championships in 1997, 2002 and 2007, and the World Single Distance Championships in 1996.\nLillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track hosted the skeleton part of the FIBT World Championships in 1995, as well as the FIL World Luge Championships in 1995. Birkebeineren hosted its last Biathlon World Cup event in 1997, and its last cross-country skiing World Cup event was in March 2002. The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup has been hosted in Lillehammer on various occasions, most recently in December 2010. Lysgårdsbakken has served as part of the Nordic Tournament from 2004 through 2006 and from 2008 through 2009. Håkon Hall and Gjøvik played host to the World Women's Handball Championship in 1999, while the 1999 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships used Håkon Hall and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre.\nThe sports venues were taken over by the respective municipalities. The Lillehammer venues are owned by the municipal Lillehammer Olympiapark, while similar companies were created for Hamar and Gjøvik. The International Broadcast Center was built as a future campus for Lillehammer University College. The Main Press Center was converted to a business park. Only part of the athlete accommodation was built for permanent use, and was sold as regular housing after the Games. The rest was built as mobile units and sold to other parts of the country. Similarly, the media accommodation was built as a mix of permanent and temporary housing, with the latter being sold as cottages after the Games were completed."

        "text": "The 2014 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXII Olympic Winter Games, were a winter multi-sport event held in Sochi, Russia, from 7 to 23 February. A total of 2,873 athletes from 88 nations participated in 98 events in 7 sports across 15 different disciplines. \nInitially, host nation Russia matched the Soviet Union's 1976 achievement of thirteen gold medals, but 4 gold, 8 silver and 1 bronze medals were stripped due to doping. However, later the Court of Arbitration for Sport reinstated 2 gold, 7 silver and 1 bronze medals.\nThe Netherlands achieved four podium sweeps in the speed skating, dominating the men's 500 metres, men's 5,000 metres, men's 10,000 metres, and women's 1,500 metres, surpassing the previous record of two podium sweeps. Slovenia won its first Winter Olympics gold medal ever, in alpine skiing. This was also the first Winter Olympic gold medal tie. Latvia won its first Olympic gold medal due to medals reallocation after the IOC retested doping samples in November 2017. Luger Armin Zöggeler of Italy became the first athlete to achieve six Winter Olympic medals over six consecutive games, all achieved at the men's singles event. Speed skater Ireen Wüst from the Netherlands achieved five medals (two gold and three silver), more than any other athlete. South Korean-born Russian short track speed skater Viktor Ahn, Norwegian cross-country skier Marit Bjørgen, and Belarusian biathlete Darya Domracheva tied for the most gold medals, with three each.\nMedal table.\nThe medal table is based on information provided by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and is consistent with IOC convention in its published medal tables. By default, the table is ordered by the number of gold medals the athletes from a nation have won, where nation is an entity represented by a National Olympic Committee (NOC). The number of silver medals is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze medals. \nIn the women's downhill event in alpine skiing two gold medals were awarded for a first place tie, no silver medal was awarded for the event. In the men's super-G alpine skiing, two bronze medals were awarded for a third place tie.\n Changes in medal standings (see below)\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChanges in medal standings.\nRussian team doping case.\nOn 18 July 2016, the McLaren Report was published alleging that the Russian government had sanctioned the use of performance-enhancing drugs by Russian athletes in the 2014 Winter Olympics. \nOn 9 December 2016, a World Anti-Doping Agency report expanded upon the previous report and included the note that \"Two [Russian] [sport] athletes, winners of 4 Sochi Olympic Gold medals, and a female Silver medal winner in [sport] had samples with salt readings that were physiologically impossible\" and that \"Twelve [Russian] medal winning athletes ... from 44 examined samples had scratches and marks on the inside of the caps of their B sample bottles, indicating tampering\".\nIn December 2016, following the release of the McLaren Report on Russian doping at the Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee announced the initiation of an investigation of 28 Russian athletes at the Sochi Olympic Games. The number later rose to 46.\nFrom 1 November 2017 to 22 December 2017, the IOC handled 46 cases related to Russian team doping. 3 cases have been closed without sanction and without official disclosing the names of suspected athletes. 43 Russian athletes were disqualified from the 2014 Winter Olympics and banned from competing in the 2018 edition and all other future Olympic Games as part of the Oswald Commission.\nAll but one of these athletes appealed against their bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. On 1 February 2018, the court overturned the sanctions on 28 athletes meaning that their Sochi medals and results (except four-man bobsleigh) are reinstated, but decided that there was sufficient evidence against 11 athletes to uphold their Sochi sanctions. On 24 September 2020, the court overturned the sanctions on a further two athletes, meaning that one Sochi medal and result in women’s biathlon sprint are reinstated, but decided that there was sufficient evidence against one other athlete to uphold Sochi sanctions in women’s biathlon relay. The court also decided that none of the 42 athletes should be banned from all future Olympic Games, but only the 2018 Games.\nOn 1 February 2018, the IOC said in a statement that “the result of the CAS decision does not mean that athletes from the group of 28 will be invited to the 2018 Games. Not being sanctioned does not automatically confer the privilege of an invitation” and that “this [case] may have a serious impact on the future fight against doping”. The IOC found it important to note that CAS Secretary General \"insisted that the CAS decision does not mean that these 28 athletes are innocent” and that they would consider an appeal against the courts decision. On 9 February 2018, the CAS dismissed 47 appeals from Russian athletes and coaches to the IOC's decision not invite these athletes and coaches to the 2018 Olympics. On 19 January 2019, the IOC's appeal of Legkov's case was rejected and the organization decided not to proceed with 27 remaining cases because the chance of winning would be very low. The IOC voiced its disappointment with the decision."

Players who were leaders on and off the court, showed sportsmanship, and lead their team to victory in most occasions.\nAward winners.\nSchools with multiple winners.\nThe universities that have multiple award winners tend to be schools that are in, if not, close to the state of Arkansas. These schools are known to have a rich history of basketball in their state and the players that earned the award multiple times have either been drafted to the NBA, or played for a team in the NBA G-League. Oklahoma State University was the first-ever school to have achieved the NCAA championships in back-to-back years. In addition, the school has a total of 6 final four appearances throughout the history of the school, so as you can see Oklahoma State is a school with huge success in the basketball department. The University of Kentucky was known to be successful in the first few years of their career, but there were a couple of setbacks that the school experienced, like a couple of Kentucky players being involved in illegal activities that almost costed the coach his job. The University of Florida, like most of the SEC schools, were once thought of as a football college but eventually after making the NCAA tournaments 3 times in a row, the school soon received recognition as a prestigious basketball university winning multiple SEC championships.\nSignificance.\nGeorge Mikan was a big influence in this award being developed, being that he was the first \"Mr. Basketball\" player to ever win the award. His influence on the award gave away the idea for each state in the U.S. to be able to have their own Mr. Basketball award. States, for example like, Illinois, Alabama, and Maine who were able to have significant stories regarding the Mr. Basketball award winners in their state.\nReferences.\n Schumacher, Michael. \"Mr. Basketball: George Mikan, the Minneapolis Lakers, and the Birth of the NBA\".

        "text": "The Rugby League Conference Yorkshire Premier is a division in the Rugby League Conference for teams in the Yorkshire area.\nIt was first contested in 2008 following the break-up of the previous North Premier into the North West and Yorkshire Premiers.\nThis was succeeded by the Yorkshire Men's League in 2012 following the restructuring of the Rugby League Conference.\nHistory.\nThe Rugby League Conference was born in 1997 as the Southern Conference, a 10-team pilot league for teams in the South of England and English Midlands. Rotherham Giants became the first Yorkshire-based team to join when they entered the Northern division in 2000. Other teams followed playing in the North East and North Midlands divisions until a Yorkshire division was created in 2004.\nThe Premier Division were set up in 2005 for teams who had achieved a certain playing standard and were able to travel further afield to find stronger opposition. The new Premier Divisions included the North Premier, the South Premier, the Central Premier and the Welsh Premier. The Central Premier had two Midlands clubs and the rest of the clubs were from Yorkshire or Lancashire whilst the North Premier had clubs from the North East of England and Cumbria. The Premier divisions saw a change in boundaries in 2006 leaving the North Premier division covering a larger area to give the Midlands clubs their own premier division.\nThe Yorkshire Premier came into existence in 2008 when the North Premier was broken up into the North West and Yorkshire Premiers.\nRugby League Conference Pyramid.\nAbove the RLC Yorkshire East and RLC Yorkshire West is the National Division and below is the Yorkshire &amp; Humber Merit League.\nOther Premier divisions are the South, Welsh, Midlands and North West.\n2010 structure.\nTeams play each other on a home-and-away basis. Each Premier division then has its own play-off series to determine the champion with the five divisional winners entering the national play-offs. The winner of the Yorkshire Premier first plays-off against the winner of the North West Premier to determine the overall RLC champion of the North of England. The winner of the national play-offs is awarded the Harry Jepson Trophy.\n2011 structure.\nInstead of having a Yorkshire Premier and a Yorkshire regional league, the teams are split geographically into an East and West League. Each league has 8 teams giving a 14-game league season leading to play-offs.\nFor the play-offs the top 2 teams in the West will play off against the top two teams from the East (West 1 v East 2, East 1 v West 2) for a place in the Premier Grand final - the grand final winner will progress to the national Premier play-offs. Teams 3 and 4 from each division will play off (West 3 v East 4, East 3 v West 4 for a place in the Regional Grand final - the grand final winner will progress to the national regional play-offs."

The Peruvian delegation consisted of three athletes: two alpine skiers—Manfred Oettl Reyes and Ornella Oettl Reyes—and the cross-country skier Roberto Carcelen. The nation's best performance in any event was 67th place in the men's giant slalom alpine skiing event by Manfred Oettl Reyes.\nBackground.\nPeru first competed at the Summer Olympics at the 1936 Berlin Games, and with the exception of the 1952 Helsinki Games, has participated in every Summer Games since. These Vancouver Olympics, however, would mark the nation's first participation in a Winter Olympic Games. The Peruvian delegation consisted of three athletes, the alpine skiers and siblings Manfred Oettl Reyes and Ornella Oettl Reyes, and cross-country skier Roberto Carcelen.\nCarcelen was chosen as the flag bearer for both the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony.\nAlpine skiing.\nManfred Oettl Reyes was 16 years old at the time of the Games. He was born to a German father, and a Peruvian mother, and at the time, said he had only been to Peru twice in his life. His first event, the giant slalom, was held on 23 February. He posted run times of 1 minute and 29 seconds and 1 minute and 32 seconds. This saw him in 67th place out of 81 competitors who finished the race. On 27 February, he was disqualified during the first run of the slalom.\nOrnella Oettl Reyes was 18 years old at the time of the Vancouver Olympics. During 24–25 February, she took part in the weather-impacted giant slalom, finishing the first run in a time of 1 minute and 27 seconds, but she failed to finish the second run and went unplaced in the final standings. The next day, she had a similar experience in the giant slalom, finishing the first run in a time of 59 seconds, but failing to complete the second run.\nCross-country skiing.\nRoberto Carcelen was 39 years old at the time of the Vancouver Olympics. He took up skiing at the age of 34, after meeting his wife on an online dating site and moving from Peru to Seattle, Washington. He secured qualification at an event held at the Silver Star Mountain Resort in British Columbia. In his race, the 15 kilometre freestyle, he finished with a time of 45 minutes and 53 seconds, placing 94th out of 95 competitors."

As a publicity stunt, the Americans billed Boileau, a French Canadian, as \"the first Native American in the NHL\" and claimed his name was Rainy Drinkwater. René was the father of the former NHL hockey player, Marc Boileau.\nPlaying career.\nBoileau, a native of Pointe-Claire, Quebec, played his only season in the NHL in 1925–26. Prior to joining the Americans, he played three seasons of amateur hockey in Montreal. Americans manager Tommy Duggan was anxious to promote the first-year Americans and upon signing Boileau used him as part of a publicity stunt. The Americans official announcement on the signing promoted Boileau under the pseudonym \"Rainy Drinkwater\" and announced that the French-Canadian player was instead from the Caughnawaga Indian Reservation, and the first Native American to play in the NHL. The Canadian press took note of the promotion; former \"Toronto Star\" sports editor Milt Dunnell said that \"He received more ink than Sitting Bull\". He played only seven games with the Americans, scoring no points.\nBoileau spent the next five seasons playing professional hockey with the Niagara Falls Cataracts of the Canadian Professional Hockey League, New Haven Eagles of the Canadian American Hockey League and St. Louis Flyers of the American Hockey Association. He then played two seasons of semi-professional hockey in Quebec teams before retiring in 1934. His son, Marc, played and coached in the NHL."

A team time trial was reintroduced. This was last competed as a world championship event in 1994 between nations. The reintroduction will see trade teams compete, similar to the Eindhoven Team Time Trial held between 2005 and 2007. The Junior championships will also be on the programme. With the extra events, the championships will be held over two weekends (nine days) and will also include an opening ceremony and a cyclosportive event.\nThe start and finish for the events was in Vilt, a commune of Valkenburg aan de Geul on top of the Cauberg.\nSchedule.\nCircuit = west on Rijksweg in Vilt, continuing through Berg en Terblijt onto Bergerstraat, turning left grazing Maastricht on the east by going south on Molenweg, then turning left and continuing east on Bemelerweg, continuing onto Oude Akerstraat and Bemelerberg through Bemelen, continuing onto Gasthuis, turning left and continuing northeast On Smitserweg, which turns into Bemelerweg grazing Sibbe on the west and into Daalhemerweg curving to north all the way into Valkenburg aan de Geul, at the end turning left onto Cauberg, back to Vilt.\nParticipating nations.\nCyclists from 74 national federations participated.

        "text": "Andorra sent a delegation to compete in the 2010 Winter Olympics held in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, from 12 to 28 February 2010. Andorra has never won an Olympic medal, despite appearing at every Winter and Summer Games since 1976. The Andorran delegation to these Olympics consisted of six athletes, four in alpine skiing, one in cross-country skiing, and one in snowboarding, the last being Lluís Marin Tarroch, the first snowboarder to represent Andorra at the Olympics. He placed 34th in his only event, and failed to advance to the quarterfinals as a result. Francesc Soulié, the first Andorran cross-country skier to compete at the Games, made his second Olympics appearance, achieving a 47th place finish in the best of his three events. The four alpine skiers that competed recorded six DNFs in their thirteen combined events, though Mireia Gutiérrez recorded a team-high 24th-place result in her best event.\nBackground.\nThe Winter Olympics were first held in 1924, and since then had grown to include 86 events covering 7 different winter sports. The Andorran Olympic Committee was recognized by the International Olympic Committee on 31 December 1974. They first participated in Olympic competition at the 1976 Winter Olympics and have taken part in every Summer and Winter Olympics since. Coming into 2010, Andorra had never won a medal in either the Summer or Winter Olympics. Competition in Vancouver, British Columbia, lasted from 12 to 28 February 2010. The bidding process to host the competition was won by Vancouver on the second ballot, defeating eventual 2018 hosts Pyongchang. Andorra's delegation made up six of the 2,626 total athletes competing, with 82 nations represented.\nThe Andorran delegation to Vancouver consisted of six athletes, four in alpine skiing, one in cross-country skiing, and one in snowboarding. Lluís Marin Tarroch, the snowboarder, was chosen as the flag bearer for the opening ceremony, while alpine skier Mireia Gutiérrez was selected to carry the flag for the closing ceremony. Alpine skiers Sofie Juarez, Kevin Esteve Rigail, and Roger Vidosa, and cross-country skier Francesc Soulié, comprised the rest of the Andorran delegation.\nAlpine skiing.\nThe Andorran alpine skiing team consisted of four members: Mireia Gutiérrez, in her first Games at age 21, Sofie Juarez, in her first Games at age 18, Kevin Esteve Rigail, in his first Games at age 20, and Roger Vidosa, in his second Games at age 25. On the women's side, Gutiérrez competed in four events, while Juarez competed in two. Both women competed in the giant slalom, though neither finished the race; the latter was not able to finish her other event, the slalom, either. Gutiérrez recorded a DNF in the super-G, but finished in 28th position in the downhill race and in 24th in the combined race, the latter of which was the best finish for an Andorran in any event at the 2010 Games. The men's side had a bit more overlap, as Esteve was joined by Vidosa in all three of his events. The pair finished side-by-side—47th and 48th—and separated by only 0.04 seconds in the downhill event, while Vidosa finished ahead of Esteve by six spots in the super-G. Vidosa finished in 25th position in the combined race, but Esteve was one of 18 competitors not to finish. In addition, Vidosa competed in the giant slalom event, but recorded a DNF.\nOf the four competitors, two would go on to compete in another Olympic Games – Esteve competed in one event in 2014, and Gutiérrez competed in three and one events in 2014 and 2018, respectively.\nCross-country skiing.\nThe first cross-country skier to represent Andorra in the Winter Olympics (and the only one until Irineu Esteve Altimiras in 2018), Francesc Soulié competed in his second Games in 2010 at the age of 31. Both of Soulié's two distance races did not include qualifiers, but rather one single event that functioned as a final. In the 15 km race, he finished in 73rd place out of the 95 competitors to start the race, nearly five minutes behind the gold medalist, while in the 50 km race he placed 47th out of the 53 skiers to start, though only 48 finished the race. In his lone non-distance event, the men's sprint, Soulié was eliminated after placing 56th in the field of 62 competitors during the qualification stage, in which only the top 30 skiers advanced to the quarterfinals. As of 2018, this was Soulié's last appearance at an Olympic Games.\nSnowboarding.\nLluís Marin Tarroch became the first, and as of the 2018 Winter Olympics, only snowboarder to represent Andorra at the Olympics. Tarroch was 21 years old at the time of the Vancouver Olympics. In the men's snowboard cross, the qualifying round was held on 15 February. The format was that everyone got two races, and the best of an athlete's two times counted. The top 32 would advance to the next round. Tarroch did not finish the first run, and had to rely on his second run time of 1 minute and 47.36 seconds, which put him in 34th place, and he was eliminated. He would go on to represent Andorra at the 2014 and 2018 Winter Olympics."

Williams qualified to play for Germany through his German mother and, after backpacking through Europe and watching Australia play in the 2007 Rugby World Cup, he had a trial for Germany, which he passed. He impressed Germany's director of rugby, Peter Ianusevici, enough to field him in Germany's next game.\nHe made his debut for Germany on 24 November 2007, three days after his trial, a 34–5 victory against Moldova in Heidelberg. He neither speaks German nor was he able to sing the German national anthem, but he indicated his willingness to learn both for the upcoming spring tests in early 2008. His debut for Germany however meant, he was not eligible to play for his native country Australia in the future, as the International Rugby Board allows a player to play for only one country.\nWilliams played three games for the team in the 2006-2008 European Nations Cup Second Division, his last on 26 April 2008, against the Netherlands, with Germany winning all three of them and securing promotion to the 2008-2010 European Nations Cup First Division.\nAfter his stint in Europe and playing for Germany, he now again plays in Australia, for Mosman Rugby Club. He is a European and Business Studies student at Sydney's Macquarie University.

        "title": "Binghamton University basketball scandal",
        "text": "The Binghamton University basketball scandal refers to a series of incidents that occurred as Binghamton University compromised its integrity in order to make the Bearcats men's basketball program more competitive in Division I. Numerous Binghamton players were arrested and dismissed from the team in the fall of 2009, continuing a troubling trend of misconduct from basketball players at the university. The arrests led to an investigation by the State University of New York (SUNY), Binghamton's parent institution, which found that Binghamton's administration had significantly lowered its admissions standards for prospective recruits under pressure from men's head coach Kevin Broadus and his staff. It also detailed several potential NCAA violations by Broadus and his staff. Numerous Binghamton professors admitted to academic fraud, having changed grades for basketball players upon pressure from members of the athletic department.\nThe scandal resulted in Broadus' suspension in October 2009 and eventual resignation a year later. It also resulted in the resignation of the school's athletic director Joel Thirer, the firing of two assistant coaches, and the dismissal of six players from the team. Due to the fallout from the scandal, Binghamton elected to sit out postseason play in 2010. The SUNY investigation was forwarded to the NCAA, who discovered that Binghamton had committed two secondary violations but no major violations. Binghamton University's president, Lois B. DeFleur, announced her plans to retire when it became public that the report of the findings from an investigation would implicate her as being responsible for the impropriety.\nFollowing the scandal, Binghamton's men's basketball program was left in ruin. The team has yet to record a winning overall or conference record since, bottoming out during the 2011–12 season when the Bearcats finished 2–29, losing their first 26 games, for the worst record in program history.\nBackground.\nThe success of Binghamton had been one of the great stories of the 2008–09 basketball season. In just the school's eighth season as a Division I program, Broadus led the Bearcats to a school record-tying 23 wins, a tie for first place in the America East Conference, and the school's first conference tournament title in 63 years. In the first round of the NCAA Tournament, the No. 15-seeded Bearcats played No. 2 seed Duke, losing 86–62. Broadus was named the America East coach of the year, earning a contract extension through the 2013–14 season.\nHowever, many were concerned that Binghamton had cut too many corners in its bid for basketball glory, sacrificing its reputation as a strong academic institution in the process. Management professor Dennis Lasser, the school's former faculty athletics representative, helped lead the effort to move Binghamton from Division III to Division I in 2001 but lost his job after Broadus was hired as head coach. Lasser, a vocal critic of the program's direction, was replaced by Sandra McMichael, a close friend of DeFleur's. Lasser claimed that after the coaching change, Binghamton had lowered its standards for admitting prospective basketball players to the bare minimum required by the NCAA. ESPN analyst Tom Brennan, a former coach at Binghamton's America East conference-mate Vermont, told \"The New York Times\" that \"It certainly appears to me that Binghamton has decided they’re going to take a lot of risks, and it also appears that it hasn’t worked out. Even if they win an America East championship, what is it worth?\"\nOn March 18, 2009, a day before Binghamton was set to take on Duke in the 2009 NCAA tournament, Elizabeth Williams, a major gifts officer for Binghamton athletics, accused associate athletic director Jason Siegel of grabbing her breast in an elevator. The accusation was amongst larger claims of \"egregious acts of sexual misconduct\" in the Binghamton athletic department, which included innuendo and sexist comments in the workplace. Williams sued Binghamton in July, alleging that athletic officials called her a sexual \"plaything\", commanded her to dress provocatively for fundraisers and asked how much money it would cost to have sex with her.\nRecruitment controversies.\nAs an assistant coach at George Washington and Georgetown, Broadus recruited players from Lutheran Christian Academy, a school in Philadelphia widely accused of being a diploma mill. One of those players, Mike Egerson, transferred to Lutheran Christian after earning only a 1.33 grade point average at his Delaware high school and garnering an SAT score in the 600s. Shortly before Broadus was hired at Binghamton, the NCAA announced it would no longer accept coursework from Lutheran Christian and several other suspected diploma mills. However, Binghamton continued to recruit players with a history at Lutheran Christian, accepting center Theo Davis and guard Devon McBride. Davis, a transfer from Gonzaga University, had a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge on his record.\nSeveral players on Binghamton's 2008–09 championship roster had transferred to the team while facing academic problems at their former schools. Guard D.J. Rivera was forced to sit out a semester at Saint Joseph's University due to academic problems. Guard Malik Alvin left the University of Texas at El Paso because of academic concerns and transferred to junior college before coming to Binghamton. Guard Emanuel \"Tiki\" Mayben initially signed with Syracuse University before he was deemed academically ineligible coming out of high school and also came to Binghamton as a junior college transfer.\nInitial backlash.\nIn May 2008, sophomore center Miladin Kovacevic, who was recruited by Broadus' predecessor Al Walker, beat a fellow student Bryan Steinhauer into a three-month coma and fled to his native Serbia with the help of two Serbian diplomats. The assault garnered severe negative media attention and became the subject of an ESPN \"\" special which aired in May 2009.\nIn November 2008, Alvin was arrested for stealing Magnum condoms from a local Walmart even as condoms were available for free on campus. While being chased by security officers, Alvin assaulted a 66-year-old woman, giving her a concussion. He was charged with petty larceny and third-degree assault, but pleaded not guilty. Alvin was suspended for three games, but charges were subsequently dropped and he returned to the lineup for the rest of the season. In January 2009, senior guard Dwayne Jackson was suspended indefinitely from the team for an undisclosed violation. Broadus himself was suspended for one game in 2008 after shoving Albany assistant head coach Chad O'Donnell during a postgame handshake.\nThe arrests and suspensions of Binghamton basketball players began to draw backlash within the community. Former Binghamton associate athletic director Tim Schum said, \"They’re on a very slippery slope. There is a double standard for what basketball will put up with compared to the standards for other sports. I don’t know if it’s written, but it’s certainly understood.\"\nA \"New York Times\" report in February 2009 revealed that Sally Dear, an adjunct lecturer at Binghamton's human development department, taught three basketball players in her human development class who habitually missed classes and appointments or showed up late to class while leaving early. Dear admitted that the trio of players repeatedly halted class with their disruptive behavior and alleged that Ed Scott, an associate athletic director, harassed her regarding her treatment of her athlete students. Dear would later reveal in 2019 that an assistant dean suggested that she change the poor grades of the basketball players in her class, with knowledge that other professors at the university were already doing the same.\nMcBride, who would leave the team after an argument with Broadus, told \"The New York Times\" that many of his teammates frequently drank alcohol and smoked marijuana, but Broadus made no effort to rein in their off-the-court behavior.\nThese concerns led America East commissioner Patrick Nero to talk with school president Lois DeFleur and athletic director Joel Thirer about the team's behavior. The America East's other coaches reportedly voiced their displeasure with the way Broadus ran the program by bumping D.J. Rivera, the conference's leading scorer, to a Second Team All-Conference selection in 2009. The move was believed to be made as a silent protest of Binghamton's recruiting process and the suspicious approval of Rivera's transfer waiver, which allowed him to play without sitting out a season.\nArrests and mass dismissals.\nOn September 13, 2009, Binghamton University police stopped Mayben for speeding and discovered marijuana in his car. Mayben told the police that the marijuana belonged to his teammate David Fine, who had been questioned by police after being caught with two grams of marijuana in his dorm room less than a week earlier. Mayben was ultimately cited for speeding and unlawful possession of marijuana.\nOn September 14, a Binghamton student reported that her debit card was stolen and used illegally to purchase numerous items, including a television set. After questioning player Chretien Lukusa and reviewing store surveillance footage, Binghamton University police identified Rivera, Alvin and Paul Crosby as the culprits. A fourth basketball player, Corey Chandler, confessed to the police about his role in the crime. Rivera stated that he had found the card at a party and used it to make purchases with his teammates. The Kaye report would reveal that Lukusa informed the victim of a potential illegal purchase on her debit card and went to the police station on his own accord to identify his teammates on the surveillance footage; in response, Alvin posted on Facebook, \"Chretien Lakusa is a Rat\" \"[sic]\".\nOn September 23, Mayben, Binghamton's starting point guard and second-leading scorer, was arrested and charged with possessing and selling crack cocaine. Broadus, saying he'd \"done all [he] could\" to help Mayben, kicked him off the team the next day.\nOn September 25, Broadus announced that five other players — Rivera, Alvin, Crosby, Chandler and Fine — had been kicked off the team for unspecified violations of team rules, which was later revealed as the debit card incident per the Kaye report. Within 48 hours, Binghamton had lost its three top scorers from the previous season. With only seven scholarship players and no experienced guards, it was widely believed that the Bearcats' 2009-10 season was over before it even started. Lasser said that these dismissals amounted to an \"implosion\" of the Bearcat program. Although Broadus claimed the decision was his alone, the dismissals came on the same day that SUNY chancellor Nancy Zimpher demanded that DeFleur give her a full accounting of what was being done to address Mayben's arrest and other unspecified incidents. Zimpher was known for having little tolerance for athletic misconduct. While president of the University of Cincinnati, she had forced longtime basketball coach Bob Huggins to resign in 2005. Although Huggins had taken Cincinnati to heights it had not seen since the 1960s, Zimpher had been displeased with the team's poor academic performance and misbehavior off the court.\nOn September 29, Dear was told she was being let go as part of a cost-cutting measure. However, Dear alleged that she had been fired due to her February interview with \"The New York Times\" which brought to light how she was being pressured to give preferential treatment to disruptive basketball players. Dear's colleagues admitted to her that they had changed grades for athletes.\nOn September 30, Thirer resigned as athletic director, a post he had held since 1989. Despite his role in the scandal, he would be inducted into Binghamton's Hall of Fame in 2011.\nInvestigation and Kaye report.\nAudit announced.\nOn October 2, Zimpher announced plans for a full audit of Binghamton's athletic department. Significantly, Zimpher stated that the audit would be overseen by the SUNY board of trustees, and not by Binghamton itself. On the same day, it was announced that Dear had been rehired. The probe was directed by Judith Kaye, the former chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals.\nBroadus suspended.\nOn October 14, Binghamton suspended Broadus indefinitely with pay. In announcing the suspension, acting athletic director Jim Norris cited numerous \"incidents of concern.\" Assistant coach Mark Macon, a former star at Temple, was named interim head coach. The announcement came a week after Broadus publicly apologized to several of his athletic department colleagues for bringing \"shame\" to Binghamton by not properly controlling his program. Broadus was in the center of another controversy after he admitted to contacting recruits on the first day of the period when coaches are not allowed to speak with prospects that they are scouting.\nKaye report and findings.\nOn February 11, 2010, Kaye released her findings in a 99-page report. Kaye found that under pressure from Broadus, Binghamton had lowered its standards for admitting basketball players to the NCAA minimum. In bowing to this pressure, Kaye said, DeFleur, Thirer and other officials had significantly compromised Binghamton's academic standards even though Binghamton was not prepared to take in this many academically marginal students. Basketball players had been given credit for courses titled \"Theories of Softball\" and \"Bowling I\".\nAccording to the report, the mass dismissal of September 25, 2009 had not been Broadus' decision, but was ordered by Thirer. The dismissed players had been involved in several incidents reported to Binghamton University police, including the aforementioned marijuana offenses and the debit card theft, which were made public information for the first time. School officials had been willing to let Broadus handle the raft of discipline problems at first. However, after Mayben's September 23 arrest, Thirer called Broadus into his office and told him that Rivera, Alvin, Chandler, Crosby and Fine all had to go. Rivera, Alvin, Crosby and Chandler were suspected of stealing another student's debit card and using it to buy several items. The report also revealed a text message exchange between Broadus and assistant coach Mark Hsu in which the two discussed coaching the players on what to tell school police during the investigation of the stolen debit card. The police believed that Rivera was taking the fall for the debit card incident to cover for his teammates and told Hsu that the players had lied in their sworn statements.\nThe Kaye report found evidence of potential academic fraud by Broadus and his staff. In a text message exchange between Alvin and Hsu, Alvin asked Hsu to rewrite a paper for him because Alvin had copied it off the Internet. In another, Alvin copied another paper off the Internet, but added a conclusion in his own words on advice from Hsu. Broadus was also accused of having professors change players' grades, which was never proven to be true. Alvin and Hsu also discussed what appeared to reference cash payments.\nThe report revealed that Binghamton men's basketball players had a GPA of 2.15 for the fall 2009 semester and a 2.21 cumulative GPA, but the school was able to sweep this information under the rug by repeatedly stating that the overall cumulative GPA of all Binghamton student-athletes \"has exceeded 3.0 in 12 of our 15 semesters in Division I.\" In a meeting with admissions officials, an athletic official asked, \"Why do you care if we take six players who don’t attend classes?\" The report also stated that following Binghamton's men's basketball championship in 2009, DeFleur put increased pressure on coaches of other sports to produce championships, stating that the university needed more flexibility in admitting student-athletes with poor academics.\nAfter Mayben had been kicked off the team, the report recounted an incident in which Mayben swore to \"bring down\" the basketball program by going to ESPN and \"The New York Times\" with information about Broadus paying for junior college transfers and cell phones. Mayben would later recant the allegations, and all coaches and players denied giving or receiving improper benefits.\nThe report also detailed Binghamton's contentious relationship with the rest of the America East conference. Other schools observed Binghamton players taunting the crowd, using foul language and engaging in on-court shouting matches with assistant coaches during games. During the June 2009 America East meetings, the eight other athletic directors in the conference confronted Thirer about their unhappiness with Binghamton's conduct and Rivera's immediate transfer waiver grant, still frustrated over Thirer's refusal to admit Binghamton had acted inappropriately. The America East's anger at Binghamton escalated again after Broadus' contract extension and Binghamton's acceptance of Chandler, who was admitted to the university 13 days after being kicked off the Rutgers basketball team due to multiple disciplinary violations. By the fall of 2009, several of the conference's athletic directors and presidents mulled the idea of kicking Binghamton out of the America East Conference.\nKaye recommended, among other things, that SUNY appoint an \"athletic oversight officer\" for the entire SUNY system, reporting directly to the chancellor.\nIn a conference call with reporters, Zimpher said, \"I am disappointed that a great institution like Binghamton University would, in any way, because of its athletic program, compromise its terrific academic reputation.\" She also promised sweeping changes.\nFallout.\nMacon was forced to hold tryouts in October to replenish his decimated roster, adding Mikey Horn, Preston Pena, Javon Ralling, and Charlie Fackler to the roster. He also had to deal with two of his assistants, Hsu and Julius Allen, being fired midseason, leaving him with only one assistant coach. Under the circumstances, he kept Binghamton fairly competitive, managing to finish with a .500 record in America East play and 13–18 overall, with seven of their losses by 10 points or less.\nOn March 1, DeFleur announced that the Bearcats would sit out the 2010 conference tournament and were withdrawing from postseason consideration. She said that given the current turmoil in the program, \"it is not appropriate that we play in this year's postseason.\" Although Nero said the decision was Binghamton's alone, two America East sources told the \"Times\" that the league's other members did not want the Bearcats in the tournament and pressured them to withdraw, reinforcing the notion that the America East was seriously considering expelling Binghamton from the conference.\nBrennan, who had been critical of Binghamton's athletic program for multiple years, questioned \"At what price glory? Not only have they embarrassed themselves and the university, but they’ve embarrassed the America East as well.\" A group of eighteen Binghamton professors signed a statement pushing the university to drop down from Division I, condemning Binghamton's president for her role in the scandal. \"Lois B. DeFleur’s two-decades-long tenure as president of Binghamton University has ended in real harm to the university’s reputation and pride,\" the statement read.\nZimpher eventually assigned SUNY’s interim provost, David K. Lavallee, to lead an overall effort for the SUNY system to ensure that academics remain the highest priority; and Charles R. Westgate, a professor in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Binghamton, as a special adviser for academics and athletics for the SUNY system: moves some critics of the over-emphasis on athletics decried as insufficient. Zimpher also announced that while Broadus will not return as coach, a permanent replacement will not be hired until the school has a permanent president and athletic director.\nOn March 26, Broadus filed a racial discrimination complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights. Broadus claimed that he was being treated more harshly than other Binghamton coaches whose players had been arrested simply because he was the only minority coach at the school.\nThe Kaye report was forwarded to the NCAA, which could have issued its own sanctions in addition to Binghamton's own decision to pull out of postseason play. On October 18, the NCAA found that Hsu had committed two secondary violations by providing impermissible travel to two players. However, due to lack of cooperation from involved parties, the NCAA was unable to find any major violations. Due to the lack of major violations, Broadus' lawyer asked for his reinstatement, but Zimpher reiterated that he would not return as coach. On October 28, Broadus announced he was filing a federal discrimination lawsuit against Binghamton and SUNY. Hours later, the three parties reached a settlement in which Broadus would resign and take a $1.2 million buyout in return for dropping all legal action against Binghamton or SUNY.\nIn November 2011, senior Kyrie Sutton, the last remaining player from Binghamton's 2009 champion squad, was dismissed from the team after he was arrested for the misdemeanor of criminal possession of stolen property. It was Sutton's fourth legal incident since joining Binghamton. Nearly a year later, in October 2012, senior Javon Ralling and freshman Jordan Reed were suspended after both were arrested for disorderly conduct. Ralling was also charged with resisting arrest.\nOn April 30, 2012, Mark Macon was fired as head coach of the men's basketball team. Macon's Bearcats began the 2011–12 season with a 0–26 record, the last remaining winless team in Division I, and ended the regular season at 1–28 for the worst season in program history. In three seasons as head coach, Macon went 24–68 in his tenure.\nIn May 2014, Binghamton University became one of four New York universities, and the only SUNY, being investigated for suspected Title IX civil rights violations.\nBinghamton's basketball program has never recovered from the scandal. From 2010 to 2020, the Bearcats amassed a record of 90–250 (.265), going 42–134 (.239) in America East conference play."

He was one of the more recognizable players due to his small stature. He stands tall and weighs in at .\nClub career.\nGordon made his Albany Bulldogs debut in March 2007, taking the field as the number 8 and leading the team to initial victory over their rival Saratoga Mustangs. While the team began to struggle over the course of the Capital District Youth Rugby season, Gordon flourished as the team's defensive stalwart and was named to the 2nd Team All-CDYR Team and was declared team MVP without scoring a single try.\nGordon was named captain of the Bulldogs at the beginning of the 2008 season and continued to lead them throughout the 2009 season, sevens season, and post-seasons. He submitted his greatest season during the Bulldog's 2009 season, scoring a league record 16 tries and bringing his career total to a record 22 tries. He was named 1st Team All-CDYR for the second consecutive year while also earning League MVP honors. The Bulldogs experienced similar success, taking a 5-1 record and the 1st seed into the CDYR Post-Season Tournament, ultimately finishing second to the Berkshire United RFC after a controversial 12-12 overtime game went to sudden death kick rules.\nCollege career.\nGordon announced his decision at the conclusion of the 2009 CDYR Tournament that he would pursue an education from, and continue his playing career at, Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania. While studying Safety and Environmental Management, he joined the local Shamrock RFC men's team. After an unsuccessful attempt at playing number eight again (due to his size), Gordon changed positions to wing. A fruitful rookie year was derailed by a torn PCL due to an ill-advised backflip attempt, but Gordon continued playing through the injury, worsening the severity. Gordon continued playing until September 2011, when he enlisted in the National Guard. After going through BCT in Fort Benning and completing a deployment to the Middle East, Gordon returned to the Shamrocks. During the Fall 2013 season, Gordon made the positional switch to Flanker. It was a very successful change, as Gordon led the Shamrocks in scoring with 7 tries and being voted team MVP. The next semester, Gordon was elected captain and enjoyed another successful tournament season. Currently, Gordon is living in Slippery Rock, Pennsylvania full-time, training for the upcoming 2014 rugby season."

The Wildcats have four Elite Eight appearances and seventeen appearances in the NCAA Division I women's basketball tournament. They have won the SEC tournament twice and SEC regular season championship once.\nThe first University of Kentucky women's basketball team was organized in 1902, and competed for the first time on Feb. 21, 1903. However, in 1924, despite a perfect 10-0 season, the University Senate passed a bill to abolish women's basketball in part because, according to state politicians, \"basketball had proven to be a strenuous sport for boys and therefore was too strenuous for girls.\"\nAfter 50 years, women's basketball was granted varsity status in 1974, and most of the official records maintained by the university only reflect games since that time. The team, coached by Sue Feamster, was given the nickname \"Lady Kats\", which continued to be used until May 1995.\nThe team's current head coach is Kenny Brooks, who was hired from Virginia Tech after Kyra Elzy was fired in March 2024.\nFacilities.\nSince the restoration of the program in 1974, the Kentucky Wildcats have played their home games in the 8,500 seat Memorial Coliseum, and their record attendance in that building is 10,622, set on February 5, 1983 against Old Dominion; they also led the nation with an average attendance of 3,645 that season. In recent years, the team has also played occasional games in Rupp Arena, which had a capacity of 23,500 before a renovation completed in 2019 reduced the capacity to 20,545.\nIn January 2007, the university opened the Joe Craft Center, a $30 million state-of-the-art basketball practice facility for both the men's and women's teams, named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft.\nIn July 2022, Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart announced that Memorial Coliseum would be receiving extensive upgrades during the 2023-2024 athletics season. Most notably, air conditioning would be added to the building for the first time, as well as seating upgrades, and the addition of new event space. The renovations are expected to last for one year, displacing all four teams who call the arena home, including women's basketball. On April 18, 2023, Barnhart announced that the majority of the 2023-2024 women's basketball season will be played at Rupp Arena, with a select number of games being played at Transylvania University's Clive M.

        "title": "National Hunt Chase Challenge Cup",
        "text": "The National Hunt Challenge Cup is a Grade 2 National Hunt steeplechase in Great Britain for amateur riders which is open to horses aged five years or older. It is run on the Old Course at Cheltenham over a distance of about 3 miles 6 furlongs (3 miles 5 furlongs and 201 yards, or 6,018 metres), and during its running there are twenty-three fences to be jumped. The race is for novice chasers, and it is scheduled to take place each year during the Cheltenham Festival in March.\nHistory.\nNow in its year, the National Hunt Chase has been run more times than any other event at the Cheltenham Festival. The Grand Annual is older, but that race was absent for much of the late 19th century.\nDuring the early part of its history it was held at various venues, including its present home in 1904 and 1905. It was transferred more permanently to Cheltenham in 1911, when it became part of the new two-day National Hunt Meeting. Until the 1930s it was the second most important jumps race in the calendar after the Grand National.\nAt 3 miles and 7½ furlongs prior to 2020, the distance of the National Hunt Chase was longer than that of any other event at the Festival. It is now the second-longest after the Glenfarclas Cross Country Chase. The race was contested on Cheltenham's New Course from 2005 to 2007, and during this period its length was 4 miles and 1 furlong (). The 2008 running was titled the Peter O'Sullevan National Hunt Chase in celebration of the 90th birthday of Peter O'Sullevan, a retired racing commentator and the 2012 running was titled the Diamond Jubilee National Hunt Chase to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II. The 2013 race was run as the John Oaksey National Hunt Chase in memory of John Oaksey, a notable amateur National Hunt jockey and racing journalist who died in September 2012. The National Hunt Chase was given Listed status by the British Horseracing Board from its 2014 running and included the name of former champion jockey Terry Biddlecombe, who died in January 2014, in its title. The 2015 race name commemorated trainer Toby Balding. The race was upgraded to Grade 2 status from the 2017 running.\nThe race distance was reduced to about 3 miles and 6 furlongs from the 2020 running after a controversy in 2019. Only four of 18 runners finished the 2019 race. Three jockeys were banned by the racecourse stewards for continuing to ride on tired horses, although the bans were subsequently overturned on appeal. The British Horseracing Authority conducted a review of the race which led to a cut in its distance and the number of fences jumped, along with some other changes relating to the eligibility of horses and jockeys to take part. Only professional jockeys competed in the 2021 running as amateur riders were excluded from the Cheltenham Festival due to restrictions on grassroots sport for the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom.\nRecords.\nLeading jockey since 1946 (4 wins):\nLeading trainer since 1946 (6 wins):"

They play at the NCAA Division I level, and compete in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA).\nHistory.\nThe Bemidji State University intercollegiate women's ice hockey program began competition in the 1998–1999 season. The first head coach was Ruthann Cantile. She was head coach from the program's founding to the start of WCHA play, and the beginning of national NCAA Championships in 2001.\nOver the next several years, Bemidji State met with little success, while playing against the best teams in the nation, in conference play. The Beavers were able to recruit 2002 German Olympian Defender Nina Zieganhals in 2003. After disappointing seasons under Jason Lesterberg (2000–01) and Bruce Olson, who left the program during the 2005–06 season, Bemidji State hired Steve Sertich for the 2006–07 season. Sertich presided over the team for eight years until his retirement in 2014.\nOn February 27, 2010, Bemidji State ended its 14-game playoff losing streak in a 2–1 victory over St. Cloud State. The next day, the Beavers defeated St. Cloud State in Game 3, and advanced to the WCHA Final Face-Off for the first time in school history. Zuzana Tomcikova had 27 saves and the win was the Beavers 12th win of the season. It tied the school record for most wins in a season (accomplished in 2001–02). The Beavers advanced to play the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs in the WCHA semi-finals but were eliminated.\nOn October 16, 2010, Beaver goaltender Alana McElhinney made a career-high 56 saves. In the game, Bemidji State had its first-ever win over a No. 1-ranked team as they defeated the Mercyhurst Lakers by a 5–3 mark. In addition, this was the second women's game ever played at the new Bemidji Regional Event Center.\nOctober 29–30, 2010: Erin Cody had the biggest weekend of her collegiate career. She was involved in all seven of the Bemidji State's goals, as the Beavers swept St. Cloud State. Cody had five goals and two assists, and was a factor in both game-winning goals. Cody earned the First Star of the Game honors in both games. In the first game, Cody scored a natural hat trick (a power-play, shorthanded, and even-strength goal). All three goals were scored in the first period and set a Beavers record for most goals scored by a single player in one period. In the second game, Cody had two goals and two assists.\nOn January 28, 2012, the Badgers hosted a record crowd of 12,402 at the Kohl Center as Wisconsin swept the Bemidji State Beavers. Alex Rigby made 28 saves to obtain her sixth shutout of the campaign. Her rival between the pipes, Bemidji State goaltender Zuzana Tomcikova made 32 saves.\nThe Beavers made history on March 7, 2015, as they defeated the Minnesota Golden Gophers by a 1–0 tally in the semifinals of the WCHA Final Face-Off. The game-winning goal was scored by Stephanie Anderson in the third period. Beavers goaltender Brittni Mowat made 37 saves, registering her seventh shutout of the season, a new program record. In addition, it marked the first time that the Beavers advanced to the championship game of the WCHA Final Face-Off.\nOn February 29, 2020, the Bemidji State Beavers beat the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs in the fourth overtime period of their WCHA Quarterfinal match, making it in the longest game in WCHA women's ice hockey history, and the second longest in NCAA history. Beaver forward Reece Hunt scored the game-winning goal at 8:43 of the fourth overtime. The game lasted four hours and 50 minutes, with 128:43 of on-ice time. The final score was 2–1. The victory marked Jim Scanlon's 100th win as head coach for Bemidji; he is the first coach in the women's ice hockey program's history to reach 100 wins.\nCurrent roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;"

S. ever turned out.\" He enrolled at Rutgers University in 1910 and was a star athlete in both basketball and football. He played at the tackle position for the Rutgers football team from 1910 to 1914. In September 1912, \"The New York Times\" called Toohey \"Rutgers' greatest tackle,\" and noted that Toohey's brother also planned to play at tackle for Rutgers. Toohey worked during the summer of 1913 building the Croton Aqueduct, and there was uncertainty as to whether he would return for another season of football. When he announced his intent to return to the gridiron, the \"New Brunswick Times\" reported: \"Toohey Is Back Ready To Jump In The Game.\" In November 1913, Toohey was elected by his teammates as captain of Rutgers' 1914 football team. In December 1913, the Board of Managers at Rutgers ruled that Toohey was ineligible to play in 1914, having already played four seasons with the football team. The decision of the Board of Managers sparked a controversy, as alumni sought to restore his eligibility, and others criticized any leniency in enforcing the four-year eligibility rule. Toohey's eligibility was ultimately restored, and he was the captain of the 1914 Rutgers team. Following a 33-0 win over NYU in November 1914, \"The New York Times\" praised Toohey for his blocking: \"Toohey weights 210 pounds and made a whole in the line ten yards wide.\" He was also selected as a first-team All-American in 1914 by James P. Sinnot of the \"New York Evening Mail\", the \"New York Globe\", sports writer Daniel of the \"New York Press\" the \"Newark Sunday Call\", and \"Newark Evening Star\". In announcing the selection of Toohey, Daniel wrote:\"Among the tackles we place Toohey of Rutgers on an even plane with Ballin of Princeton. Despite his 210 pounds Toohey is a speedy and is a stone wall on defense. He played Ballin in the Princeton game, and had distinctly the better of the Tiger captain.\"\nIn 1915, Toohey's eligibility to play for the Rutgers football team was finally revoked under \"the four-year residence rule,\" but he assisted in training the team's linemen during the 1915 football season.\nToohey was inducted into the Rutgers Athletic Hall of Fame in 1995."

        "text": "Baseball Canada is the national governing body for baseball in Canada. They are members of the Canadian Olympic Committee and the World Baseball Softball Confederation. \nIncorporated in 1964 as the Canadian Federation of Amateur Baseball, it is made up of 10 provincial associations which represent players, coaches, and umpires across Canada. \nThey are funded and recognized by Sport Canada and Heritage Canada, and is recognized by Revenue Canada as having charitable status.\nNational Baseball Teams.\nMen's national team.\nCanada competes in all WBSC sanctioned events. They were part of the inaugural World Baseball Classic tournament in 2006, where they recorded their best ever result of ninth place. They have sent teams to two Olympic Games, finishing in fourth place at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Canada has also been part of two WBSC Premier12 tournaments, losing in the quarterfinals in 2015.\nWomen's national team.\nCanada competes in the Women's Baseball World Cup, a WBSC sanctioned events. The inaugural Women's Baseball World Cup was held in Edmonton. Their best results are a pair of runner-up finishes in 2008 and 2016.\nNational Baseball Team Programs.\nBaseball Canada's sole mission is \"dedicated, through collaborative leadership, to develop, promote and deliver ethical athlete centred programs which allow individuals to maximize their potential.\"\nFounded in 1999; the Junior National Team began an elite selection process in developing baseball players in North America. Canada Baseball organizes numerous teams composed of high school, college, and professional baseball players competing nationally and internationally.\nCanada Baseball also fields the Junior National Team featuring the best under-18 prospects. The Mizuno Elite Development Camp which selects the top under-16 prospects in Canada every September to play at the Rogers Centre, home of the Toronto Blue Jays; evaluated by top coaches in the country. Another event that takes place annually is the Baseball Canada Cup. This event takes place every August within Canada. The competition features the under-17 players from each of the 10 provinces in Canada contending for a national championship.\nThe final stage of the Junior National Team eventually leads to the World Junior Baseball Championship which takes place every other year. In the past this tour has included games against top collegiate summer teams, elite travel or club teams, and national teams from other countries both at the high school and college level. Since 1981, Canada has tallied one gold, one silver, and seven bronze medals with their most recent silver medal coming at the 2012 18U Baseball World Championship, held in Seoul, South Korea.\nThe Junior National Team has produced numerous players that have gone on to play professional and college baseball, along with players who have represented Canada in the World Baseball Classic, and also the Olympics. Some of these players include 2006 American League MVP Justin Morneau, 2004 National League Rookie of the Year Jason Bay, National League MVP Larry Walker and Joey Votto, first round picks Adam Loewen and Jeff Francis as well as current Major League Baseball players: Brett Lawrie, Russell Martin, Ryan Dempster, and John Axford.\nRBI Program (Reaching Baseball Ideals).\nThe program was created in 2008 in order to give local baseball associations across Canada the chance to apply for accreditation with the RBI Program. According to Baseball Canada, by becoming accredited through the RBI Program, an association gain credibility in their community. Parents signing their children up for baseball will be able to tell if the association they are signing up with is well-run and meets the high standards Baseball Canada sets for its programs. In order to apply for membership in the RBI Program, an association must at least meet the minimum standards in these five areas:\nIf an organization does not deal with young children (ages 5–8) and would still like to be a member of the program, they can gain membership through a points system that evaluates their association. They must meet at least 5 of the core criteria that Baseball Canada has set, a few of which are, having the Challenger Program for special needs children in place, a girls specific program, and hosting both umpire and coaches clinics. Based on how relevant each of these criteria are, the RBI Program awards the association points. If they meet the 5 necessary criteria but are awarded less than 10 points, they receive a bronze designation, if they are awarded 10-16 points they receive a silver designation, and if they are awarded 16-22 points they receive a gold designation.\nThe following associations have all received accreditation through the RBI Program:\nAlberta\nSaskatchewan\nManitoba\nNew Brunswick\nPrince Edward Island\nChallenger Program.\nBaseball Canada's Challenger Program is designed to ensure that children with special needs get the opportunity to participate in organized baseball. Whether they have mental or physical disabilities, children are given the opportunity to play at a level that is suited to their abilities. It is a safe, fun and positive environment where no score is kept, and each child is assigned their own personal \"buddy\" who aids them during a game. Whether it be learning the rules, aiding them around the base path, or teaching them how to play, these buddies help to ensure that each child has an enjoyable experience. Maintaining the team aspect of conventional baseball is a key part of this program, as is ensuring that each participant is treated the same way as they would be in a regular baseball program.\nBaseball Canada's website provides this list of objectives they hope to meet through their Challenger Program:\nTheir website also provides this list of benefits they feel families and children will receive from participating in this program:\nWinterball.\nOriginally a program that was launched by Baseball Ontario, and with the help of Baseball Canada, Major League Baseball and the Toronto Blue Jays, it has become a nationwide program that helps get kids (primarily aged 6–12) involved with baseball in a fun and easy way. The program is set up with schools and local communities and is free of charge. It contains simple and entertaining games that a child can play by themselves or in groups. These games are designed specifically for each age group and focus on developing the key skill sets used in baseball: hitting, throwing, and fielding. The non-competitive aspect of these games ensures that each child has fun and doesn't feel that baseball isn't for them if they don't succeed. In addition to the physical benefits of the program, Winterball also teaches children valuable social skills, such as how to play fair, how to play as a team, and proper etiquette.\nSome of the games included in the program are:"

        "text": "The women's figure skating competition at the 1956 Winter Olympics took place at the Olympic Ice Stadium in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. The competition was held on 30–31 January and 2 February 1956. Twenty-one women from eleven countries participated in the competition. The event was dominated by the American skaters and who won gold and silver. Tenley Albright, who overcame a significant injury two weeks before the start of the competition, was the Olympic champion.\nCompetition.\nThe event was held outdoors at the Ice Stadium in Cortina d'Ampezzo, the host city for the Games. This would be the last time that the figure skating events were held outdoors at an Olympic Games. The Ice Stadium was the focal point of the Games. It was used not only for figure skating but also for the opening and closing ceremonies. It was built to accommodate 6,000–7,000 people. Temporary seating was added for the figure skating competition that swelled the stadium's capacity to 14,000 people. The ladies' competition was the first figure skating event held at the Games. It was followed by the men's competition and then the pairs. Ice dancing had yet to become an Olympic sport in 1956.\nThe competition was broken down into two disciplines. The first was a compulsory figures competition, which counted for 60% of the score. This was done on 30 January, with the competition beginning in such a heavy snowstorm that it was difficult for the judges to see the skaters' tracings. After the first day of competition Tenley Albright had the lead with 9 of 11 judges' first-place ordinals, with Carol Heiss second.\nThe second discipline was a free skating program, which counted for 40% of the final score. This final program was performed on 2 February. In the second day of competition Albright edged out Heiss by 1.6 points to claim the gold medal.\nAlbright won the event despite a serious leg injury sustained just weeks before the Olympics. While skating in practice Albright fell when her skate hit a rut in the ice. Her left skate blade sliced her right ankle to the bone, severing a vein. She also had to overcome polio, which she contracted in 1946. Carol Heiss won the silver medal. She later won gold at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley, and married Hayes Jenkins, the men's champion at the 1956 Games. Ingrid Wendl from Austria won the bronze medal, the only Olympic medal of her career.\nResults.\nSource:"

        "text": "The RPI Engineers women's ice hockey team are a National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I women's college ice hockey program that represents Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). The Engineers are a member of the ECAC Hockey (ECACHL) conference. They play at the Houston Field House in Troy, New York.\nHistory.\nThe Engineers women's hockey program began for the 1995–96 season, playing at the NCAA Division III level in ECAC East. In their final season in Division III, the 2004–05 season, the Engineers qualified to the championship game of the ECAC East Tournament. It was their second consecutive season in the championship. That season, RPI had 21 wins, compared to only 6 losses and a league record of 17–2–0. In addition, the Engineers were ranked second in the nation in scoring defense (allowing only 1.22 goals per game). Nationally, the Engineers were fourth in power play percentage and eighth in scoring offense. The star of the team was sophomore Julie Aho. She was selected as an AHCA National All-America, and led the team in scoring in each of her first two seasons.\nIn 2005–06, RPI was a Division I independent. The club won 18 games, lost 6 and tied 2. During that season, the team notched wins over Colgate, Northeastern, Connecticut and Boston University. Despite being an independent, the Engineers were ranked fourth in the NCAA in winning percentage (.731) and seventh in scoring offense (3.23 goals per game average). Senior goaltender Rosina Schiff would become the program's all-time leader in wins with 40 (since broken) and games played with 65 (since broken).\nRensselaer joined the ECAC for the 2006–07 season. In its second season in the ECAC (2007–08), Rensselaer won 13 games, compared to 15 losses and 5 ties and a conference record of 6–12–4. The Engineers matched the single season record for ties, including its first-ever point over then nationally ranked Dartmouth in a 1–1 draw in Hanover.\nThe record for most wins at the NCAA Division I level in one season is 19, which was set in 2008–09 (19–14–4). The overall program record is 21, set in 2004–05, the team's last year at the Division III level. The Engineers made NCAA history on February 28, 2010, beating Quinnipiac 2–1 in five overtime periods. Senior defenseman Laura Gersten had the game-winning goal. She registered it at 4:32 of the fifth overtime session to not only clinch the win, but the series victory. It is now the second longest college hockey game in NCAA history, surpassed a few weeks later on March 12, 2010, in a men's hockey contest between Quinnipiac beat Union.\nDuring the 2010–11 season, the Engineers boasted one statistic that no other Division I team in the country could: three Alaskan players on its current roster. Amanda Castignetti is from Anchorage (and attended Shattuck St-Mary's in Minnesota), Jordan Smelker, a freshman from Anchorage, and Nona Letuligasenoa (attended the North American Hockey Academy in Stowe, Vermont) were the three players in question.\nEngineers in Pro Hockey.\nAs of autumn 2016, there were six Engineers alumnae who had competed in professional women's ice hockey. The list of players includes Whitey Naslund (Class of 2010), Sonja van der Bliek (Class of 2011), Andie LeDonne (Class of 2013), Delaney Middlebrook and Jordan Smelker (Class of 2015) and Alexa Gruschow (Class of 2016).\nNaslund would play for the CWHL's Boston Blades under head coach Digit Murphy, capturing a Clarkson Cup championship in 2013. LeDonne and van der Bliek also competed in the CWHL, with van der Bliek taking on goaltender roles with the Brampton Thunder and Toronto Furies. Middlebrook would compete with Riksserien in the Swedish Elite League.\nBoth Isobel Cup champions, Smelker was a member of the Boston Pride roster that captured the NWHL's inaugural championship in 2016. As a side note, Smelker also won a Clarkson Cup in 2015 with the CWHL's Boston Blades. Winning the NWHL regular season scoring title in 2018, Gruschow was MVP of the Isobel Cup Finals in the same year, hoisting the Cup with the Metropolitan Riveters.\nYear by year.\nAfter transitioning the program to the Division I level, Burke served as head coach for 11 more seasons before being fired in June, 2017. Bryan Vines was named interim head coach later that month and took the helm beginning with the 2017–18 season. \nPlayers.\n2022–23 roster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nNotable players.\nAs of the end of the 2009–10 season, Sonja van der Bliek was RPI's single season record holder in numerous categories: most games played (84), most games started (83), most wins (42–31–11), most minutes played (5161:36), most saves (1922) and most shutouts (16). In the 2017–18 season, junior goaltender Lovisa Selander overtook van der Bliek as the all-time leader in career saves. She enters her senior season in 2018–19 with 2,935 career stops."

        "text": "Loudmouth Golf is an American sportswear company based in Sonoma County, California, known for colorful trousers.\nThe company was established in 2000 by Scott \"Woody\" Woodworth, then a graphic designer. His first design involved a children's fabric with prints of Warner Brothers cartoon characters, which he had made by a local seamstress. The designs caught the attention of various sports personalities, who began ordering the pants. In 2007 Woodworth began creating his own fabric designs.\nIn 2009 golfer John Daly appeared wearing \"loud\" clothing from the company on the European Tour while banned from the PGA Tour. Daly later entered a formal endorsement agreement with the company. \nThe Norwegian curling team drew international attention to the company, and to themselves, at the 2010 Winter Olympics by wearing Loudmouth's \"Dixie-A\" pants with red, white, and blue diamonds as a uniform. The team wore the pants on advice from second Chris Svae who served as their fashion consultant. The team gave a pair to King Harald V of Norway. A Facebook fan page created for Norway's pants drew more than 500,000 fans during the games. During the Olympics, Loudmouth's web traffic increased by a factor of ten and sales tripled."

        "text": "The Cornell Big Red women's ice hockey program represents Cornell University and participates in Division I collegiate hockey in the ECAC Hockey conference. They play at the Lynah Rink in Ithaca, New York. \nThe Ivy League announced in July 2020 that they would suspend play for all sports, including women's ice hockey, in the Fall 2020, due to the Coronavirus outbreak. Athletics resumed in fall of 2021.\nHistory.\nThe Cornell women's hockey program was started in 1971. It would only be in 1972 that the team would play its first game; it was a 4–3 victory over Scarborough. In 1972, they played eight games and lost four. In addition, the Big Red lost twice to the Pandas's program.\nIn 1976, Brown hosted the first ever Ivy League women's ice hockey tournament. Cornell bested Brown, Princeton and Yale to win the tournament.\nOn March 7, 2010, sophomore Kendice Ogilvie beat Clarkson goaltender Lauren Dahm at 7:52 mark in overtime. With the victory, Cornell won its first ECAC Tournament, and earns its first trip to the NCAA Frozen Four.\nOn March 13, 2010, Cornell defeated the Crimson by a score of 6–2 to earn its first ever trip to the NCAA Frozen Four. At the 2010 Frozen Four championship game, Cornell goaltender Amanda Mazzotta set a record for most saves in an NCAA Championship game with 61 saves. The former record holder was Bulldog goaltender Patricia Sautter. She had the old record of 41 set in 2003.\nOn January 7 and 8, 2011, Cornell freshman goaltender Lauren Slebodnik earned two shutouts in her first two career starts. On January 7, she made her NCAA debut by shutting out Yale by a 5–0 margin. With Cornell dressing just 12 skaters, she stopped all 23 Yale shots. The following night, Slebodnik shut out the Brown Bears by a 3–0 mark. Cornell only dressed 11 skaters for the game and she stopped all 15 shots.\nIn Jillian Saulnier's college debut versus the Colgate Raiders on October 25, she netted four goals. In her first three career NCAA games, she registered ten points (seven goals, three assists), along with a +6 rating. Her four-goal night was the first for Cornell since Jessica Campbell scored four against Robert Morris in the second game of the 2010–11 season. She scored her first career goal when she was out on the Big Red's first power play of the game. In her next game versus the Yale Bulldogs, she registered one goal and two assists, while scoring two goals in her third game versus the Brown Bears squad. For the month of October 2011, she was tied for first in the ECAC in goals scored (while the other player appeared in eight games). In a game on November 1, 2011, the Cornell Big Red scored at least nine goals in one game for the third consecutive contest. It was senior captain Chelsea Karpenko's 100th career game, as Saulnier led all Big Red players with two goals and three assists in a 9–2 triumph over the Syracuse Orange.\nThe Big Red had a standout year in 2019, finishing the season atop the standings in the ECAC. They lost in the ECAC championship game against Clarkson.\nIn 2020, Cornell finished first in the ECAC for the second year in a row, with an undefeated season in conference play at 19-0-3 ( 28-2-3 overall). They dominated the league and had an unbeaten streak of 22 games from November 30, 2019 to March 7, 2020. The Big Red easily won their 15th Ivy League championship. In the ECAC tournament, Cornell beat perennial rival Harvard Crimson in the semi-final by a score of 4-0. In a surprising upset in the championship game, they lost in overtime to the Princeton Tigers by a score of 3-2. Jessie Eldridge finished the season fourth in the ECAC in points, with 43, followed by her teammate Kristin O'Neil, who tallied 41 points on the year. Izzy Daniel won Ivy League Rookie of the Year. Lindsay Browning, the Big Red's junior goalie, won Ivy League Player of the Year honors, and the MAC Goaltending Goalie of the Year. Jaime Bourbonnais won Ivy League Best Defenseman honors, and was selected as a First Team All-American. Head Coach Doug Derraugh was recognized with two Coach of the Year awards: the Ivy League Coach of the Year (his fourth in a row) and the ECAC Hockey Coach of the Year (second in a row). \nCornell earned a berth in the 2020 NCAA women's ice hockey tournament, but the event was cancelled due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic. In July 2020, the Ivy League announced there would be no league play in the fall of 2020, due to continuing concerns about health. Cornell, along with fellow Ivy League teams Harvard, Brown, Dartmouth, Princeton and Yale, resumed athletics in the fall of 2021. \nThe new Toronto Six Women's National Hockey League team signed Cornell alumna Amy Curlew in 2020.\nYear by year.\nIvy League Champions: (15) 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981*, 1990, 1996, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013*, 2017, 2018, 2020, 2024\n\"* denotes shared title\"\nRoster.\n2022–23 Big Red.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nAwards and honors.\nAll-Americans.\nLindsay Browning, 2019-20 CCM Hockey Women's Division I All-American: Second Team"

It eliminates the need for golfers to carry or push their own clubs or hiring a caddie, and can require much less effort to push around than a manual push or pull trolley.\nThe first use of an electric golf trolley was on a golf course was by JK Wadley of Texarkana, Texas/Arkansas, who saw a three-wheeled electric cart being used in Los Angeles to transport senior citizens to the grocery store. Electric golf trolleys were introduced into the United Kingdom by Joe Catford, who established the company Powakaddy in 1983. Having sold Powakaddy in the early 1990s, Catford went on to found HillBilly, another company specializing in electric golf trolleys."

        "title": "List of Olympic medalists in baseball",
        "text": "Baseball is a sport formerly contested at the Summer Olympic Games. It was originally played as a demonstration sport in seven Olympics—1912, 1936, 1952, 1956, 1964, 1984, and 1988— more than for any other sport in Olympic history. These exhibitions featured a single game at the first five Olympic appearances and then a tournament format in 1984 and 1988. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) granted baseball official status on October 13, 1986, for the 1992 Summer Olympics. The sport was contested at each subsequent Games through 2008, after which the IOC removed it from the roster of Olympic sports.\nIn 1992, the first official Olympic baseball tournament was won by the Cuban team. Cuba had boycotted the 1984 and 1988 Olympics, missing the previous exhibition baseball tournaments, but entered in 1992 as the favorite, having won the past 12 world championships and with a 62–1 record in international competitions since 1986. The Cubans went undefeated in the 1992 Olympics and trailed in only one game. They went undefeated again at the 1996 Olympics en route to a second consecutive gold medal. The United States won their first medal (bronze) in the 1996 Olympics and then won gold at the 2000 Summer Olympics. 2000 was the first Olympics in which Cuba lost a game: first to the Dutch team in round-robin play and then again to the Americans in the gold medal game. This was also the first time professional players were allowed to compete in baseball, though Major League Baseball (MLB) did not permit any player on the 40-man roster of an MLB team to compete. In 2004, the reigning gold medalist United States did not qualify for the Olympic tournament, while the Cuban team won its third gold medal.\nIn 2005, the IOC investigated the addition of sports to the Olympic schedule including golf, rugby sevens, and karate. The IOC voted on July 8, 2005 to remove baseball and softball from the 2012 Summer Olympics roster, the first sports removed from the Olympics since polo in 1936. A variety of factors were cited for removing baseball including the absence of MLB players, problems with performance-enhancing drugs, and the high cost of constructing a baseball stadium. Appeals to reinstate both sports for 2012 were rejected. Baseball was still played at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, however, and the South Korean team beat Cuba to claim their first gold medal in the event. The international governing bodies of several sports, including baseball, petitioned the IOC in 2009 to fill two sport slots at the 2016 Olympics. IOC President Jacques Rogge said they were \"looking for an added value – wide appeal, especially for young people.\" The IOC ultimately voted to fill the two available slots for 2016 with rugby and golf. However, the IOC ultimately approved the return of baseball and softball to the Olympic program for the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo in 2016.\nBaseball was open only to male amateurs in 1992 and 1996. As a result, the Americans and other nations where professional baseball is developed relied on collegiate players, while Cubans used their most experienced veterans, who technically were considered amateurs as they nominally held other jobs, but in fact trained full-time. In 2000, pros were admitted, but MLB refused to release its players in 2000, 2004, and 2008, and the situation changed only a little: the Cubans still used their best players, while the Americans started using minor leaguers. The IOC cited the absence of the best players as the main reason for baseball being dropped from the Olympic program.\nCuba has been the most successful team, winning the most gold and silver medals and never finishing outside the podium. Cuban pitcher Pedro Luis Lazo is the most successful individual athlete, winning four medals—two gold and two silver—from 1996 to 2008. No American ever appeared in the Olympics more than once. Nine other Cuban players won three medals; no player from any other nation accomplished this feat. From the 25 athletes who won two medals in baseball, 18 were Cuban, while the remaining seven included 4 South Korean and 3 Japanese players.\nAthlete medal leaders.\nAthletes who won at least two gold medals or three total medals are listed below."

Hunter is one [of] the most erratic half-backs I ever saw, and, when cornered, occasionally loses his head. It is months, I must admit, since I saw him perform, and perhaps he has improved vastly in the interval, but that he is to International form is what I cannot get myself to believe. His antecedents are as fresh in my mind as those of the most modern crack half-back, and, consequently, I may be permitted to speak of his abilities with some little authority.\"\nInternational career.\nOne of the earliest Scottish players, he was capped once for in 1882 against .\nHis selection caused a stir:- although he had a good reputation in the past, others were in form; and he was a current member of the Scottish Rugby Union committee. This led to comments from the \"Athletic News\" of 1 February 1882: \"But there is different story to be told of Frank Hunter, the other half-back. This University man was voted into the team because he had a past reputation. But have all old players not past reputations, and past reputations, too, of greater account than that Hunter. I have no desire to be unnecessarily heavy upon Hunter, for he is a gentleman for whom I have the profoundest respect, but I think when a team such as the Scotch Fifteen comes to be chosen, personal consideration and what is euphemistically termed past reputation should be cast aside altogether. Besides, Frank Hunter is a member of the Union Committee; and, if I am not mistaken, there is a rule which prohibits committee men playing in these big matches. A very bad precedent has been established, and the Union, it now exists, is entirely at fault.\"\nCricket career.\nHe played cricket for the Edinburgh University side; and in 1880 he captained the side.\nHe was a notable bowler and after university played for The Grange club in Edinburgh.\nHe also played for the Scotland national cricket team.\nLaw career.\nHe studied law at the University of Edinburgh.\nHe became a lawyer and was a Writer to the Signet.\nHis uncle was a solicitor and after graduating he entered his uncle's firm Hunter, Blair and Cowan solicitors; which later became the firm of E.A. &amp; F. Hunter.\nHe became a Commissioner for the Earl of Ailsa.\nFamily.\nHis parents were Alexander McLean Hunter (1821-1892) and Eliza Anna Bostock (1830-1902). Alexander was from Edinburgh; Eliza from Vaucluse in Tasmania. They married in Melbourne, Australia on 5 September 1850. They had 6 children, 3 boys and 3 girls.\nHe was sent to Scotland to be schooled; and he then stayed with his uncle Evan Allan Hunter in Newark Castle, Ayr.\nFrank married Elizabeth Agnes Mein-Austin (1866-1929), a girl from St. Mungo in Dumfries in Scotland, in Williamstown, Victoria in Australia. They settled back in Scotland and had 3 sons: Evan, Ronald and Wilfrid. Evan became the secretary of the British Olympic Association.\nHe died at Lockerbie. He had 2 residences: one at Dixons in Lockerbie; the other at 7 York Place, Edinburgh. The value of his estate at death was recorded as £7827, 13 shillings and 7 pence. Hunter had 2 wills; one made in 1894 and another made in 1931 – the eik was granted in 1934 to allow his sons to administer his estate.

He played three times for the North and forty-three times for the County. Joe was member of the Cumberland Cup winning side in 1899 and again ten years later. Joe was an outstanding sportsman who also excelled at cricket, boxing and athletics. He met an untimely death on 8 October 1910, when along with his brother George was buried alive in the family sand quarry.

Rugby Bundesliga is the top level of domestic club rugby union competition in Austria.\nHistory.\nThe competition was first contested in 1992, with RC Wien as the first champions.\nFor the 1993/1994 season, the four strongest Austrian teams competed with two Slovenian teams in the \"Alpenliga\" (Alps League), which replaced the \"Bundesliga\". This arrangement was repeated in the 1994/1995 season, with three Austrian teams playing against two Slovenian teams and RK Sisak from Croatia.\nThe 1995/1996 season was the first time 1. and 2. \"Bundesligen\" were played, but reverted to a single league for all clubs in 1996/1997 because of the progress made by the newer clubs. The difference in playing standards were however too large, and the following two seasons saw three of the Viennese clubs - RC Wien, Vienna Celtic, and RC Lycee - take on three Czech clubs in the Austro-Moravian League. This meant that the remaining clubs battled it out for the \"Bundesliga\".\nCurrent teams.\n2019-20 season\nResults.\n\"The scores in blue are links to accounts of finals on the site of the Austrian Rugby Federation (ÖRV) - in German \"\nPerformance by club.\nRegions.\nThe following table lists the Austrian rugby champions by region."

They were members of the Western Collegiate Hockey Association (WCHA) and competed in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I women ice hockey.\nThe program was cut by the University of North Dakota on March 29, 2017.\nHistory.\nOn October 5, 2010, North Dakota was ranked 10th in the Uscho.com poll. It was only the second time in program history that the club was in the top 10 in either the USA Today or Uscho.com poll. The last time came during the 2008–09 season after a 7–2–1 start. On October 23, 2010, Jocelyne Lamoureux had a hat trick and one assist. In addition, one of her goals was the game-winning goal. The hat trick was the first by a North Dakota player since Cami Wooster in 2005. On February 25–27, North Dakota participated in its first WCHA First Round Home Playoff Series, vs. Bemidji State at Fido Purpur Arena. On February 27, the Sioux advanced to their first WCHA Final Face-off berth winning an overtime thriller 3–2 in OT with a goal by Monique Lamoureux.\nIn its WCHA home opener on October 21, 2011, the top line of the Fighting Sioux combined for thirteen points as they bested the Ohio State Buckeyes by an 11–1 margin. Monique Lamoureux-Kolls tied a North Dakota record with a 5-point game. In the contest, 13 different Sioux skaters registered at least one point. Michelle Karvinen scored a hat trick and logged one assist for four points. In addition, Josefine Jakobsen and Jocelyne Lamoureux each had 4-point games. Several program records were broken in the game including: most goals scored in a game (11), largest margin of victory (10), and largest margin of victory over a conference opponent (10).\nOn March 29, 2017, the University of North Dakota announced it was cutting women's hockey – along with men's and women's swimming and diving – to meet a mandated $1.3M reduction in the athletics department budget that was part of a university-wide budget cut. Following the decision to drop the program, 11 ex-UND players filed a complaint claiming that dropping the program violated Title IX guidelines. The U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights dismissed two discrimination complaints related to the decision and on June 20, 2019, a U.S. District Court judge dismissed a lawsuit against the school brought on similar grounds."

        "text": "John Carter Brennan (September 28, 1913 – March 1982) was an American football player. He played at the guard position for the University of Michigan from 1936 to 1938 and for the Green Bay Packers in 1939.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nBrennan was born in Racine, Wisconsin, and attended Carl Schurz High School in the Irving Park neighborhood of Chicago, Illinois. Although he stood six feet, two inches and weighed 200 pounds, he was reportedly \"the smallest man in his family in three generations.\"\nUniversity of Michigan.\nBrennan enrolled at the University of Michigan in 1935 where he became a member of the school's football and wrestling teams. He played guard for the Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1936 to 1938.\nAs a sophomore in 1936, Brennan was a starter for Harry Kipke's football team that finished the season with a record of 1–6. At the end of the 1936 season, Brennan sparked a controversy when the Associated Press reported that he responded to a questionnaire about women students by saying that \"four out of five co-eds are beautiful, and the fifth one comes to Michigan.\" The comment led one female Michigan student to reply with a slap at the football team, stating that, \"Four out of five men are football players, and the fifth one comes to Michigan.\"\nAfter the poor showing in 1936, Brennan was one of the players who helped turn the program around in 1938 under new head coach Fritz Crisler. Brennan and All-American Ralph Heikkinen started every game at the two guard positions for the 1938 team—a team that finished with a 6–1–1 record and featured All-Americans Tom Harmon and Forest Evashevski in the backfield.\nThe controversy over Brennan's comments about Michigan's female students followed him into his senior year. In January 1939, he was voted the \"queen\" of the university's ice festival. The Associated Press picked up the story, which was printed in newspapers across the United States under headlines such as \"Campus Beauty Weighs 201 Pounds and Are Coeds Piqued\" and \"Step Up and Take a Bow Miss Brennan\". The AP story reported on the vote as follows:\"Lantern-jawed John Brennan, 201-pound varsity football player and wrestler, was chosen 'queen' of the University of Michigan ice carnival in a campus outbreak of monkey-shining today. ... Brennan himself started a campus battle two years ago by observing that 'four out of five women are pretty, and the fifth comes to Michigan.' Campus aesthetes described Brennan a clipped blond of the type known as statuesque (reinforced concrete, chiseled with a blow torch).\"\nSports columnist, Henry J. McCormick, also picked up the story and wrote that the selection of the football player and heavyweight wrestler as queen of the ice carnival was the result of \"skulduggery\" in the balloting, which was traced to Brennan's earlier \"direct slap at the pulchritude of Michigan's co-eds,\" a slap that spawned a campus squabble and \"made for some very fine reading in the campus newspaper.\"\nProfessional football.\nBrennan was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the 19th round (179th overall pick) of the 1939 NFL Draft. When Brennan signed with the Packers in February 1939, the story was reported under the headline, \"'QUEEN' OF MICHIGAN SIGNED BY GREEN BAY\". When Brennan showed up at Curly Lambeau's training camp, the press continued to refer to him as \"the Michigan 'Ice Queen.'\" Although official records indicate that Brennan appeared in only two games for the Packers during the 1939 NFL season, newspaper accounts indicate that he appeared in at least three games—as a starter in the Packers' 31–0 win over the St. Louis Gunners on October 15, 1939, and as a substitute in a 27–20 win over the Chicago Cardinals on October 8, 1939, and a 26–7 win over the Detroit Lions on October 22, 1939. Brennan was released by the Packers in October 1939 and signed with the Kenosha Cardinals of the American Pro Football League. In November 1939, Brennan was added to the Kenosha coaching staff and also continued as a player.\nLater years.\nBrennan died in 1982 at age 62 while living in Fort Pierce, FL."

        "title": "Around the world sailing record",
        "text": "The first around the world sailing record for circumnavigation of the world can be attributed to the surviving crew of Ferdinand Magellan's expedition, including the last captain Juan Sebastián Elcano who completed their journey in 1522. \nAlthough not in a single voyage but Magellan was technically the first to circumnavigate the globe since he was killed in the Mactan Islands and while in the Kingdom of Portugal's service, Magellan had already reached the Malay Archipelago in Southeast Asia on previous voyages traveling east (from 1505 to 1511–1512). By visiting this area again but now traveling west, Magellan achieved a nearly complete personal circumnavigation of the globe for the first time in history.\nThe first solo record was set by Joshua Slocum in the \"Spray\" (1898).\nThe current record holders are IDEC 3, skippered by Francis Joyon in 40 days, 23 hours, 30 minutes and 30 seconds for a crewed journey, and François Gabart with Macif in 42 days, 16 hours, 40 minutes and 35 seconds for a solo journey.\nMost races or solo attempts start from Europe. Due to the configuration of the continents, sailing around the world consists of sailing on the Southern Ocean around the Antarctica continent, passing south of Cape Horn, Cape of Good Hope and Cape Leeuwin. Since 1918 the Panama Canal is an option but the locks must be entered and exited using engine power. Large stretches of the canal can be crossed under sail power.\nSailing around the world can be done by two directions: eastward or westward. The dominant winds and currents (outside tropical areas) make the voyage eastwards on the Southern hemisphere faster, most skippers and yachts who race prefer this route. Today, the multihulls perform much better than monohulls and hold the best times. Leisure yacht skippers who prefer tropical seas more often go westward, using the trade winds (and the Panama canal). The Jules Verne Trophy is awarded for the fastest qualifying circumnavigation, starting from an imaginary line between the Créac'h lighthouse on Ushant island, France, and the Lizard Lighthouse, UK.\nThe records are homologated by the World Sailing Speed Record Council (WSSRC). WSSRC rules state that qualifying round-the-world voyages must be at least 21,600 nmi long, calculated along the shortest possible track from the starting port and back that does not cross land and does not go below 63°S. The great-circle distance formulas are to be used, assuming that the great circle length is 21,600 nmi. It is allowed to have one single waypoint to lengthen the calculated track. The equator must be crossed. In reality, this means that the boat should pass a waypoint at or not far from the antipode of the starting port of the journey (the exact position depends on how short the shortest possible track is). For example, the Vendée Globe starts at 46°N 2°W, has a waypoint at 57°S 180°E, and barely makes the distance requirement. The participants don't have to go to the antipode at 46°S 178°E since the rounding of Africa gives extra distance.\nNotable races.\nThe most famous races around the world are:\nFormer races including:\nNotable solo achievements.\nFrom the first round-the-world yacht race (Sunday Times Golden Globe Race) in 1968, to November 2020, around 200 sailors tried their luck in a monohull and less than 100 managed to complete the course, mainly in the context of the Vendée Globe.\nOnly 6 sailors achieved the Westward route facing the dominant winds and currents.\nOnly 4 sailors managed to complete a round-the-world tour in a single-handed multihull without stopover and without assistance:\nOnly 3 sailors have raced non-stop solo around the world in both directions. Mike Golding and Dee Caffari both set WSSRC Westbound world records using Global Challenge boats and also finishing the Eastbound Vendee Globe Race. In 2018 Jean-Luc Van Den Heede also managed this achievement.\nEastward route.\nNon-stop Longest Distance Sailed.\nRecognised by the Guinness Book of Records\nSinglehanded Female.\nThe following voyages were pioneers and not officially recognized by the WSSRC.\nWestward route.\nThis route is the more demanding one, as it faces the dominant winds and currents.

He was named second-team All-Conference in football as a junior and first-team All-Conference his senior year.\nCollege Football.\nHe matriculated at Kansas State where he walked on to the football team as a wide receiver. He became a four-year starter as a cornerback and kickoff returner, although he redshirted his sophomore season due to injury. As a senior in 1982, Best was named to the All-Big Eight Conference team.\nHe was invited to play in the Blue–Gray Football Classic all-star game following his senior season in 1982. He caught two interceptions in the game and was named the game's defensive MVP.\nProfessional Football.\nBest went undrafted in the 1983 NFL Draft, but was signed shortly after the draft by the Pittsburgh Steelers. He spent training camp with the team, but was among the final roster cuts. The Steelers re-signed Best after the third game of the 1983 season when Eric Williams was placed on the injured reserve list due to an ankle injury.\nHe played primarily as a special teamer with the Steelers with occasional reps at safety in passing situations. Best's finest performance as a pro came in week seven of 1983 against the rival Cleveland Browns. In that game Best made three tackles in the kicking game, caused an incompletion with a hit on Ozzie Newsome on defense and returned a fumble 94 yards for the game's final score. That 94-yard fumble recovery return was the longest of the season in the NFL.\nBest was once again released by the Steelers prior to the 1984 season. He was picked up by the Browns, for whom he played five games in 1984. He later signed with the Memphis Showboats of the United States Football League (USFL), but the league folded before he had a chance to play. His bad luck continued when he signed with the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League only to see that team also fold before he could join them.\nBest finished his playing career in 1988 after stints with the Pittsburgh Gladiators and the New York Knights of the Arena Football League.\nPost-football career.\nSince leaving football, Best has worked as a general contractor. He has also had an ownership interest in a sports bar in Cranberry Township, Pennsylvania.\nPersonal.\nBest married Donna Wickline in 1982. They have since divorced."

It has won numerous national, British Empire Games, Commonwealth, World and Olympic titles, with four club members winning five Olympic gold medals.\nA current \"West Ender\" is Mahé Drysdale, five time Single Scull World Champion and Olympic gold medallist.\nHistory.\nThe West End Rowing Club was founded in Ponsonby in 1884, with training taking place in St Mary's Bay (now Westhaven). Success came early to the Club with the first regatta win being recorded in 1885. As the city of Auckland developed so did West End with the growing in numbers and successes over the early decades of the twentieth century. Even the destruction of virtually all of the Club's boats in a cyclone which struck Auckland in 1914 where large seas flooded the boathouse was overcome.\nIn 1949 the club won its first red-coat (premier title) with victory in the premier eight on Lake Karapiro. The crew included: Don Rowlands, Donald Adam, Murray Ashby, Kerry Ashby, Bruce Culpan, Thomas Engel, Grahame Jarratt, Edwin Smith and Bill Tinnock. This entire crew was selected as the New Zealand eight for the 1950 Empire Games where they finished a close second, only a foot behind the gold medallists, Australia.\nAfter this first redcoat the 1950s–70s were a golden era for West End Rowing Club with the club winning a 47 redcoats and two Olympic gold medals. West End Rowing Club celebrated its centenary in 1984 with a premier title and another Olympic gold.\nAfter 115 years based at St Mary's Bay the club moved out to the Whau River in Avondale due to redevelopment at Westhaven. Helen Clark officially opened the new clubhouse in October 2001.\nWest End Rowing Club celebrated its 125th anniversary in 2009.\nWest End sent its national championship eight from 2010 to race at the Henley Royal Regatta in the same year. With two replacements, they managed to get into the final of the Thames Challenge Cup on their first time. Mahé Drysdale also reclaimed his title in the Diamond Sculls at the same regatta.\nOlympians.\nDudley Storey won the club's first Olympic gold medal at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City in the coxed four. Four years later Tony Hurt won another for the club when he stroked the New Zealand men's eight to victory in Munich. Shane O'Brien won a gold medal at the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles in the men's coxless four.\nMahé Drysdale won gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics in the single scull.

Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in U.S. team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889. The 2010 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans are honorary lists that include All-American selections from the Associated Press (AP), the United States Basketball Writers Association (USBWA), the \"Sporting News\" (TSN), and the National Association of Basketball Coaches (NABC) for the 2009–10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season. All selectors choose at least a first and second 5-man team. The NABC and AP choose third teams, and TSN chooses third, fourth and fifth teams, while AP also lists honorable mention selections.\nThe Consensus 2010 College Basketball All-American team is determined by aggregating the results of the four major All-American teams as determined by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). Since United Press International was replaced by TSN in 1997, the four major selectors have been the aforementioned ones. AP has been a selector since 1948, NABC since 1957 and USBWA since 1960. To earn \"consensus\" status, a player must win honors based on a point system computed from the four different all-America teams. The point system consists of three points for first team, two points for second team and one point for third team. No honorable mention or fourth team or lower are used in the computation. The top five totals plus ties are first team and the next five plus ties are second team. According to this system, Sherron Collins, Wesley Johnson, Scottie Reynolds, Evan Turner and John Wall were first team selections and Cole Aldrich, James Anderson, DeMarcus Cousins, Luke Harangody, Jon Scheyer and Greivis Vasquez were second team selections.\nAlthough the aforementioned lists are used to determine consensus honors, there are numerous other All-American lists. The ten finalists for the John Wooden Award are described as Wooden All-Americans. The ten finalists for the Lowe's Senior CLASS Award are described as Senior All-Americans.

        "title": "Hat-trick (cricket)",
        "text": "In cricket, a hat-trick occurs when a bowler takes three wickets. The deliveries may be interrupted by an over bowled by another bowler from the other end of the pitch or the other team's innings, but must be three consecutive deliveries by the individual bowler in the same match. Only wickets attributed to the bowler count towards a hat-trick; run outs do not count, although they can contribute towards a so-called team hat-trick, which is ostensibly a normal hat-trick except that the three successive deliveries can be wickets from any bowler in the team and with any mode of dismissal.\nHat-tricks are rare, and as such are treasured by bowlers.\nThe term is also sometimes used to mean winning the same competition three times in a row. For example, Australia winning the Cricket World Cup in 1999, 2003 and 2007, and Lancashire winning the County Championship in 1926, 1927 and 1928.\nTest cricket.\nIn Test cricket history there have been just 46 hat-tricks, the first achieved by Fred Spofforth for Australia against England in 1879. In 1912, Australian Jimmy Matthews achieved the feat twice in one game against South Africa. The only other players to achieve two hat-tricks are Australia's Hugh Trumble, against England in 1902 and 1904, Pakistan's Wasim Akram, in separate games against Sri Lanka in 1999, and England's Stuart Broad in 2011 and 2014.\nNuwan Zoysa of Sri Lanka is the First bowler to achieve a hat-trick with his first three balls in a Test, against Zimbabwe in 1999. Irfan Pathan of India achieved a hat-trick in the first over of a Test match against Pakistan.\nAustralian fast bowler Peter Siddle took a hat-trick in an Ashes Test match against England on 25 November 2010, Siddle's 26th birthday.\nOne Day Internationals.\nIn One Day International cricket there have been 50 hat-tricks, the first by Jalal-ud-Din for Pakistan against Australia in 1982, and the most recent player to achieve this feat is Wesley Madhevere of Zimbabwe against the Netherlands in March 2023.\nSri Lanka's Lasith Malinga is the only bowler to take three hat-tricks in a single form of international cricket with his three in ODIs. Four players have taken at least two ODI hat-tricks in their careers: Wasim Akram and Saqlain Mushtaq of Pakistan, Chaminda Vaas of Sri Lanka and Kuldeep Yadav of India. (Akram therefore has four international hat-tricks in total).\nChaminda Vaas is the only player to achieve a hat-trick with the first three deliveries in a One Day International, against Bangladesh in the tenth match of 2003 ICC World Cup at City Oval, Pietermaritzburg. He also took a fourth wicket with the fifth ball of the same over, just missing the double hat-trick (read the section \"More than three dismissals\" below for more information).\nT20 Internationals.\nAs of 14 April 2024, there have been 58 hat-tricks in T20Is.\nThe first Twenty20 hat-trick was taken by Brett Lee of Australia, playing against Bangladesh in Cape Town in September 2007. Lasith Malinga is the only bowler with multiple T20I hat-tricks. His first hat-trick was achieved against Bangladesh in 2017 and his second hat-trick occurred in September 2019 against New Zealand.\nRashid Khan, Lasith Malinga, Curtis Campher and Jason Holder are the only bowlers to take four wickets in four balls in T20Is, Khan achieving this feat against Ireland in February 2019, and Malinga repeating the achievement against New Zealand in September 2019. On 18 October 2021 at 2021 ICC Men's T20 World Cup, Campher achieved the feat against the Netherlands On 30 January 2022, Holder achieved this feat against England.\nOn 6 August 2021, Nathan Ellis picked up three wickets off the last three balls of Bangladesh innings to become the first male cricketer to take a hat-trick on his debut in a T20I match.\nUnusual hat-tricks.\nSome hat-tricks are particularly extraordinary. On 2 December 1988, Merv Hughes, playing for Australia, dismissed Curtly Ambrose with the last ball of his penultimate over and Patrick Patterson with the first ball of his next over, wrapping up the West Indies first innings. When Hughes returned to bowl in the West Indies second innings, he trapped Gordon Greenidge lbw with his first ball, completing a hat-trick over two different innings and becoming the only player in Test cricket history to achieve the three wickets of a hat-trick in three different overs.\nIn 1844, underarm bowler William Clarke, playing for \"England\" against Kent, achieved a hat-trick spread over two innings, dismissing Kent batsman John Fagge twice within the hat-trick. Fagge batted at number 11 in the first innings and at number 3 in the second. This was repeated by Shankar Saini of Delhi against Himachal Pradesh in 1988/89, when he dismissed Shakti Singh twice as part of his hat-trick.\nThe most involved hat-trick was perhaps when Melbourne club cricketer Stephen Hickman, playing for Power House in March 2002, achieved a hat-trick spread over three overs, two days, two innings, involving the same batsman twice, and observed by the same non-striker, with the hat-trick ball being bowled from the opposite end to the first two. In the Mercantile Cricket Association C-Grade semi-final at Fawkner Park, South Yarra, Gunbower United Cricket Club were 8 for 109 when Hickman came on to bowl his off spin. He took a wicket with the last ball of his third over and then bowled number 11 batsman Richard Higgins with the first ball of his next over to complete the Gunbower innings, leaving Chris Taylor the not out batsman. Power House scored 361, putting the game out of reach of Gunbower. In the second innings, opener Taylor was joined by Higgins at the fall of the fourth wicket as Hickman returned to the attack. With his first ball, observed by an incredulous Taylor at the non-striker's end, he clean bowled Higgins, leaving Higgins with a pair of golden ducks.\nMore than three dismissals.\nThe feat of taking four wickets in four balls has never occurred in Test cricket, and only once in One Day International cricket, in the 2007 World Cup, when Lasith Malinga managed the feat against South Africa. Malinga then repeated this triumph in a T20I against New Zealand during their 2019 tour of Sri Lanka. Afghanistan's Rashid Khan, Ireland's Curtis Campher and West Indian Jason Holder took four wickets in four balls in T20Is, against Ireland, Netherlands and England respectively. \nIt has also occurred on other occasions in first-class cricket. Kevan James of Hampshire took four wickets in four balls and scored a century in the same county game against India in 1996. The Cricinfo report on the game claimed that this was unique in cricket. It is sometimes claimed that the first cricketer to achieve this feat was Joseph Wells (father of novelist H. G. Wells): in 1862 he dismissed Sussex's James Dean, Spencer Leigh, Charles Ellis and Richard Fillery with successive balls. (Spencer Leigh was the great-nephew of Jane Austen.)\nAlbert Trott and Joginder Rao are the only known bowlers credited with \"two\" hat-tricks in the same innings in first-class cricket (double hat-tricks notwithstanding). One of Trott's two hat-tricks, for Middlesex against Somerset at Lords in 1907, was a four in four (i.e. a double hat-trick). Similarly, there are at least two known instances of first-class hat-tricks from two innings in the same match. Amin Lakhani achieved this feat for the Combined XI side against India in Multan in 1979, while Starc's hat-tricks occurred in 2017 in a Sheffield Shield clash between New South Wales and Western Australia.\nFor Gloucestershire against Yorkshire in 1922, Charlie Parker had a hat-trick that was nearly five wickets in five balls: he actually struck the stumps with five successive deliveries, but the second was a no-ball.\nFive wickets in five balls was achieved by Scott Babot of Wainuiomata Cricket Club playing in the Senior 3 competition in New Zealand in 2008; it happened across two innings and separated by seven days, as the match took place on consecutive Saturdays.\nDuring Brazil's national T20 in 2017, the spectators witnessed a triple hat trick when Carioca Cricket Club's off spinner, Rafi ur Rahman claimed 5 wickets with 5 consecutive balls. The feat came against Brasilia Federal District when the unorthodox off spinner claimed a leg before, two players clean bowled and two caught. The moment was declared \"Best of the year\" in the 2017 national awards by the club.\nA 'perfect over' of 6 wickets taken with 6 consecutive balls was achieved by Australian Aled Carey on 21 January 2017 while bowling for Golden Point Cricket Club against East Ballarat Cricket Club in the Ballarat Cricket Association competition. This very rare feat consisted of 2 catches, an LBW and 3 bowled.\nThis feat was also achieved by Matt Rowe, aged 17, playing for Palmerston North Boys' High School 1st XI on 22 March 2023 in a match against Rotorua Boys' High School in Tauranga, New Zealand. Rowe's first delivery of the 'perfect over' netted a catch in the slips, followed by 4 clean-bowled and the 6th LBW. Rowe finished with bowling figures of 9 for 12 and PNBHS subsequently chased the total of 26 in 2.1 overs.\nTaking two wickets in two consecutive deliveries is occasionally known as a brace, or, more commonly, especially until the next delivery has been made, being on a hat-trick. In Australia, four wickets in four balls is sometimes referred to as a double hat-trick on the basis that there are two ways of compiling the three-in-three sequence (i.e. wickets 1,2 and 3 or wickets 2,3 and 4).\nThree dismissals by fielders.\nThere are very few cases of a fielder or wicket keeper taking a hat-trick of dismissals off consecutive deliveries in first-class cricket, and none in international cricket. The first such instance is the only known hat-trick of stumpings by a wicket-keeper: W. H. Brain for Gloucestershire against Somerset in 1893, all off the bowling of C. L. Townsend. There has never been a first-class wicket-keeping hat-trick that mixes catches and stumpings, but four other wicket-keepers have taken a hat-trick of catches: KR Meherhomji for Railways vs Freelooters at Secunderabad (the only instance outside England) in 1931, GO Dawkes for Derbyshire vs Worcestershire at Kidderminster in 1958, RC Russell for Gloucestershire against Surrey at The Oval in 1986, and T Frost for Warwickshire against Surrey at Edgbaston in 2003. (In Russell and Frost's cases, no bowler took a hat-trick, since their catches were taken off different bowlers in successive overs: Meherhomji's and Dawkes's feats were hat-tricks for the bowlers as well, L Ramji and HL Jackson.) There are only two recorded cases of a hat-trick of catches being recorded by a non-wicket-keeper, both of which were also hat-tricks for the bowler as well: GJ Thompson, for Northants against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 2014 (all off SG Smith), and Marcus Trescothick for Somerset against Notts in 2018 at Trent Bridge (all off Craig Overton). Trescothick – though more famous as a batsman and only an occasional bowler – has also taken a hat-trick as a bowler, in 1995 against the Young Australians."

        "text": "The Royal Colombo Golf Club is the oldest golf club in Sri Lanka. Established in 1880, it is located in the capital city of Colombo at \"The Ridgeway Links\" also known as the \"Anderson Golf Course\". It is home to the Sri Lanka Golf Union, the governing body of Golf in Sri Lanka and maintains links with The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland.\nHistory.\nOn 13 March 1880 ten founding members, led by Edward Aitken (founder of Aitken Spence), met at the Colombo Club and held the first General Meeting of the Colombo Golf Club. The first Chairman and Captain was W. Law and the Committee consisted of W. Somerville, F. A. Fairlie and R. Webster. The competitive trophy of the club dates back to 1887. In 1888 the Calcutta Golf Club presented a silver medal to the club; the Calcutta Medal is a permanent challenge medal still contested at the club.\nThe club was maintained at Galle Face Green until June 1896, when the club was told by the Colonial Secretary that the Governor of Ceylon would give the golf club a part of the Model Farm in Borella. The land and funds for the Model Farm were provided by Sir Charles Henry de Soysa. The golf course was opened in July 1896 by Governor Joseph West Ridgeway, after whom the Ridgeway Links were named. In 1928, King George V bestowed upon the club a royal charter, which enabled the club to use the prefix \"Royal\", and consequently the club came to be known as the Royal Colombo Golf Club. Originally membership was limited to British and European members, but in 1936 membership was extended to the Ceylonese.\nDuring World War II the clubhouse and the golf links were used by the Royal Navy code breakers of the Far East Combined Bureau and were known as \"HMS Anderson\"."

        "text": "The Northeastern women's ice hockey team represents Northeastern University. The Huskies play in the Hockey East conference.\nHistory.\nThe women's varsity hockey program started in 1980, and under Don MacLeod, who was named the coach the following season and led the program for ten seasons. Northeastern became the first national power in collegiate women's hockey under his direction. MacLeod was a former Massachusetts High School hockey coach at both Georgetown Junior-Senior High School and Saugus High School. Starting in the 1982–83 season, the lady Huskies had thirteen consecutive winning seasons, including six straight seasons of twenty or more wins between 1986–87 and 1991–92.\nThe program's best record was in 1987–88, when the undefeated squad finished 26–0–1, winning its first of three ECAC titles (the others coming in 1989 and 1997), at the time the effective national women's college championship. Northeastern has also been the ECAC finalist seven times, as well as winning eighteen women's Beanpot tournaments, including nine straight between 1984 and 1991–92. The Huskies' all-time best mark for wins was in 2022-23 with 34 so far.\nThe program's career scoring leader is Alina Müller, currently with 98 goals and 156 assists for 254 points, while Kendall Coyne is the career goals leader with 141. Coyne also holds the single season goal and points record with 50 goals and 84 points in the 2015-2016 season. The previous single-season goal and points leader was Vicky Sunohara, with 51 goals and 78 points in 1988-89.\nFrom 2017-2024, the Huskies played in eight consecutive Hockey East championships, winning six in a row from 2018-2023. Alina Müller (2019–2020, 2021-2022, 2022–2023) and Aerin Frankel (2017–2018, 2018-2019, 2020–2021) won the tournament MVP honors. The Huskies set a record for most goals in a women's Hockey East championship game with their 9-1 win over the University of Connecticut Huskies in 2020.\nRoster.\n&lt;section end=roster /&gt;\nSeason-by-season results.\nBeanpot.\nThe Northeastern women have historically found success in the Beanpot, winning 19 of 45 tournaments and compiling a 54-31-6 record through 2024. The Huskies appeared in 16 straight finals, from 1983 to 1998, winning 13 of those tournaments, including 9 straight. The Huskies have qualified for the Beanpot finals 30 times through 2024:\n2021: Cancelled due to the Coronavirus pandemic\nNotable alumni.\nAmong notable players for Northeastern have been former Canadian national team captain Vicky Sunohara, United States national team goaltender Kelly Dyer who was also the second woman to play professional ice hockey in North America, United States national team goaltender Chanda Gunn, ten-time United States national team member Shelley Looney, 2002 collegiate women's player of the year Brooke Whitney, and long time Canadian national team member and Olympic medalist Laura Schuler. Chelsey Goldberg is now a professional ice hockey player.\nThe following Huskies have played on the United States national team: Tina Cardinale (1990, 1992), Kendall Coyne (2010–12), Kim Haman (1992), Erika Silva (2004), Jeanine Sobek (1990, 1992, 1994–96), Brooke White (2001, 2004), Hillary Witt (2001). Florence Schelling was the goaltender of the Switzerland national team (2004–2018).\nHilary Witt\nWitt came to Northeastern University in 1996 from Canton High School in Canton, Massachusetts. In hockey she played on the Assabet Valley Club team for four years while they won two National Championships. In her freshman year, she helped the Huskies to a 27-9 season and the 1997 ECAC Championship. Witt scored two goals, including the game winner, in the 3–2 title win over New Hampshire and as a rookie was named the tournament MVP. She led the team in scoring that season with 24 goals.\nIn Witt's sophomore season she led the team in scoring once again with 32 goals, and her 58 points (ranked in the nation's top 10). She was a nominee for the Patty Kazmaier Award. She was also voted All-ECAC. The team went 26-6-5 and qualified for the ECAC Tournament and the semifinals of the first ever women's hockey National Championship.\nAs a junior, Witt led NU with 27 goals, and was in the nation's top 10 in scoring. Once again, she was a Kazmaier nominee. The team went 25-7-3 and went on to the ECAC Tournament. Witt captained Northeastern's 1999–2000 team to a 22-9-3 season and another post-season appearance. She led NU in scoring with 30 goals for the fourth consecutive year. In terms of scoring, was in the nation's top 10, and was voted All-ECAC. Also, for the third year in a row she was a Kazmaier candidate. On February 10, 2010, she was inducted into the Women's Beanpot Hall of Fame. The induction honors her performance as a player for Northeastern in the annual tournament featuring the four Boston-area women's hockey teams.

        "text": "The Texas Tech Red Raiders basketball program competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division I, representing Texas Tech University in the Big 12 Conference. The program has had 17 head coaches since it began play during the 1925–26 NCAA men's basketball season.\nTexas Tech (then known as Texas Technological College) basketball team was formerly named the \"Matadors\" from 1925 to 1936, to reflect the influence of the Spanish Renaissance architecture on campus. The Matadors' first head coach, Grady Higginbotham, started and led the program until Victor Payne replaced him after two seasons. In 1932, Texas Tech was admitted to the Border Intercollegiate Athletic Association, also known as the Border Conference. In the team's first season of conference play, Texas Tech's fourth head coach, Dell Morgan, went undefeated, winning the first of three consecutive Border Conference championships. At the beginning of the 1937–38 season, Texas Tech's short-lived Matadors moniker was replaced officially with \"Red Raiders\", the nickname the team has today. Texas Tech received their first postseason bid in 1942 to the National Association of Intercollegiate Basketball (NAIA) tournament during Berl Huffman's final season with the team in his first term as head coach. Huffman's successor, Polk Robison, led Texas Tech to their first NCAA tournament appearance in 1956, the same year Robison began a three-year conference championship winning streak. Before withdrawing from the Border Conference in 1956, the Red Raiders won five conference championships and one co-championship.\nIn 1957, Texas Tech was admitted to the Southwest Conference (SWC), in which it experienced similar success as it had in the Border Conference. In the regular season, the Red Raiders won four conference championships and three conference co-championships. At the end of the 1976 regular season, the SWC began an annual conference tournament known as the SWC Classic. Texas Tech won five SWC Classic titles in their six appearances in the conference tournament championship game; three under Gerald Myers and two under James Dickey. The university remained in the SWC until the conference ceased operations in 1996, when Dickey's 1995–96 team ended the season ranked eighth in both the Associated Press Poll and Coaches' Poll and won the conference's final regular season and SWC Classic titles. Following the dissolution of the SWC, the university became a charter member in the South Division of the Big 12 Conference. Since joining the Big 12 Conference, the Red Raiders did not receive a bid to postseason play until 2002, when Hall of Fame coach Bob Knight was hired. During Knight's six-year tenure, Texas Tech received five postseason bids, participating in four NCAA tournaments and one National Invitation Tournament (NIT). The Red Raiders won the third place playoff in the 2003 NIT tournament, the farthest a Red Raiders men's basketball team has advanced in postseason play. During the 2007–08 season, Bob Knight resigned as head coach and his son, then assistant head coach, Pat Knight became Texas Tech's 13th head coach. In the 2009-10 season, Pat Knight led the Red Raiders to the (NIT) where they were defeated in the quarterfinals. After failing to make the NCAA tournament, and compiling a 16-42 Big 12 Conference record over his three and a half seasons as head coach, Texas Tech terminated Pat Knight's position has head coach. On March 20, 2011, Texas Tech hired Billy Clyde Gillispie, former head coach of the Kentucky Wildcats, Texas A&amp;M Aggies, and UTEP Miners, as the 14th head coach of the Texas Tech men's basketball program."

The derby was held on July 11, 2011, at the site of the 2011 MLB All-Star Game, Chase Field in Phoenix, Arizona.\nRobinson Canó won the derby, setting a record for home runs in the final round with 12.\nRules.\nEach participant is thrown pitches by a pitcher of his choice. The hitter has the option of not swinging at a pitch. If he swings at a pitch and misses or hits the pitch anywhere but in home run territory, it is considered an out. Each player hits until he receives 10 outs in each round. When nine outs are reached in each round, a \"gold money ball\" comes into play.\nIn the first two rounds, home run totals will carry over for those rounds. Should there be a tie after either of the first two rounds, a \"Swing-Off\" takes place. In a Swing-Off, each tied player gets five swings to get as many home runs as possible. If after the 5 swings a tie still remains, players get one more swing to determine the winner. Home runs hit during a first round Swing-Off do not count towards the player's total going into the second round. All eight players participate in the first round; the four highest totals from round one will move to the semi-finals. The players with top two totals will face off in the finals, with the scores reset from the first two rounds.\nResults.\n\"italics\" – Hall of Famer\nCharitable initiatives.\nState Farm donates US $3,000 for each non-Money Ball home run for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, and US$18,000 (one dollar for each State Farm agent) for Gold Ball homers (which are home runs hit after 9 outs have been recorded) in the first round, increasing after each round. In addition, eight BGCA representatives for Arizona received a minimum of US$10,000, with the overall winner's representative receiving US$50,000 for their local clubs. The total amount raised was US$603,000."

        "text": "A list of the top 30 most attended IIHF World Championships (out of 85 total). The 2015 tournament, in Prague and Ostrava (Czech Republic), holds the record for overall attendance and the record for average spectators per game. Not included are the Olympic tournaments, which though they are run as an IIHF tournament, have been separate from the \"World Championships\" since 1972.\nDespite reluctance in some circles to have such a tournament in Olympic years, three of the five most attended World Championships overall have taken place on years that coincided with the holding of a best-on-best tournament, either the Olympics (2010 and 2014) or the World Cup of Hockey (2004).\nIt should be considered that because of a changing pool-size of teams through the years, the number of games contested at the IIHF World Championships can range from 32 in 1979 to 64 in 2012 and beyond, therefore \"attendance per game\" is an equally important statistic to measure the success of a given tournament. Ten tournaments have had averages over 9,000 spectators per game, and six have topped the 10,000 mark.\nIn an effort to broaden the sport's appeal, the number of top division teams was increased from a mere 8 (as late as 1991) to 16 (starting in 1998), leading to an influx of lesser teams that could negatively impact average attendance. To combat this, some organizers have aggressively pushed the sale of day passes that bundle popular games with less sought-after ones.\nFinland hosted seven of the top 30 most attended tournaments. There are two countries with five of the top 30 most attended tournaments: Russia (including two tournaments held in the Soviet Union) and Sweden. Czech Republic hosted four of the top 30 most attended tournaments (including two tournaments held in Czechoslovakia), Germany – three, Latvia and Slovakia – two each. There are 6 other countries who have hosted the championships at least once, and are represented on the top 30."

        "title": "Fencing tactics",
        "text": " Tactics are very important to playing well in modern fencing and although technique is important in the sport, using an array of tactics will help fencers make the most of that technique.\nBladework.\nSimple attack.\nOffensive bladework consists of the various means of scoring a touch on an opponent. The straight attack is a direct extension towards valid target. As it is easily defended against, fencers often use numerous feints to deceive their opponent into parrying and then disengage around the blade. As a preparation for an attack, fencers may execute a prise de fer, or attack on the blade. This includes the simple beat, a sharp rap on the opponent's blade, and the more complex bind, in which the fencer forces the opponent's blade to a different line.\nComposed of one move (a thrust, lunge or fleche), the \"simple attack\" is normally countered with a \"parry riposte,\" parrying (blocking or pushing aside) the opponent's blade and then attacking with this tactic. It can also be countered with a thrust in some situations. They are most effective when the distance between the fencers is small enough that the opponent cannot execute a parry riposte. Often fencers will try to close distance before mounting a simple attack to use this to their advantage. Sometimes, a fencer will make a simple attack and when the opponent parries, the fencer can then make a counter parry and riposte.\nCombined attack.\nThe \"combined attack\" (also known as the \"compound attack\") can be quite effective, despite its vulnerability to counter-attack. A fencer using the compound attack makes a feint, prompting the opponent to parry and makes an indirect attack in response.\nFeint.\nThis attack is where you point your blade at your opponent. Your opponent will try to parry it, but you will disengage and touch.\nParry.\nA fencer deflects or blocks the opponent's blade with their own to defend themselves. This is usually followed by a \"riposte\".\nThe nine classical parries comprise basic bladework. The first parry that most fencers learn is \"quarte\", known commonly as \"parry four\". Parries are named for the line that they defend from attack: parry four would defend line four, which is the high inside line.\nParry and Riposte.\nThe \"parry riposte\" uses the strength of one's own blade to avoid the opponent's. After performing it, the fencer then counters the attack with a combined attack which would force the opponent to parry, allow you to counter parry the opponent's blade, and allow you to penetrate their next parry to win.\nCounter-attack.\nAn offensive action executed into an opponent's attack. A fencer might choose to counterattack if they believe their opponent's attack will miss, or they might combine the counterattack with an evasive action (such as ducking beneath the opponent's attack) or simultaneously using their blade to deflect their opponent's attack during the counterattack (called a counterattack \"in opposition\").\nFootwork.\nIn a fencing bout, a great deal depends on being in the right place at the right time. Fencers are constantly manoeuvring in and out of each other's range, accelerating, decelerating, changing directions and so on. All this has to be done with minimum effort and maximum grace, which makes footwork arguably the most important aspect of a fencer's training regimen. In fact, in the first half of the 20th century it was common practice to put fencers through six months to a year of footwork before they were ever allowed to hold a sword. This practice has now been largely abandoned.\nModern fencing tends to be quite linear. This is due to the width of the \"piste\" — no more than 2 m — and rules dictating a halt once fencers come into contact, pass each other, or turn their backs.\nThese rules may reflect older dueling styles and the changing nature of weapons: Sideways movement, which was a common defense against an attack with a comparatively unwieldy weapon like the rapier, became an unreliable tactic when faced with smaller, much lighter weapons. In contemporary sport fencing defense by footwork usually takes the shape of moving either directly away from your opponent (out of his/her range) or directly towards him/her (making the attack \"overshoot\").\nThe fencing stance and movements may appear artificial, but they have evolved over centuries of trial and error to afford optimal protection and mobility. Fencers tend to stand somewhat side-on to the principal direction of movement (the \"fencing line\"), leading with the weapon side (right for a right-hander, left for a left-hander). In this \"fencing stance\" the feet are a shoulder-width or more apart with the leading foot forward and the trailing foot at right angles to it. Finally, the knees are well bent and the center of gravity is kept midway between the heels. The fencer is now in a position where he/she is well balanced, able to use his/her leg muscles to generate rapid bursts of speed and change directions with comparative ease. In foil and épée, particularly, this stance decreases the vulnerable target area. Further, and more importantly, it maintains balance and ease of movement both forward and backward.\nThe most common way of delivering an attack in fencing is the lunge, where the fencer reaches out with his/her front foot and straightens his/her back leg. This maneuver has the advantage of allowing the fencer to maintain balance while covering far more distance than in a single step, yet still allowing a return to the more defensive fencing stance.\nSometimes fencers do take the more \"natural\" kind of steps, where the back foot passes the front foot. These are usually referred to as \"cross-steps\". While cross-steps do have the advantage of range and speed, they may put a fencer in an awkward and frequently unbalanced position mid-step.\nA somewhat exaggerated version of the cross-step, sometimes used to deliver an attack in foil or épée, is the \"flèche\" (\"arrow\" in French). In the flèche, the fencer leans forward and takes a long running cross-step, generating most of the thrust with his/her front leg. Ideally, the hit delivered with a flèche should arrive as or just before the fencer's front foot hits the ground. When (as often happens) the flèching fencer runs past the defender the defender is allowed to finish a defensive action, generally a riposte following a parry.\nIn sabre forward cross-steps were prohibited in the 1990s, one of numerous efforts to increase the sport's popular appeal. This also removed distortions caused by the introduction of electronic scoring where sabre bouts degenerated to both parties charging to get the hit in first before passing their opponent and therefore ceasing to be a valid target.\nVariations and portions of the above movements can also be used by themselves. For example, a \"check-step\" forward is performed by moving the back foot as in a retreat, then performing an entire advance. This manoeuvre can trick your opponent into thinking that you are retreating, when in reality you are about to close distance.\nOther footwork actions include the \"appel\" (French for \"call\"), which is a stomp designed to upset the opponent's perception of rhythm, and the \"ballestra\", which is a \"hopping\" step occasionally used as a preparation for attacks (the back foot leaves the ground, while the front foot is still in mid-air; both feet come down at the same time).\nIn general, Olympic fencing has put a premium on balance, speed, and athleticism in footwork, somewhat diluting orthodoxies regarding the classical stances and methods. To a degree, this has led to increasing resemblance between fencing footwork and that of other martial arts, with the significant caveat that a scoring \"touch\" requires almost no power behind the blow, only timing and the ability to manipulate distance.\nTactical wheel.\nThe tactical wheel is a visual representation which can help people understand how and when many tactics should be used. It also illustrates how different fencing tactics can be countered. It is also important to think ahead about an opponent's strategy, for expert players, even as far as four moves ahead, while minding your vulnerability to attack."

        "title": "Wimbledon Pro",
        "text": "The Wimbledon World Lawn Tennis Professional Championships, also known as the Wimbledon Pro, was a men's tennis tournament held in August 1967. The tournament was sponsored and broadcast by the BBC to mark the invention of colour television. It was the first tournament staged at Wimbledon that was open to male professional tennis players since the British Professional Championships in 1930, and had a prize fund of US$45,000. The singles competition was an eight-man knockout event won by Rod Laver, who received £3,000, whilst the doubles was a four team knockout event won by Andrés Gimeno and Pancho Gonzales.\nHistory.\nDuring Wimbledon in 1966, Jack Kramer was doing radio commentary for the BBC when Wimbledon's working chairman Herman David came to the broadcast booth and talked to Kramer and BBC tennis exec Bryan Cowgill about the possibility of making the tournament \"open\" to both amateurs and pros. The topic had been raised on and off for years. In the summer of 1960, the International Lawn Tennis Federation (ILTF) had met in Paris and voted on open tennis, and the motion received 134 votes, 5 short of the 139 required to pass. By 1966, public interest in tennis had been low for some time. Cowgill suggested a trial pro tournament at Wimbledon for the following year.\nIn late August, 1967, the Wimbledon Pro tournament was held. Total prize money was US$35,000 for singles and US$10,000 for doubles, making it the largest prize-money event in tennis history at that time. All matches were played on Centre Court. The tournament was deemed very successful, with over 30,000 spectators attending the three days of play. There was an 8-player draw for singles and a 4-teams draw for doubles, all professionals.\nMost of the players had won honours at Wimbledon in their amateur days but had forfeited the right to play there on turning professional. The segregation of the two categories was soon to come to an end. In December 1967, the Annual Meeting of the British Lawn Tennis Association voted overwhelmingly to admit players of all categories for the 1968 Wimbledon Championships and other future tournaments in Britain. Faced with a fait accompli, the ILTF yielded and allowed each nation to determine its own legislation regarding amateur and professional players."

        "text": "Edward Aloysius Dillon (November 1, 1882 – January 30, 1935) was an American football player and coach as well as a judge. He was the quarterback of the Princeton Tigers football team for four years from 1905 to 1908 and was selected as a first-team All-American in 1906 and 1907. He served as a state court judge in New Jersey from 1922 until the time of his death in 1935.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nDillon was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts in 1882. He was the son of Edward Dillon, who was considered \"one of the best printers in New England,\" and Mary Ann Beasley. His father was born in England to Irish parents and his mother was born in Ireland. Dillon attended Phillips-Andover Academy before enrolling at Princeton University.\nPrinceton.\nAt Princeton, Dillon was the quarterback for the university's football teams from 1905 to 1908. He also played center field and second base for Princeton's baseball team, returned punts and kickoffs for the football team, and was the first Princeton quarterback to make use of the forward pass. Sports columnist Lawrence Perry later wrote that Dillon was \"as intrepid a ball carrier, as game a defensive back as ever wore orange and black stripes.\" Perry described Dillon as follows:\"Eddie Dillon was an Irish boy from Massachusetts, resilient as a Damascus blade, the temper of which he approximated physically and mentally. He had clear gray eyes, a lean square jaw and a will of his own. His pride was the pride of a boy sensitive to the last degree.\"\nIn 1906, Dillon was selected as a first-team All-American by Caspar Whitney and \"The New York Times\". In 1907, he was selected as a first-team All-American by Fielding H. Yost and a second-team All-American by Walter Camp and Casper Whitney. He was also selected as captain of Princeton's football team for the 1908 season. In the 1908 publication \"Spalding's How to Play Football\", Dillon's contributions to the Princeton football team were described as follows:\"Dillon of Princeton is one of the cleverest quarters that ever handled the ball. Not only does he drive his team well, but he uses his plays with judgment, and he himself is a wonder at catching kicks and running them back. He does not himself enter into the interference or the push as much as some other quarters, and Princeton's plan of play does not give him the kind of forward passing to do as mentioned above in the case of Jones. He acts as though he could perform these duties if they were given him, and I look to see him develop along this line this season.\"\nAs a senior in 1908, Dillon was the captain of Princeton's football team, but he missed almost the entire season on account of injuries. At the end of the 1908 season, Caspar Whitney wrote in selecting his All-American team that \"Dillon of Princeton would undoubtedly have had the call for quarter if he had been able to play, but his injury rendered him practically of no use to his team.\"\nLater years.\nIn 1910, Dillon was hired as the head football coach at the University of Missouri in Columbia, Missouri after assisting Sewanee to a title in 1909, but he was released from his contract in March 1910 \"on the plea that business complications in Philadelphia necessitated his removal there.\" Dillon played professional football for the Lyceum team in Pittsburgh. The Lyceum team was undefeated from 1910 to 1912.\nDuring World War I, Dillon served as a pilot with the rank of ensign in the U.S. Navy's Naval Aviation Corps. He served as a judge of New Jersey's first judicial district from 1922 until his death in 1935 at age 52. Dillon died on the handball courts of the Montclair Athletic Club in Montclair, New Jersey."

        "text": "Charles Glidden Osborne (February 9, 1884 – January 15, 1961) was an American football player and coach. \nOsborne was born in the Roxbury neighborhood of Boston in 1884. He attended the Charterhouse School in England and the Magdalen College, Oxford.\nAfter studying at Oxford, Osborne returned to the United States and enrolled at Harvard University. He played college football at the fullback position for Harvard Crimson in 1904 to 1905. In 1906, he was moved to the tackle position. He helped lead the 1906 Harvard Crimson football team to a 10–1, the sole loss being a close game against national champion Yale. At the end of the 1906 season, he was selected by Caspar Whitney, Charles Chadwick, and \"The New York Times\", as a first-team tackle on the 1906 All-America college football team. Walter Camp named him to his All-America second team. He was a player who reportedly \"enjoyed the game himself every minute he was playing\" and \"played football purely for the fun he got out of it.\" He also played for Harvard's cricket and association football teams and was a member of D.K.E., Hasting Pudding, Signet and Digamma clubs.\nAfter graduating in 1907, Osborne became an assistant coach to the Harvard football team. In the fall of 1907, he wrote a letter to the Harvard Crimson advocating the formation of an alumni football team that would play against Harvard's varsity team each fall. Under Osborne's proposal, the alumni players \"would be enabled to keep up their football for a few weeks every fall,\" and they would benefit the varsity team by allowing them regularly to play \"against the strongest possible kind of scrub team.\"\nOsborne died in 1961 in Hastings, England. He was buried in the Garden of Remembrance at the Hastings Cemetery and Crematorium."

This pseudo-macroeconomic concept states that if a team from the American Football Conference (AFC) wins, then it will be a bear market (or down market), but if a team from the National Football Conference (NFC) or a team that was in the NFL before the NFL/AFL merger wins, it will be a bull market (up market).\nAs of January 2022, the predictor had been right 41 out of 55 games, a 75% success rate. Without retrospective predictions, i.e. \"after\" its invention in 1978, it had been correct in 29 out of 43 games, a success rate of 67%."

        "text": "Robert W. Forbes (1886–1947) was an American football player and coach. He was a first-team All-American end for Yale University in 1906 and was the recipient of one of the most significant passes in the first season in which the forward pass was legalized. He later served as the head football coach at the United States Military Academy and the University of Oregon.\nBiography.\nForbes attended Wesleyan and later Yale University. He played football at the tackle position for Yale University in 1905 and at the end position in 1906. The 1906 season was the first in which the forward pass was legalized, and Forbes caught one of the first big catches of the 1906 season. In her book, \"The Real All Americans\", Sally Jenkins described Forbes' catch as one of the most significant in the first year of the passing game: \"The only other significant pass that season was thrown by Yale, which gained a first down that led to victory over Harvard, when Paul Veeder threw thirty yards to Bob Forbes.\" Forbes was also a second-team All-American in 1905 and a consensus All-American in 1906, receiving first-team honors from Walter Camp for Collier's Weekly, Caspar Whitney for \"Outing\" magazine, \"New York Wold\" by Bob Edgren, and \"New York Sun\".\nAfter graduating from Yale in 1907, Forbes was hired as the head coach of the football team at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. He was the first regular head coach hired for the Army football team. \"The Pittsburgh Press\" praised Forbes in his first year with Army: \"West Point's strength on defense was a tribute to Bob Forbes' knowledge of Yale football. He had his opponents sized up very well, indeed, and gave his old team-mates a severe tryout with his cadet charges.\"\nAfter one year of coaching at West Point, Forbes moved west and played with the Seattle Athletic Club against Spokane on New Year's Day 1908. In February 1908, he was hired by the University of Oregon, where he served as the head football coach in 1908 and 1909. It was reported that the salary paid by the University of Oregon to Forbes was the highest paid a football coach in the northwest up to that point."

        "title": "Cost of the Olympic Games",
        "text": "The Olympic Games are considered to be the world's foremost international sporting event with over 200 nations participating. It historically had the highest costs and expenses for the hosts, with the estimated cost of the 2016 Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro being at approximately US$11.1 billion.\nSports-related costs for the Summer Games since 1960 is on average $5.2 billion (USD) and for the Winter Games $393.1 million dollars. The highest recorded total cost was the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, costing approximately US$55 billion. The 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Games experienced the biggest loss recorded at approximately $2 billion (USD).\nCosts.\nThe current highest cost of hosting the Olympic Games was the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Summer Games, costing approximately US$11.1 billion. In order to meet the requirements set out by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) The Rio de Janeiro council had to invest heavily in building the necessary facilities/venues, and an entirely new subway line. The lack of a solid infrastructure to support these investments led to the council underestimating their costs by 25%.\nThe costs of hosting the Olympic Games can be classified into 2 categories; infrastructure and operational costs.\nInfrastructure.\nGeneral infrastructure.\nThe costs of general infrastructure consist of preparing the necessary infrastructure to accommodate the influx of tourists and athletes in the host city. The International Olympic Committee requires a minimum of 40,000 hotel rooms available for visiting spectators and an Olympic Village that is able to house 15,000 athletes, referees, and officials.\nInternal and external transportation facilities that can transport spectators into and out of the host city and from venue to venue are also required by the Committee. These requirements are often met through renovations to already-built facilities or construction of entirely new facilities. These facilities include train/subway lines, roads, and airports.\nSports infrastructure.\nThe host city is also required by the Olympic Committee to invest in sport-specific infrastructure that meets their requirements. Facilities must have specified minimum sizes and reach the specific seating and safety protocols which often require refurbishments or new construction, particularly less-used facilities such as natatoriums, velodromes and sliding tracks.\nHost city selection.\nThe winter games needs high mountains, especially for the alpine events. Traditionally there were requirements of fairly short distance between the host city and the alpine slopes, which often has made smaller cities to be chosen as winter host cities, such as Lake Placid, Lillehammer and Sochi. These smaller cities have mostly lacked the arenas and accommodation needed, and had less need for them afterwards. After the 2012 when no democratic country bid for the winter games due to the high cost, a larger distance was accepted, allowing existing slopes to be used together with a large host city with more existing infrastructure, for example Milan at a distance of 410 km by road to Cortina.\nOperating costs.\nOnce the necessary infrastructure is put in place, the Olympics require a large amount of spending on operating costs throughout the duration of the Games. Historically, the most significant operating costs for the hosts have been in event management, organization and preparation of the opening and closing ceremonies, and increasingly in recent years, security.\nTable.\nThe table below lists the costs of hosting the Olympic Games. Due to the multitude of reporting methods, the table contains both the operating costs and total final costs (which include various infrastructure upgrades and security costs), as well as both known and not estimated figures. Net loss or gain are measured against the operating budgets. Intangible costs (such as to the environment and society) and benefits (through tourism) are not included here."

The annual rugby union tournament was contested by England, France, Ireland, Italy, Scotland and Wales, and was won by England.\nIreland played their first Six Nations games at the Aviva Stadium, having played their first matches at the new stadium in November 2010.\nFor the first time in its history, the tournament opened with a Friday night fixture. For the first time in a decade, all of the teams had the same head coach as in the previous year's tournament.\nThis tournament was also notable for a major upset, with Italy beating 2010 champions France. Despite this upset, Italy still finished last, and was awarded the wooden spoon as a result. The champions were England, who won their first four matches, but were denied the Grand Slam and the Triple Crown by a defeat to Ireland.\nItaly's Andrea Masi was named the Six Nations Player of the Championship, becoming the first Italian player to win the award with 30% of the voting. The runners up were Fabio Semenzato in second, Seán O'Brien in third and Toby Flood in fourth.\nFinal results.\nEngland won the championship after winning four out of their five matches, losing against Ireland. Due to France defeating Wales in the final match of the tournament, England ended the tournament at the top of the table. Had England beaten Ireland it would have led to their first Grand Slam since 2003. Italy lost their final match against Scotland to claim the wooden spoon for the ninth time since entering the competition in 2000.\nMedia coverage.\nIn the United Kingdom, BBC channels televised the matches live. The matches were also televised by France 2 in France, RTÉ Two in Ireland, Sky Sport in Italy and ESPN in Australia and New Zealand.\nIn Wales, Welsh language channel S4C televised Wales matches live.\nIn the United States and the Caribbean, Premium Sports televised the matches live while BBC America also televised some matches in the United States."

        "text": "Brian Lara is a former cricketer and captain of the West Indies cricket team. He was a skilled batsman, and was known for his ability to bat for long and high-scoring innings. From his debut in international cricket in 1990 to his retirement in 2007, Lara scored 11,953 runs in Tests and 10,405 in One Day Internationals (ODI), accumulating a total of 53 centuries. His accomplishments with the bat saw him chosen as the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1994, as well as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1995.\n Lara scored a Test century for the first time in his fifth Test match in 1993 against Australia. His score of 277 in that match is the fourth-highest maiden century in Test history. The 375 he made against England in 1994 was the highest individual Test score for nine years, until Matthew Hayden surpassed it in 2003. Lara regained the world record in 2004 when he made an unbeaten 400, once again against England. It is also the only quadruple century in Test cricket. The unbeaten 153 he scored against Australia in 1999 was rated as the second-best Test innings of all time by the Wisden Cricketers' Almanack in 2001. He has scored more than 200 runs on nine occasions, the highest after Donald Bradman and Kumar Sangakkara Alongside Sir Donald Bradman, Virender Sehwag and Chris Gayle, he is one of four batsmen who have scored triple centuries on two occasions. Lara scored 34 centuries during his Test career, the highest number by a West Indian player. He is ranked sixth for the highest number of centuries in a career along with Mahela Jayawardene, Sunil Gavaskar and Younis Khan, behind Sachin Tendulkar, Jacques Kallis, Ricky Ponting, Kumar Sangakkara and Rahul Dravid.\nLara's first ODI century came more than two years after his debut match, when he scored 128 against Pakistan. His career best is 169 runs made against Sri Lanka in 1995. It is also the third highest individual score by a West Indian batsman. The 117 he made against Bangladesh in 1999 is the fifth fastest century in ODI cricket. It was made in 45 balls at a strike rate of 188.70, reaching the boundary on eighteen occasions and clearing it on four. During his career, he scored more than 150 runs on three occasions. By the time of his retirement, he had scored 19 centuries in ODI matches. This is the second highest number of centuries scored by a single batsman for the West Indies, a record that Chris Gayle surpassed."

The club initially played on a field by Rimini railway station and at the Stadio Romeo Neri.\nIn 1973, the club moved to a purpose-built stadium. Under the leadership of Rino Zangheri, the club reached its biggest years of notability, with players including Mike Romano, who left the club for Novara United in 2012. In 1979, the club changed its uniform from white and red (the same colours of Rimini FC 1912) to black and orange."

        "title": "2013 America's Cup",
        "text": "The 34th annual America's Cup was a series of yacht races held in San Francisco Bay in September 2013. The series was contested between the defender Oracle Team USA team representing the Golden Gate Yacht Club, and the challenger Emirates Team New Zealand representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron. The format was changed radically to a best of 17, and Oracle Team USA defended the America's Cup by a score of 9 to 8 after Team New Zealand had built an 8 to 1 lead. Team New Zealand won the right to challenge for the Cup by previously winning the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup. The 34th America's Cup's race schedule was the longest ever, in terms of number of days and number of races, and the first since the 25th America's Cup to feature both teams in a match point situation.\nBackground.\nThe Golden Gate Yacht Club defeated Société Nautique de Genève in the 2010 America's Cup to become the Defenders of the 2013 America's Cup. The first Challenger of Record for the 34th Cup was Club Nautico di Roma, and a joint press conference was held on May 6, 2010, to plan for the event. The planning process was to include a definition of new rules and an independent management team.\nProtocol.\nThe Protocol for the 34th America's Cup was published on September 13, 2010.\nBoats.\nTwo new classes of boat were announced. AC72 wing-sail catamarans are being used for the America's Cup races and the AC45 class, a scaled-down one-design version of the AC72, was used for the preliminary training and racing until boats built to the AC72 rules became available. The amended AC72 Class Rule version 1.1 was published on February 22, 2011.\nThe AC72 can reach speeds averaging about with peaks over ; that speed can be as much as 1.8 to slightly over twice the actual wind speed. The previous America's Cup Class (ACC) boats reached speeds of .\nAmerica's Cup World Series.\nIn order to increase global awareness and hence attract sponsors for the teams an America's Cup World Series was held over the 2011–12 and 2012–13 seasons. The winner of each annual series was declared the America's Cup World Series Champion for that season. There were three regattas in 2011, five in 2012, and two in 2013. Each regatta lasted for one week and had approximately six days of racing, including official practice. Each AC World Series regatta was a combination of match and fleet racing. AC45 one-design catamarans were used for each World Series regatta.\nCost reduction.\nOfficials adopted rules for the 2013 America's Cup to reduce costs and thereby attract more challengers:\nDespite these measures the cost of mounting a competitive challenge exceeds US$100 million.\nYouth America's Cup.\nIn addition to using the AC45 catamarans for the initial world series races they are used in the nationality-based 'Youth America's Cup' (YAC). The smaller scaled down AC45 version of the AC72 with similar characteristics to the AC72 enables younger competition sailors to master the techniques used to sail this style of catamaran before they progress to the AC72 boats. The YAC began in 2013, when both first and second places were taken by New Zealand entries.\nThe winning team included Peter Burling, Blair Tuke, Jono Spurdle, Sam Meech, Andy Maloney, Jason Saunders and Guy Endean.\nVenue.\nOn July 8, 2010, Oracle Team USA announced that San Francisco was \"the only city in the USA under consideration to host the 34th America's Cup” match. At the time, KGO-TV and \"Gazzetta dello Sport\", an Italian sports newspaper, reported that Rome-Fiumicino, Italy was challenging San Francisco to host the event. Oracle Team USA confirmed that San Diego, Newport and Long Beach were considered earlier as possible venues for this event.\nA key parameter in deciding the venue was reliability of the wind and weather patterns so that pre-published television schedules would be virtually guaranteed to show racing rather than suffering endless postponements which was a significant problem for TV audiences watching the 2010 America's Cup. In early December 2010, BMW Oracle Racing became concerned that a full and final agreement with San Francisco would not be completed in time to comply with the requirement to announce the location of the cup venue on December 31, 2010. As a result, negotiations were activated with Newport, Rhode Island, as a potential venue for the cup. However, on December 31 San Francisco was officially awarded the right to host the 2013 America's Cup.\nTeams.\nInitially fourteen yacht clubs submitted notices of entry within the deadline, but two were declined and ten withdrew. Club Nautico di Roma was originally named as the Challenger of Record, but after their team Mascalzone Latino withdrew the Challenger of Record became the Royal Swedish Yacht Club, sponsoring Artemis Racing. Other notable teams that withdrew included former Cup holder Alinghi and the Energy Team from Yacht Club de France.\nOn August 2, 2012, the America's Cup Event Authority announced that four challenging teams would compete for the right to challenge Oracle Team USA, the only team that represented the defending Golden Gate Yacht Club. These teams were Artemis Racing (the Challenger of Record) representing Kungliga Svenska Segelsällskapet, Emirates Team New Zealand representing the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron, Luna Rossa Challenge representing Circolo della Vela Sicilia and the White Tiger Challenge representing Sail Korea Yacht Club. Luna Rossa, a late entry, formed a partnership with Team New Zealand where they would share design and testing information. Following Sail Korea's withdrawal in March 2013, the number of challengers dropped to three.\nCourse.\nThe course for the 34th America's Cup was specially designed to take advantage of the San Francisco Bay, to bring the racing within easy viewing of the shore for the first time. The starting area was furthest away from the shore, close to the Golden Gate Bridge. The boats were only allowed to enter the starting box two minutes before the usage of the starting gun. The boat entering on port tack was allowed to enter ten seconds before the starboard tack boat. This was to reduce the danger of having two boats travelling at up to heading towards each other into the starting area.\nThe length of the course varies, but is around and generally takes about 25 minutes to complete. During the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup on the same course, some races were raced with an extra lap around the leeward and windward gates. This seven leg course is around , taking approximately 45 minutes to sail.\nThe racecourse was delineated by a boundary. Going outside of the boundary draws a penalty which was indicated by blue lights on board the boats. The green lights on board the boats flashed whenever the boat was within three boatlengths of the boundary, or a mark. Whichever boat entered the three boatlength circle around a mark, had mark rights and was allowed to round without worrying about the other boat. The exception was when there is an overlap between the two boats. If an overlap exists, room had to be made to ensure both boats round the mark safely. The maximum time for a race is 40 minutes after which the race would be stopped.\nIf a penalty was awarded against a boat, a moving penalty line was calculated and placed two boat lengths behind them, advancing on a direct heading to the mark or the wind (depending which leg). The penalised boat had to slow their Velocity Made Good such that their boat fell behind the penalty line. This was calculated in real time by computers, and indicated to the teams on the water via the lights and direct radio communication.\nAlcatraz Island was a unique part of the racecourse for this event. For the first week of the event, San Francisco Bay experienced flood tides during the America's Cup races. As water flowed into the bay, there was a cone close to the Island where the incoming tide was noticeably less than the rest of the racecourse. On the upwind leg, when boats had to sail against the flood tide, tactical use of this cone was crucial.\nResults.\nChallenger determination.\nThe challenger was determined in the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup challenger selection series. Emirates Team New Zealand won the Louis Vuitton Cup and therefore the right to challenge Oracle Team USA in the America's Cup.\nCheating penalty.\nAn international jury found Oracle Team USA guilty of cheating during the America's Cup World Series warmup event in 2012 when they placed bags of lead pellets in their 45-foot catamarans to add additional weight outside of allowed areas. Penalties imposed included expelling three team members, a $250,000 fine, and a one-point penalty for each of the first two races of the Match in which they would otherwise score a point. This last penalty meant that Oracle had to win 11 races to retain the trophy, while New Zealand only needed to win 9 races to lift the cup.\nCup matches.\nThe 34th America's Cup was held between challenger Team New Zealand and defender Oracle Team USA on a five-leg course on San Francisco Bay. One point was awarded for winning a race, and a total of nine points were needed to win the cup. Due to the two race penalty assessed on Oracle Team USA, they needed 11 wins to defend the cup.\n1 Oracle's victories in races 4 and 8 did not award points, due to the penalty imposed by the jury.\n2 Oracle used their postponement card after race 5, canceling the second race scheduled for September 10.\n3 With Team New Zealand leading during the third leg, the second race on September 14 was abandoned by the race committee due to the wind exceeding the allowed maximum.\n4 Both races on September 17, and the second races on both September 18 and September 19, were postponed due to the wind exceeding the allowed maximum beyond a reasonable start time.\n5 With Team New Zealand well ahead in light winds near the end of the fourth leg, the first race on September 20 was abandoned by the race committee due to the race exceeding the 40-minute time limit.\n6 Both races on September 21 were postponed by the race committee due to the wind direction not permitting a fair laying of the race course.\n7 Due to the late start of race 16, a second race was not sailed on September 23 due to the 2:40pm cutoff time for racing.\nDefender and challenger personnel.\nOracle Team USA\nEmirates Team New Zealand\nProgress of the regatta.\nDay 1: September 7.\nThe 34th America's Cup began in stark contrast to the one-sided races that dominated the 2013 Louis Vuitton Cup. Team New Zealand, skippered by Dean Barker, led at the first mark, and held the lead for the second leg, which was the first leg to be facing downwind. Oracle Team USA was 4 seconds behind Team New Zealand at the bottom mark, and during the upwind third leg the lead changed several times. Team New Zealand led at the top mark by 25 seconds, and kept the lead until the finish line, winning by 36 seconds.\nRace two began as the previous one ended, with Team New Zealand in front, despite the aggressive prestart by Oracle's skipper Jimmy Spithill. Team New Zealand led the whole race, and completed the victory by 52 seconds to lead 0–2 in the overall scoreline.\nDay 2: September 8.\nOracle Team USA had better luck in the initial stages of Race three, as Spithill luffed Team New Zealand at the reach mark to successfully draw a penalty. Oracle held the lead for the first downwind leg, and were 18 seconds to the good heading into the upwind third leg. The pivotal moment of the race occurred when Barker brought the New Zealand boat back on port tack within three boat lengths of the boundary. Oracle was forced to tack away due to the boundary rights, even though they were on starboard, which would have otherwise have had right of way. The 29 second lead at the top mark was held by Team New Zealand all the way to the finish. They ultimately crossed the finish line 28 seconds ahead of Oracle, making the scoreline 0–3 to Team New Zealand.\nRace four again started well for Oracle, leading around the reach mark by 6 seconds. Although Barker pushed hard for the whole race, Spithill was able to hold off Team New Zealand, resulting in a finish 8 seconds ahead of Barker. Due to the penalty imposed by the International Jury, Oracle did not score a point, leaving the New Zealand remaining 3 points ahead.\nDay 3: September 10.\nOracle's defeat in race five by one minute and five seconds was so emphatic that the Americans played their one and only Postponement Card to call off the scheduled second race. Team New Zealand had once again been behind from the start all the way to the bottom of the race course. Once heading back upwind however, the New Zealand boat was noticeably faster and gained the lead with ease. A top mark delta of 1:17 effectively ended the race, and gave Spithill plenty of time to consider his options. The score at the end of the day was 0–4, to Team New Zealand.\nDay 4: September 12.\nDay four opened with the news that Oracle had changed their tactician. John Kostecki, who had raced on San Francisco Bay for decades, was dropped, and Sir Ben Ainslie, the skipper of Oracle's backup boat was brought on in his place. Another change was the noticeably lighter winds compared to the earlier days of racing.\nRace six followed a familiar refrain, with Oracle ahead at the start and holding that lead to the bottom of the downwind leg. After rounding the mark 12 seconds behind, Team New Zealand once again took over sailing into the wind. The highest number of tacks seen thus far was unable to prevent Team New Zealand from gaining 55 seconds during the third leg, and the 44 second lead at the top mark was extended to 47 seconds at the finish.\nTeam New Zealand led from start to finish in Race 7. After a run of being behind at the start, Barker was strong in the windward position off the line and was able to beat Oracle Team USA by a substantial amount at the reach mark. Along with another substantial gain during the third leg, Oracle Team USA could not counter Team New Zealand's progress and finished a 1:06 behind. Team New Zealand closed the day in a dominant position of 0–6.\nDay 5: September 14.\nRace eight brought Team New Zealand to the brink of disaster. Leading from the start to midway up the third leg, Team New Zealand was tacking back to starboard to once again cover Oracle. However, a lack of hydraulic power at a crucial moment during the turn meant that the large wingsail did not move in time. The boat's starboard hull rose out of the water and Aotearoa, Team New Zealand's boat, came within a degree of capsizing. To add insult to injury, Barker was penalised for failing to give way to Oracle, who was on starboard tack at the time. The New Zealand boat followed Spithill to finish 52 seconds behind.\nOracle's victory completed the penalty imposed by the International Jury, allowing them to accrue points for any subsequent victories.\nTeam New Zealand were ahead during the third leg of the day's second race, but it was abandoned by the Race Committee due to the wind exceeding the allowable maximum ( minus the tide).\nDay 6: September 15.\nRace nine showed Oracle Team USA at their best. Spithill again won the start, and extended the lead at every mark including for the first time, a notable gain against the Kiwi boat on the upwind leg. Recording consecutive victories for the first time allowed Oracle to obtain a point, with the score at 1–6.\nTeam New Zealand won race ten by 16 seconds, in what was widely reported as one of the most exciting America's Cup races of all time. Barker looked to have been left behind by Spithill at the startline, but just managed to hold an overlap as the AC72s entered the three boat length circle at the reach mark. Team New Zealand took the 3 second lead, and increased it to 11 seconds at the second mark. Oracle again showed their new competitiveness during the upwind beat, and the lead changed three times. As the boats approached the top mark on split tacks, Barker slowed the boat, and then aimed down to pass under Oracle at speed. The top mark split was only 1 second as Oracle rounded in front of the shore, and Aotearoa rounded the other mark. With the race still too close to call during the downwind leg, Spithill made the call to dip behind Team New Zealand rather than jibe. The gap almost instantly became 100 metres. Barker was able to hold this lead to the finish to take the series to 1–7.\nIn the post race press conference Barker said “If you didn’t enjoy today’s racing you should probably watch another sport.”\nDay 7: September 17.\nHigh winds postponed racing on day seven. Both teams were keen to race, and headed out to the starting area. However the start time for the first race was pushed back several times due to the wind limit, and with the wind continuing to increase, at 1:31 pm the Race Committee made the postponement official.\nDay 8: September 18.\nTeam New Zealand led all the way to win race eleven by 15 seconds, to move to match point in the race for the Cup. During the pre-start, Barker maneuvered in front of Spithill and then delayed both boats from crossing the start line until well after the gun had gone. Oracle performed well on the upwind beat, but Team New Zealand covered well, and the boats rounded opposite marks 17 seconds apart. At the final mark, Barker kept Aotearoa between Oracle and the mark, and the rounding was well below the usual speed. Team New Zealand were able to accelerate away leaving Oracle almost stationary in the water on the sprint to the finish line, taking the score to 1–8.\nThe second race of the day suffered a 15-minute wind delay postponement. The postponement came at the same as the boats hit the start line. Barker had perfected a time on distance sprint to the line, to obtain a lead on the way to the reach mark. The boats made their way back to the starting area, but the wind and the strong outgoing tide combined to confirm the postponement of racing for the day.\nDay 9: September 19.\nBarker was aggressive in the pre-start phase of the first race of Day 9. It did not pay off, and Spithill was able to get into a position where Team New Zealand was forced to keep clear. From that lead off the start line, Oracle led the whole race to win race twelve by 31 seconds. During the upwind leg, Oracle's performance was excellent. They were able to sail on their foils at speeds approaching . Oracle gained their second point to take the score to 2–8.\nThe start time for the second race of the day was pushed back several times due to the wind exceeding the allowed limit. At one point the teams were able to enter the starting box, but the wind then exceeded the limit again. Racing was then postponed for the day, allowing Oracle to keep alert for another day.\nDay 10: September 20.\nDay ten brought the lightest winds seen in the 34th America's Cup. The start of the first race was pushed back by five minutes, due to the need to shift one of the marks on the start line. Oracle had the better start in the winds, and luffed Team New Zealand at the reach mark. The first downward leg was very different from the rest of the racing, as neither boat was able to sail on its foils. Aotearoa appeared to be the stronger boat in the light breeze, and rounded the leeward gate 1:42 ahead of the Americans. The New Zealand boat continued to extend their lead during the third leg and the main concern turned to whether they would be able to cross the finish line within the 40 minute race limit. Unfortunately for them, despite being ahead by more than 1,000 metres in winds of between near the end of the fourth leg, with 90% of the race complete, the time expired forcing the abandonment of the race.\nThe resail of race thirteen began at 2:33pm in of wind. Spithill attempted to hook Barker during the pre start to gain advantage, but Barker managed to prevent Oracle from gaining the overlap. Team New Zealand led over the line, and took a 3-second lead around the reach mark. The pivotal moment of the race came towards the end of the second leg. Team New Zealand were slightly ahead and tried to cross in front of Oracle who had the starboard tack advantage. Spithill had to evade the Kiwi boat, and gained a penalty for the infraction. With the boats still close heading into the leeward gate, Barker fluffed his lines, and Aotearoa ended up being forced to jibe twice in quick succession. Oracle sped away to begin the third leg leaving the Kiwis almost non-moving. That effectively caused the result the race, and Oracle confirmed their third point by 1:24 at the finish. The New Zealanders' largest defeat of the Cup to date brought the score to 3–8.\nDay 11: September 21.\nIt had rained earlier in the day, with wind from the south, about 90 degrees from the desirable direction, at the time day eleven racing was scheduled to be undertaken. The race committee pushed the start back several times, hoping that the wind would turn enough to allow racing. This did not happen by the start cut off time, and weather again forced postponement of the day's racing.\nDay 12: September 22.\nRacing on the 22nd of September brought the America's Cup into its third week, equalling the previous longest regatta in Cup history, the 31st America's Cup. A whale was also spotted in San Francisco Bay, bringing enough of a concern that it was tracked to ensure it would not affect racing.\nRace fourteen was another start-to-end win by Oracle. Starting in the leeward position, Spithill again luffed Barker hard substantially past the reach mark. This set up a strong lead for the first downwind beat. On the upwind leg Team New Zealand were able to close the lead, and at one point had to dip under the American boat. However, they could not utilise the advantage to enough effect, and Oracle led well around the top mark. Team New Zealand once again closed the lead about halfway down the fourth leg, but could not make the pass. Oracle won by 23 seconds, to bring the score to 4–8.\nTeam New Zealand led off the line for race fifteen, but the leeward position of the Oracle Team USA boat allowed them to round the reach mark first. A huge downwind leg from the American boat saw them round the leeward gate 1 minute ahead of Team New Zealand. Team New Zealand did not give up, and were able to cut Oracle's lead in half by the windward gate, but were unable to make up the rest of the gap. Oracle had their best day in the race yet, winning both races to bring the score to 5–8.\nDay 13: September 23.\nThe start of race sixteen was delayed for 30 minutes while the race committee waited for the wind to increase. Emirates Team New Zealand took the leeward position at the start line but Oracle Team USA was able to sail on their foils, and sailed over on top of the New Zealand boat to lead by five seconds at the reach mark. At the second mark, the New Zealand team were 13 seconds behind Oracle and after a tacking duel upwind to the third mark, Oracle was able to obtain the wind advantage for the downwind leg. Oracle sailed conservatively downwind gaining a 21-second lead for the fourth mark, which they extended to 33 seconds by finish line. The score was now 6–8. It was Oracle's 5th straight win.\nThe earlier delay meant no second race for the day, as it would have exceeded the cutoff time of 2:40pm.\nDay 14: September 24.\nRace seventeen saw two penalties at the start against Emirates Team New Zealand. During the prestart, Dean Barker made his move too early, allowing Spithill to hook Barker. Oracle then took full advantage of their windward-leeward right of way, forcing Barker to attempt to stay out of the way. Due to the extremely low boat speed at the time, Team New Zealand was unable to avoid the American boat, and there was contact between the two AC72s as a second penalty was awarded against the New Zealand boat. By the time the penalties had been completed, Oracle had accelerated away to find themselves ahead by 18 seconds at the reach mark. Oracle built on this to obtain a 29-second lead to leeward gate, although this was trimmed to 19 seconds at the end of the third leg. Oracle went on to win by 27 seconds and cut Team New Zealand's lead to 7–8.\n\"We're not going to stop--we're going to keep going all the way to the end\", said Spithill. \"We really want this. You can sense it on board\". Barker called this defeat \"an absolute shocker\" as he ended in \"a really dead spot\".\nIn race eighteen the New Zealand boat led at the start and up to the first mark. They set the speed record of the series, reaching 47.57 knots (24 m/s; 88 km/h; 55 mph) as they rounded the mark, to lead by 5 seconds. They kept the lead during the first downwind run, but Oracle took the lead at the first crossing on the upwind leg, after Team New Zealand made a poor tack. Team New Zealand had starboard tack advantage and the lead at the time, but did not properly cover Oracle. The American boat was sailing on their foils, and was able to sail past Team New Zealand without much difficulty. Oracle went on to lead by 57 seconds at the windward gate and kept the lead for the rest of race, winning by 54 seconds.\nThis result tied the series 8–8 and forced a winner-take-all race. Spithill called this win \"very impressive\" and said, \"It gives us a lot of confidence going into tomorrow\", saying that Wednesday will be \"the most exciting day in the history of our lives. We wouldn't want to be anywhere else\".\nDay 15: September 25.\nThe final day of the 34th America's Cup brought only the third winner-takes-all match in Cup history (previous such matches had occurred in 1920 and 1983). Barker and Spithill had also both moved into the top 5 all time America's Cup skippers during this regatta.\nTeam New Zealand had port entry advantage, and were able to convert this into the leeward position at the start line and a lead around the reach mark. Oracle had a moment where both bows dipped into the water, slowing them to open some separation between the two boats. The first downwind leg saw both boats foiling at around , at times well within of each other. Team New Zealand took the lead into the upwind third leg, but were unable to hold it.\nOracle once again showed their upwind foiling ability and were able to pass with ease. Team New Zealand and Barker refused to give up, but in the absence of any mistakes from Oracle, they confirmed their victory 9–8 by 44 seconds on the line to the cheers of the crowd.\nAt the press conference following the race, Barker said his team was \"[feeling] pretty smashed, they are feeling it pretty bad\", whilst Spithill said Team New Zealand were a \"tough team\".\nSafety issues concerning the AC72.\nThe power and speed of the catamarans used in the America's Cup has attracted criticism since the AC72 rule was announced. Oracle's first AC72 pitch-poled in October 2012 after only eight days of sailing. Though there were no injuries to the crew, the yacht was heavily damaged as the tide pulled it outside the bay into the Pacific Ocean. On May 9, 2013, Swedish team Artemis' first AC72 yacht flipped, resulting in the death of Olympic gold medalist Andrew James Simpson. Stephen Barclay, CEO of the America's Cup Event Authority, promised a full inquiry into the events leading to Simpson's death and appointed a review committee to investigate both the Oracle and Artemis accidents, and to make recommendations for increasing the safety of the sailors.\nBroadcasting.\nThe NBC Sports Group acquired the American television broadcast rights in 2012, making it the first time the race would be on network TV since 1992.\nThe first two races aired on NBC with subsequent races airing live on NBC Sports Network. The races were also broadcast live and available on demand on the official America's Cup YouTube channel.\nTo enhance television coverage, America's Cup officials developed LiveLine, a system that inserts graphics into live shots from helicopters similar to the first down line graphics system used on American football broadcasts. LiveLine would be used to show distance between boats, boat speed, course boundaries and marks, boat paths, wind speed and ocean current direction. Race yachts carried military grade GPS tracking and telemetry systems to enhance the accuracy of measurements.\nThe system, developed by Sportvision, Inc., the America's Cup Event Authority, and NBC Sports Network, won the George Wensel Outstanding Technical Achievement Award at the 33rd Sports Emmy Awards.\n35th America's Cup.\nOnly moments after the win by Oracle Team USA, Hamilton Island Yacht Club in Queensland, Australia issued a challenge for the 2017 America's Cup. The challenge was accepted by the Golden Gate Yacht Club, which remained defender. Australian billionaire Bob Oatley was said to be financially backing the Hamilton Island Yacht Club as the Challenger of Record.\nHIYC withdrew its challenge on 18 July 2014 and in November 2014 it was announced that Bermuda would host the 2017 America's Cup."

        "title": "Weight class (boxing)",
        "text": "In boxing, a weight class is a measurement weight range for boxers. The lower limit of a weight class is equal to the upper weight limit of the class below it. The top class, with no upper limit, is called heavyweight in professional boxing and super heavyweight in amateur boxing. A boxing match is usually scheduled for a fixed weight class, and each boxer's weight must not exceed the upper limit. Although professional boxers may fight above their weight class, an amateur boxer's weight must not fall below the lower limit. A nonstandard weight limit is called a catchweight.\nWeigh-in.\nA boxer who is over the weight limit may strip naked to make the weight if the excess is minimal; otherwise, in a professional bout, one can try again later, typically after losing weight in the interim through dehydration by vigorous exercise in a steam room. If the excess weight is too great, the effort expended trying to \"make weight\" will make the boxer unfit for the fight itself. In such cases the fight may be cancelled with the over-weight boxer sanctioned or the fight may proceed as a catchweight non-title fight.\nThe International Boxing Federation (IBF) has a unique weigh-in policy in title fights. In addition to making the weight at the official weigh-in the day before the fight, the boxers are required to submit to a weight check on the morning of the fight. During this later weigh-in, the fighter must weigh no more than above the weight limit for the fight. If a boxer skips the morning weigh-in, or fails to make weight at that time, the fight can still proceed, but the IBF title will not be at stake. In heavyweight title fights, the second weigh-in is still mandatory, but since there is no upper weight limit in that class, a boxer can only be sanctioned for failing to submit to the weigh-in.\nAn amateur boxer must make the weight at the initial weigh-in; there is no opportunity to try again later. Boxers who fail to make their projected weights are eliminated from their bouts. There is a \"general weigh-in\" before the start of the tournament and a \"daily weigh-in\" on the morning of each of a fighter's bouts. At the general weigh-in, the fighter must be between the weight class's upper and lower limits; at the daily weigh-in only the upper limit is enforced. A fighter outside the limit at the initial weigh-in may be allowed to fight in a different class if there is space in the tournament. At major events such as boxing at the Olympics, there is a limit of one boxer per country per weight class.\nCulture.\nA boxer may fight different bouts at different weight classes. The trend for professionals is to move up to a higher class as they age, with muscle mass and bone density increasing over time. Winning titles at multiple weight classes to become a \"multiple champion\" is considered a major achievement. In amateur boxing, bouts are much shorter and much more frequent, and boxers fight at their \"natural\" weight.\nOne boxer is said to be better \"pound for pound\" than another if he is considered superior with due regard for their difference in weight. Theoretical comparisons of the merits of boxers in different weight classes are a popular topic for boxing fans, with a similar speculative appeal to comparing sports figures from different eras; in both cases, the competitors would never face each other in reality.\nHistory.\nIn the early nineteenth century, there were no standard weight classes. In 1823, the \"Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue\" said the limit for a \"light weight\" was 12 stone (168 lb, 76.2 kg) while \"Sportsman's Slang\" the same year gave 11 stone (154 lb, 69.9 kg) as the limit.\nSize mismatches were dangerous for the smaller boxer and unsatisfying for the spectators. National and world titles could only become recognised if standard weight classes were agreed upon. Important sets of weight classes were those specified in 1909 by the National Sporting Club of London, and those contained in the 1920 Walker Law which established the New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC).\nAfter the split in the 1960s between the World Boxing Association (WBA) and the World Boxing Council (WBC), the divisions were narrowed, creating more champions simultaneously, and making it easier for fighters to move between different weight divisions. Among the professional bodies, the names of the new divisions are not standardized between different sanctioning bodies, although the cutoff weights are. These weights are specified in pounds, reflecting the historic dominance of Britain (and, later, the United States) in the sport.\nGlamour divisions.\nBoxing has its own \"Original Eight\" weight divisions, also known as the \"traditional\", \"classic\", or \"glamour\" divisions. These divisions are the most prominent and widely recognized weight divisions in boxing. Manny Pacquiao has won world championships in the greatest number of the glamour divisions, winning championships in the flyweight, featherweight, lightweight, and welterweight divisions.\nTweener divisions.\nThe newcomer weight divisions or \"tweener divisions\", mostly recognized with either a \"super\", \"light\", or \"junior\" in front of their names, took many years to be fully recognized as legitimate weight divisions in boxing. Manny Pacquiao has won world championships in four of these divisions; super bantamweight, super featherweight, light welterweight, and light middleweight.\nCatchweights.\nA nonstandard weight limit is called a \"catchweight\". A catchweight may be agreed to for an individual bout—sometimes even for a championship bout—but championships are awarded only at the standard weight classes. For example, when Manny Pacquiao fought Antonio Margarito at a catch-weight of , the World Boxing Council sanctioned this as a title fight for jr. middleweight, whose limit is .\nProfessional boxing.\nThis table gives names and limits recognised by the four widely regarded sanctioning bodies (World Boxing Association (WBA), World Boxing Council (WBC), International Boxing Federation (IBF), and World Boxing Organization (WBO)); the label used in Boxrec.com's data; and by the magazines \"The Ring\" and \"Boxing News\".\nBridgerweight has been recognised by the WBC since November 2020, and WBA since December 2023 under the \"super cruiserweight\" label, but is not currently recognized by any other bodies.\nThe date is that since which a continuous world title has been recognised by a major sanctioning body; some classes had earlier champions recognised intermittently or by minor bodies. One current weight class with only minor recognition is \"super cruiserweight\"; widely used as an informal descriptor, it is a formal weight class of the lightly regarded International Boxing Association at a limit of 210 lb; the IBA's cruiserweight limit is 190 lb.\nAmateur boxing.\nWhen the (amateur) International Boxing Association (AIBA) was founded in 1946 to govern amateur boxing, it metricated the weight class limits by rounding them to the nearest kilogram. Subsequent alterations as outlined in the boxing at the Summer Olympics article; these have introduced further discrepancies between amateur and professional class limits and names. The lower weight classes are to be adjusted in September 2010, to establish an absolute minimum weight for adult boxers.\nAmateur weight classes also specify the \"minimum\" weight (which the same as the maximum weight of the next highest class). For safety reasons, fighters cannot fight at a higher weight. This also meant that even the heaviest weight class has a limit, albeit a lower bound. The lower limit for \"heavyweight\" was established in 1948 at 81 kg. When a new limit of 91+ kg was established in 1984, the name \"heavyweight\" was kept by the 81+ kg class, and the 91+ kg class was named \"super heavyweight\", a name not currently used in professional boxing.\nClasses are as follows:\nAt the Olympics, each weight class is a separate single-elimination tournament awarding one gold, one silver and two bronze medals in each weight class. The event format is geared so that the finals of all represented weight classes are held over the last two days of the competition, entrants that fail to win on the penultimate day being the Bronze medal recipients with the finals deciding Gold and Silver on the final day, all of the bouts are scheduled in ascending order of weight with the super heavyweight final last of all.\nEach weight class conducts preliminary and qualification bouts, for all represented classes where the number of entrants requires multiple match-ups before the finals, with the match-ups of the lightest weight class requiring such fighting first and continuing with each subsequent higher weight class as required, further, second, third and fourth round match-ups may be required to complete the schedule using the same weight class progression to ultimately reach the final"

        "title": "2003 Roger Federer tennis season",
        "text": "Roger Federer won his first Major title at Wimbledon, when he defeated Mark Philippoussis in the final, 7–6(7–5), 6–2, 7–6(7–3). Federer won his first and only doubles Masters Series 1000 Event in Miami with Max Mirnyi, and made it to one singles Masters Series 1000 final in Rome on clay, which he lost. Federer made it to nine finals on the ATP Tour, of which he won seven, including the 500 series events at Dubai and Vienna. Lastly, Federer won the Year-End Championships over Andre Agassi.\nYear summary.\nEarly hard court season.\nFederer began the 2003 season as the world number 6, with the stated goal of capturing his first career Grand Slam title. However, early loses in Doha to Jan-Michael Gambill and as defending champion in Sydney to Franco Squillari kicked off the year in an ominous fashion.\nIn the first Grand Slam tournament of the year, Federer entered as the sixth seed and had a good chance to win his first Grand Slam when his draw opened up with the quick elimination of major rivals Marat Safin and Lleyton Hewitt. Federer entered the round of 16 without having dropped a set and faced his early nemesis David Nalbandian of Argentina. The match was a back-and-forth struggle, however, Federer ended up losing the five set match 4–6, 6–3, 1–6, 6–1, 3–6.\nHe then won two hard-court tournaments in Marseille and Dubai, defeating Jonas Björkman and Jiří Novák respectively. These two tournament victories constituted his fifth and sixth career singles titles. Back in the United States Federer had disappointing results at the Masters Series tournaments in Indian Wells and Key Biscayne. He was upset in early-round matches by a pair of former French Open champions, Gustavo Kuerten and Albert Costa.\nClay court season.\nOn clay, Federer won the tournament in Munich defeating Finn Jarkko Nieminen 6–1, 6–4. This was his seventh career title and second career clay court title. Following this victory, Federer began his preparation for the French Open by competing in the clay masters tournaments in Rome and Hamburg. He reached the finals of Rome dropping only a single set, but was upset in a shocking defeat to the unseeded Spaniard Félix Mantilla 5–7, 2–6, 6–7(8). In Hamburg, the final tuneup before the French Open, Federer was defeated in the third round by Australian Mark Philippoussis 3–6, 6–2, 3–6.\nHis victory in Munich and finals showing in Rome launched Federer into the conversation as a favorite to win the French. Federer, seeded number five, was determined to prove himself at the French Open in 2003 after losing in the first round the year before. His opponent in the first round was Luis Horna of Peru who ranked number 88 in the world. Federer started out well, jumping out to a 5–3 lead in the first set before imploding and losing the match 6–7(6), 2–6, 6–7(3). After the nightmarish match where Federer committed an astounding 82 unforced errors he stated, \"I don't know how long I'll need to get over this defeat. A day, a week, a year—or my entire career.\"\nGrass court season.\nTwo weeks after his crushing defeat in the first round of the French Open, Federer began the grass court season. He competed in the Gerry Weber Open in Halle, Germany. Federer quickly wiped away the bitter defeat in France by reaching the finals and defeating German Nicolas Kiefer 6–1, 6–3. This was Federer's first title on grass and it propelled him to odds of 5:1 to win Wimbledon at the British betting offices—behind only Americans Andre Agassi and Andy Roddick. \nFederer entered Wimbledon as the fourth seed and quickly raced through the first three rounds. In the fourth round he faced Feliciano López and was victorious in straight sets even though he had to take numerous injury timeouts for a serious lower back injury sustained in the match warm-up. In the quarterfinals Federer was fortunate that the match was delayed because of rain and was able to rest his injury for two whole days. When the quarterfinals finally began Federer defeated the eighth seed Sjeng Schalken of the Netherlands. His next match was a blockbuster semifinal where he faced American favorite Andy Roddick. Roddick had won the other grass court tuneup at the Queen's Club Championships and was an extremely dangerous opponent on grass. Federer defeated his young American rival 7–6(6), 6–3, 6–3 and became the first Swiss man to advance to the finals of a Grand Slam tournament. In the finals Federer faced Australian Philippoussis who had defeated him earlier in the year at Hamburg. Federer, however, proved that he possessed the quality of a champion and rose to the occasion. As Philippoussis' backhand sailed into the net on championship point Federer sank to his knees, raised his arms above his head, and looked to the sky. He had defeated the Australian 7–6(5), 6–2, 7–6(3) and finally achieved his elusive first Grand Slam title.\nHis breakthrough and victory and the 2003 Wimbledon Championships proved especially significant because Federer would go on to win more Grand Slam and Wimbledon titles than any man in tennis history. This achievement of winning his first ever Wimbledon and Grand Slam title has been repeatedly described by the Swiss star as the highlight of his career along with his 2009 victory at Roland Garros.\nGstaad.\nImmediately following his historic Wimbledon victory, Federer flew to the Bernese Alps to honor his commitment of playing the Swiss Open in Gstaad. This tournament was unique in Federer's calendar as it was played on a clay surface in between the grass and summer hard court seasons. Federer's Wimbledon victory was honored by the tournament which gave the Swiss star a 1,760 pound milking cow named Juliette. Federer continued his winning ways until exhaustion finally caught up to him in the finals, where he fell to Jiří Novák in five sets ending his 15 match winning streak. This loss, however, could not lessen the euphoric atmosphere in Switzerland in the wake of his Wimbledon performance.\nSummer hard court season.\nDuring the North American summer hard-court season, however, Federer lost his initial opportunities to ascend to the top of the world rankings. Federer lost an extremely close match in the semifinals of the Masters Series tournament in Montreal to Roddick which ended in a final-set tiebreaker 4–6, 6–3, 6–7(3). This would be the last time he would lose to Roddick until 2008. At the Cincinnati Masters Federer lost to rival David Nalbandian in the second round. This loss to Nalbandian was extremely close as well with Federer on the unlucky end of a 6–7(4), 6–7(5) result.\nFederer entered the 2003 US Open for the first time ever as a Grand Slam champion. The number two seed breezed through the first three rounds of the tournament dropping only his opening set. In the fourth round Federer again faced nemesis Nalbandian who had defeated him in the previous tournament and held a 4–0 head-to-head record against the Swiss. The Argentine again frustrated Federer as the Swiss lost 6–3, 6–7, 4–6, 3–6. His goal of achieving the number one ranking receded even further as Roddick completed the American summer hard court triple.\nFall indoor season.\nDuring the autumn, Federer played four consecutive indoor tournaments in Europe. He won the tournament in Vienna defeating former world number one and French Open champion Carlos Moyá 6–3, 6–3, 6–3. However, he failed to reach the finals in his home tournament of Basel and the Masters Series tournaments in Madrid and Paris.\nTo end the year, Federer won his first Tennis Masters Cup title in Houston. As the third-seeded player, he defeated Andre Agassi to open the round robin in a thrilling 6–7(2), 6–3, 7–6(7) epic. He would go on to win in straight sets against Nalbandian, 6–3, 6–0, defeating the Argentine for the first time in his career. His last round robin match was against world number 2 Juan Carlos Ferrero who fell to Federer 6–3, 6–1. In the semifinals he defeated world number 1 and US Open champion Andy Roddick 7–6, 6–2. Federer entered the final against the 1990 champion Andre Agassi and won decisively 6–3, 6–0, 6–4.\nFederer challenged for the top ranking during 2003, finishing the year at world number 2, just behind Roddick and just ahead of Juan Carlos Ferrero."

        "text": "During the Parade of Nations at the 2010 Winter Olympics opening ceremony, held beginning at 6:00 PM PST on February 12, 2010, 82 athletes bearing the flags of their respective nations led their national delegations as they paraded into BC Place Stadium in the host city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.\nAthletes entered the stadium in an order dictated by tradition. As the originator of the Olympics, Greece entered first. Canadian delegates entered last, representing the host nation. The names of the nations were announced first in French and followed by English, the official languages of the Olympics, which also happened to be the official languages of the host nation. The nations entered in alphabetic order of their country names in English because it is the more dominant of the two languages in Vancouver and in the province of British Columbia.\nDelegations from North Korea and South Korea marched in separate delegations, unlike in the 2006 Winter Olympics when they marched together.\nOf the flag-bearers who led their respective delegations, all but one were athletes, the exception being Fuad Guliyev, a skating official from Azerbaijan. The sport which was most represented among the flag-bearers was alpine skiing, as alpine skiers led 26 delegations. Only one delegation was led by a short track speed skater, Hong Kong, led by Han Yue Shueng. Marjan Kalhor, an alpine skier and the flag-bearer for Iran, was both the first female flag bearer from her country and the first female athlete from her country to participate in the Winter Olympics. It was erroneously pointed out by a Canadian TV commentator that Tomomi Okazaki was the first female flag bearer for Japan. This title goes to Seiko Hashimoto in Calgary 1988. Other prominent flag bearers included Canadian speed skater and five-time Olympian Clara Hughes, American luger Mark Grimmette, who had helped carry the American flag during the 2002 Winter Olympics, and Czech hockey player Jaromír Jágr. Hughes is the only Olympian ever to win multiple medals at both the Summer and Winter Olympics.\nIason Abramashvili, flag bearer for Georgia, along with the other members of his delegation, wore black armbands during the march and received a standing ovation in memory of Nodar Kumaritashvili, a Georgian luger who was killed in an accident during a training run earlier in the day."

Harvard competes as a member of the ECAC Conference and plays its home games at the Bright Hockey Center in Boston, Massachusetts.\nHistory.\nThe Harvard Crimson \"iced\" its first regular season women's hockey team in the 1978–79 season. Their first game was a 17–0 defeat at the hands of the Providence Friars women's ice hockey program. The next game was a 2–1 loss to the Yale Bulldogs women's ice hockey program.\nIn 1998–99, the Crimson finished with a record of 33–1. Of the 31 wins, the Crimson won 30 consecutive games to close the season. In the previous season, the Crimson went 14–16–0. The final game of that 30 game streak was a 6–5 overtime victory over the New Hampshire Wildcats women's ice hockey program in the American Women's College Hockey Alliance (AWCHA) national championship game. During the season, the Crimson would win the Beanpot and Ivy League title. In addition, the Crimson won their first ECAC regular-season and tournament championships. This would be Katey Stone's first AWCHA national championship.\nIn 2001, Harvard participated in the inaugural NCAA Championship tournament. On January 18, 2003, Harvard beat the Boston College Eagles women's ice hockey program by a 17–2 mark, the largest margin of victory in NCAA history. Jennifer Botterill set an NCAA record (since tied) for most points in one game with 10. This was accomplished on January 28, 2003 versus Boston College. A few months later, Nicole Corriero tied Botterill's record for most points in one NCAA game with ten. She accomplished the feat on November 7, 2003 versus the Union Dutchwomen. In addition, she holds the NCAA record for most game winning goals in a career with 27. During the 2003–04 season, Nicole Corriero would set an NCAA record with 59 goals scored in a season. On February 26, 2010, head coach Katey Stone became the women’s college hockey all-time wins leader, surpassing former University of Minnesota head coach Laura Halldorson.

        "text": "The Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball team represents Saint Mary's College in Moraga, California, competing in the West Coast Conference of the NCAA. The team plays home games in the University Credit Union Pavilion, capacity 3,500; it is one of the smaller gyms in the WCC. The current head coach is Randy Bennett, who is the school's all-time wins leader. The Gaels have appeared in thirteen NCAA Tournaments—1959, 1989, 1997, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2017, 2019, 2022, 2023, and 2024.\nOn March 1, 2013, they were placed on probation by the NCAA for four years due to rules violations.\nTheir two historic rivals are the San Francisco Dons and the Santa Clara Broncos, two other Catholic schools in the San Francisco Bay Area that are in the WCC. More recently, the Saint Mary's Gaels have developed a rivalry with the Gonzaga University Bulldogs of Spokane, Washington.\nHistory.\nRecent success.\nUnder coach Randy Bennett, the men's basketball team has become recognized nationally as one of the top non-Power 5 programs in the United States. He inherited a 2–27 team when he arrived in 2001, and began recruiting an Australian named Adam Caporn. Since then, Bennett has built a reputation of recruiting Australian players; the Gaels have had at least one Australian player in every season since Bennett's arrival. With Caporn in the line-up, and his best friend and fellow Australian Daniel Kickert joining him the following year, Saint Mary's record improved to 9–20 in 2001–02, 15–15 in 2002–03, and 19–12 in 2003–04. In 2004–05, the team earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, although they lost in the first round. Their 15–1 record in McKeon Pavilion was its best ever.\nAfter rebuilding seasons in 2005–06 and 2006–07, the team enjoyed one of their best seasons in school history in 2007–08, behind the play of Australian freshman Patty Mills. The team was ranked in the AP and USA Today top 25 lists for five and six weeks, respectively. They ended up receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament in 2008 as well, but again lost in the first round. In 2008, the team got off to a strong start, going 14–2 before Mills broke his hand and missed a month. Mills came back in time for the West Coast Conference tournament, but after a loss to Gonzaga in the WCC tournament finals, the team was not selected for the NCAA tournament and played in the NIT. After the end of the year, Mills declared for the NBA draft and was a second-round selection.\nIn March 2010, the Gaels received an automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA tournament, after winning the championship game of the WCC Tournament. Having beaten Gonzaga in the tournament final, it was the Gaels' second WCC tournament victory since it began in 1987. In 2010, they won their first NCAA Tournament game since 1959, defeating the Richmond Spiders. On March 20, 2010, the Gaels, led by Omar Samhan, defeated second seeded Villanova to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, for their first time in the 64 team era. They then lost to 3 seed Baylor 72–49 to end their season 28–6 and with its worst loss of the year.\nFollowing the loss of Samhan to graduation, many expected the Gaels next season to be a rebuilding year. Led by point guard Mickey McConnell, however, Saint Mary's compiled a 25–9 record, 11–3 in the WCC, including the Gaels' first win against Gonzaga in Spokane since 1995. But after absorbing a late-season loss to last-place San Diego and dropping an ESPN BracketBuster game at home against Utah State, Saint Mary's failed to make the NCAA tournament. They would be upset in the first round of the NIT by Kent State. After McConnell graduated, Australian point guard Matthew Dellavedova became the team's new star alongside San Diego transfer and San Francisco native Rob Jones. The Gaels compiled a 27–6 record and went 14–2 in the WCC in 2011–12, including a win in Moraga over Gonzaga and a sweep of new conference member BYU. Saint Mary's spent most of the season ranked in the AP and Coaches' polls and won the outright WCC regular season title, the first time since 2000 that Gonzaga had not claimed part of the title. The Gaels then defeated Gonzaga in overtime in the WCC tournament, marking the first time in school history Saint Mary's won both the regular season and tournament titles. Saint Mary's lost to Purdue in the first round of the NCAA tournament.\nSaint Mary's Australian pipeline, historically focused on the Australian Institute of Sport (from where Caporn and Mills were recruited), continues to the present. The 2011–12 team featured four AIS graduates, including 2012 WCC Player of the Year Dellavedova, and another Australian, Jorden Page. The 2015–16 team had four AIS graduates, boasting a total of six Australians, and the 2016–17 roster had a program record of seven Australians. In the latter season, the Gaels went so far as to hold an official celebration of Australia Day for their home game against San Francisco, which fell on the holiday's date of January 26. Before the game, Australia's national anthem was played alongside the US anthem, and the school honored officials from Australia's San Francisco consulate.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Gaels have made 13 NCAA tournament appearances. They have an overall 7–13 record in tournament games.\nNIT results.\nThe Gaels have appeared in six National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 7–7.\nVenues.\nSaint Mary's basketball and volleyball teams play their home games at the University Credit Union Pavilion, which has a capacity of 3,500. It was originally named after George R. McKeon, a former member of the college's Board of Regents. Constructed in 1978, it underwent renovations in the summer of 2006, with new features including painted bleachers, new chair backseats behind the reserved section, a remodeled VIP section, and a banner with \"GaelForce\" on it behind the student section. In 2019, the venue was renamed to University Credit Union Pavilion."
