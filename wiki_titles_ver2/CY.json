        "text": "The 2000 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 2000. It was the 86th Rose Bowl game and was played on January 1, 2000 at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. The game featured the Wisconsin Badgers defeating the Stanford Cardinal by a score of 17–9. Ron Dayne, the Wisconsin running back, was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game for the second consecutive year.\nPre-game activities.\nOn October 26, 1999, the Pasadena Tournament of Roses selected Sophia Bush, a senior at Westridge School and a resident of Pasadena, to become the 82nd Rose Queen to reign over the 111th Rose Parade and the 86th Rose Bowl Game on the first New Year's Day of the 21st century.\nThe game was presided over by the 2000 Tournament of Roses Royal Court and Rose Parade Grand Marshal Roy L. Disney. Members of the royal court were: Princesses Lauren Beattie, La Canada Flintridge, La Canada High School; Caitlin Bogert, Pasadena, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy; Grace Chen, San Marino, San Marino High School; Kellie Handy, South Pasadena, South Pasadena High School; Carol Huang, San Marino, San Marino High School; and Mariasol Pena, Arcadia, Arcadia High School. The 1999–2000 Tournament of Roses President was Kenneth H. Burrows.\nTeams.\nWisconsin Badgers.\nWisconsin entered the game as the sole champions of the Big Ten Conference, their first untied conference championship season since 1962 when they played in the 1963 Rose Bowl, although they had been conference co-champions in 1993 and 1998, appearing in the 1994 and 1999 Rose Bowls. The Wisconsin offense featured a powerful running game with 1999 Heisman Trophy winner Ron Dayne at running back.\nStanford Cardinal.\nStanford entered the game as the champions of the Pacific-10 Conference. It was their first conference championship season since 1971 and their first Rose Bowl since 1972.\nAftermath.\nRon Dayne was named the Rose Bowl MVP for the second time (the first time being the 1999 Rose Bowl), becoming only the third player in the history of the Rose Bowl to repeat as MVP. To this day, he is the only player from a Big Ten Conference team to accomplish this feat: Bob Schloredt of the Washington Huskies (AAWU) was the first, Charles White of USC (Pac-10) was the second, and Vince Young of the Texas Longhorns (Big 12) has subsequently become the fourth.\nThe two teams would go on to face off again exactly thirteen years later in the 2013 Rose Bowl, with Barry Alvarez returning to serve as interim head coach for Wisconsin, but this time, Stanford would win 20–14.\n2000 Rose Queen Sophia Bush went on to become a successful actress, starring for nine seasons as Brooke Davis on \"One Tree Hill\", and later as Detective Erin Lindsay on \"Chicago P.D.\"."

It was the 87th Rose Bowl Game, and matched the champions of the Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences.\nThe University of Washington Huskies defeated the Purdue University Boilermakers Washington senior quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo was named the Player of \nTeams.\nWashington Huskies.\nIn the 2000 season, the Huskies shared the Pacific-10 Conference title with Oregon and Oregon State. Washington had given Oregon State their only defeat of the year 33-30. Oregon gave Washington their only defeat of the year 23-16. Oregon State beat Oregon in the 2000 Civil War game 23-13. Ultimately, it was a 23-37 loss at Wisconsin by Oregon earlier in the season that decided the Rose Bowl representative. With two losses, by the multiple team tie rules Oregon was out of the running. This left Oregon State and Washington, and the Huskies won the head-to-head matchup with the Beavers. Washington, Oregon State, and Oregon were ranked fourth, fifth, and ninth, respectively, in the final regular season AP football poll.\nIt was the fourteenth Rose Bowl appearance for Washington, but their first since going to three straight in the early 1990s under head coach Despite their record and ranking, the Huskies were a slight underdog to Purdue.\nPurdue Boilermakers.\nThe Big Ten champion Purdue Boilermakers were led by quarterback Drew Brees. They did not have a particularly auspicious start, winning against Central Michigan and Kent State before losing at Notre Dame. They defeated Minnesota, but then lost at struggling Penn State. The Boilermakers made surprising wins in October starting with Michigan, at Northwestern, at Wisconsin, and finishing with Ohio State. A 30-10 drubbing at the hands of Michigan State set them back, but a win over Indiana and losses by Michigan and Ohio State left them in a three-way tie with Northwestern and Michigan. Purdue got the Rose Bowl invitation by virtue of the head-to-head victories over both teams.\nAftermath.\nWashington, led by senior quarterback Marques Tuiasosopo, the Rose Bowl MVP, finished the season at and was ranked third in the final polls. Rick Neuheisel became the only former Rose Bowl MVP to win a Rose Bowl as head coach.\nOregon State and Oregon both won their bowl games, and the final rankings were Washington 3rd, Oregon State 4th, and Oregon 7th in the final AP poll. Oklahoma, who was undefeated and beat Florida State in the Orange Bowl, was named the national champion. Washington's victory broke a four-game win streak by the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl.\nThis was Purdue's second Rose Bowl appearance, as both of Purdue's starting Rose Bowl quarterbacks (Bob Griese and Brees) eventually started and won the Super Bowl."

It was a match-up between the Oklahoma Sooners and the Washington State Cougars. Oklahoma led 27–0 in the fourth quarter and won, 34–14. Sooner quarterback Nate Hybl was named the Player Of The Game.\nPre-Game Activities.\nThe Pasadena Tournament of Roses chooses their co-Grand Marshals of the 114th annual Rose Parade, they are: Actor/Comedian Bill Cosby, Art Linkletter and Fred Rogers from Mister Rogers' Neighborhood on PBS.\nOn Tuesday, October 22, 2002 - Tournament of Roses President Gary L. Thomas selects 17-year-old Alexandra Wucetich, a senior at San Marino High School &amp; a resident of San Marino, California to become the 85th Rose Queen to reign over the 114th Tournament of Roses Parade and the 89th Rose Bowl Game.\nMembers of the court are: Princesses Anjali Agrawal, Arcadia, La Salle High School; Heather Bell, Pasadena, John Muir High School; Katherine Berber, San Marino, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy; Glynn Joseph, Altadena, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy; Megan Maclennan, Pasadena, Polytechnic School; and Danielle Yamamoto, La Canada Flintridge, La Canada High School.\nTeams.\nPrior to the BCS, this pairing never would have occurred. Oklahoma came into the game Big 12 Champions, while Washington State came in co-champions of the Pac-10. The Rose Bowl normally features the champions of the Big Ten and the Pac-10. However, because the Buckeyes had finished second in the BCS, they were set to play in the Fiesta Bowl for the national championship against the Miami Hurricanes. Earlier in the season, Ohio State had defeated Washington State 25–7.\nThe Orange Bowl had the next pick after the Fiesta Bowl pairing, and #3 (#5 BCS) Iowa was chosen. The Rose Bowl had the next BCS selection. The next, best available team to choose was #8 (#7 BCS) Oklahoma, who won the Big 12 Championship Game, to play Pac-10 winner Washington State. When it came time for the Orange Bowl and Sugar Bowl to make a second pick, both wanted the fifth-ranked USC Trojans. However, a BCS rule stated that if two bowls want the same team, the bowl with the higher payoff has the option. The Orange Bowl immediately extended an at-large bid to the Trojans and paired them with at-large number 3 Iowa in a Big Ten/Pac-10 \"Rose Bowl\" matchup in the Orange Bowl. Rose Bowl committee executive director Mitch Dorger was not pleased with the results. This left the Sugar Bowl with #14 BCS Florida State, the winner of the Atlantic Coast Conference. Notre Dame at 10–2 and #9 in the BCS standings was invited to the Gator Bowl. Kansas State at #8 also was left out.\nOklahoma Sooners.\nThe Sooners won the Big 12 South and defeated Colorado in the Big 12 Championship Game. Kansas State, although ranked higher in the AP poll, lost to Colorado in the Big 12 North, and could not play in the championship game.\nAftermath.\nThis game drew one of the lowest attendance numbers in the modern history of the Rose Bowl. It was the first time that the stadium held less than the nominal capacity for the Rose Bowl game since before the 1947 Rose Bowl and the agreement between the Pacific Coast and Big Ten conferences. The 1944 game had the third smallest crowd played in the Rose Bowl stadium at 68,000. The 1931 edition had the second smallest crowd at 60,000. The smallest crowd at the Rose Bowl stadium was the 1934 Rose Bowl at 35,000. Former University of Michigan coach Bo Schembechler remarked, \"Didn't watch it,\" when asked what he thought of this game and also about the Nebraska-Miami Rose Bowl the previous year\nDuring the early 2010s cycle of conference realignment, the Pac-10 eyed six Big 12 members as possible additions to the conference, including Oklahoma. However, the only Big 12 school that did join the Pac-10 (now the Pac-12) was Colorado."

        "text": "The 2004 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game held on January 1, 2004 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. It was the 90th Rose Bowl Game. The USC Trojans, champions of the Pacific-10 Conference, defeated the Michigan Wolverines, champions of the Big Ten Conference, 28-14. USC quarterback Matt Leinart was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game.\nThe events leading up to the 2004 Rose Bowl were the subject of controversy. Although USC was ranked #1 in both the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll, the Trojans finished #3 in the final BCS standings due to a weaker schedule and one defeatto unranked Californiaduring the regular season, and thus did not qualify to go the BCS National Championship Game, played in the 2004 Sugar Bowl. Meanwhile, the Oklahoma Sooners played a stronger schedule in their undefeated regular season, but lost on December 5, 2003 in the 2003 Big 12 Championship Game to the #8-ranked Kansas State Wildcats. By virtue of their dominance through the entire regular season, Oklahoma remained #1 in the final BCS rankings issued at the outset of the bowl season. Oklahoma would lose, 21-14, to the LSU Tigers, #2 in both polls and the BCS rankings, in the Sugar Bowl game.\nPre-Game Activities.\nOn October 21, 2003 – Tournament of Roses President Michael K. Riffey chose 17-year-old Megan Chinen, a senior at La Salle High School &amp; a resident of Pasadena, California to become the 86th Rose Queen to reign over the 115th Rose Parade and the 90th Rose Bowl Game on New Year's Day.\nThe game was presided over by the 2004 Tournament of Roses Royal Court and the Rose Parade Grand Marshal John Williams. Members of the court were: Princesses Stephanie Barnes, La Canada Flintridge, La Canada High School; Katherine Koch, Pasadena, John Marshall Fundamental High School; Erinne La Brie, Arcadia, Arcadia High School; Natalie Matsumoto, San Marino, San Marino High School; Christina Mills, Pasadena, La Salle High School; and Lauren Stassel, La Canada Flintridge, Flintridge Sacred Heart Academy.\nTeams.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nMichigan opened at home in 2003 winning big over Central Michigan and Houston. A 38-0 shutout of Notre Dame propelled the Wolverines to a #3 ranking, but they lost the next week at Oregon, 31-27. Michigan bounced back to beat Indiana, but then lost another close road game at Iowa, 30-27. Michigan played next on a Friday evening, October 10, at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in a battle for the Little Brown Jug against Minnesota. Minnesota came into the game ranked #17 and Michigan was ranked #20 in one of the most highly anticipated Michigan-Minnesota matchups in years. Down 21 points at the beginning of the fourth quarter, Michigan put together its greatest comeback in school history to win 38-35. The Wolverines won their next four games over Illinois, #10 Purdue, #9 Michigan State, and Northwestern and rose to #5 in the rankings before their annual showdown with the Ohio State Buckeyes. In front of a record crowd of 112,118 at Michigan Stadium, the Wolverines beat the #4 ranked Buckeyes 35-21 to win the Big Ten championship outright.\nUSC Trojans.\nThe Trojans opened the season winning at #6 Auburn, 23-0. Their only loss of the season was a triple overtime loss at Cal, 34-31 on September 27. Later in the season, USC beat Notre Dame 45-14, scoring the most points allowed by the Irish in since 1960, and routed Arizona 45-0 in the first shutout of the Wildcats in 146 games.\nGame summary.\nFormer University of Michigan coach Bo Schembechler was in attendance, and remarked, \"Didn't watch it\", when asked what he thought of the 2003 game and also about the Nebraska-Miami Rose Bowl in 2002. The Trojans wore a \"54\" sticker to commemorate Drean Rucker, an incoming freshman linebacker who drowned in July 2003. Former USC Trojans safety Troy Polamalu also was in attendance and was on the USC sideline. He was also shown embracing coach Pete Carroll at the game's end.\nAftermath.\nLSU defeated Oklahoma 21-14 in the Sugar Bowl. The Coaches Poll chose the winner of that game, the LSU Tigers, as the BCS National Champions. The AP Poll, however, selected the Rose Bowl champion USC Trojans resulting in the first split national title since the 1997–98 season, the year before the creation of the Bowl Championship Series, and the only split title of the BCS era. The BCS ranking formula was immediately reworked and simplified to place greater emphasis on the human polls to avoid a repeat scenario."

In 1928, Larsson competed in the Winter Olympics in St. Moritz with Sweden, and won the silver medal. In total, Larsson played 11 international games for his country. He is a recipient of the honorary award Stora Grabbars Märke, handed out by the Swedish Ice Hockey Association.

The Australian Rugby Union (ARU) disputed Jones-Hughes' selection because he had already played for the Australian Barbarians, who were considered Australia's \"de facto\" second team. This led to a protracted legal battle over Jones-Hughes' eligibility for Wales, in which the International Rugby Board initially ruled in Australia's favour; on appeal, Wales were allowed to select Jones-Hughes, but the ARU refused to release him from his contract with New South Wales.

        "text": "The Lega Pallavolo Serie A is structured in several levels of importance; the highest of them is \"SuperLega\" (formerly \"Serie A1\"). Since the early 1980s, many among the best volleyball players in the world play in Superlega and the overall level of competition is considerably high. Nowadays, the SuperLega is widely considered the best league in the world.\nStructure.\nAs of 2016–17 season, the Italian volleyball championships are parted in this way:\nSuperLega.\nSuperLega is the highest level club competition in Italian professional male volleyball. It is organized by Federazione Italiana Pallavolo (FIPAV) and Lega Pallavolo Serie A. It was known as Serie A between 1946 and 1977, then as Serie A1 until 2014.\nSince 1982, the championship consists of two phases:\nJust in few occasions relegation playouts were disputed.\nHistory.\nVolleyball made its first appearance in Italy after the end of World War I. In 1929 a \"Federazione Italiana Palla a Volo\" (FIPV) was founded. During the 1930s several tournaments were organized by youth or workers movements within fascist associations like GIL and OND.\nAfter the end of World War II and the overthrow of fascist regime, a new association, called \"Federazione Italiana Pallavolo\", were founded in 1946. Later that year the city of Genoa hosted the first official male championship.\nQuickly volleyball became popular in northern regions like Piedmont, Lombardy and especially Emilia-Romagna and Tuscany: clubs based on Ravenna, Modena, Parma, Bologna and Florence regularly won all the championships for more than thirty years. By the 1970s outsider clubs from centre-south cities (Rome, Catania) were more competitive.\nIn the 1980s the growth of Italy men's national volleyball team led volleyball to a peak of a popularity. After a period in which Turin's CUS and Parma's Santal dominated, great entrepreneurial companies (like Fininvest in Milan, Montedison in Ravenna and Benetton in Treviso) decided to support and invest in volleyball, equipping strong teams which often won European and Intercontinental trophies. \nDuring the 1990s and 2000s decades, Serie A1 was by far the best volleyball league in the world, due to the simultaneous presence of all Italian's golden generation members and even all the best foreign players from all over the world (Netherlands, Brazil, Cuba, Russia etc.). All along 1990s, Italian teams dominated all European club competitions and Serie A1 was called \"the NBA of volleyball\".\nSituation.\nToday Serie A1 is called SuperLega and it's still one of the most difficult and competitive leagues in the world. Italian volleyball is diffused all over the country but, as a consequence of the enormous popularity of other disciplines (football above all) in big cities, it finds its highest popularity in medium-to-large cities.\nChampions.\n1936–1941 (OND tournaments).\nThese tournaments were organized by the National Recreational Club (Opera Nazionale Dopolavoro).\nTeams.\nThe following teams compete in the SuperLega during 2022–23 season:\nSerie A2.\nSerie A2 is the second highest level club competition in Italian professional male volleyball. It is organized by Federazione Italiana Pallavolo (FIPAV) and Lega Pallavolo Serie A. It was created in 1977 by splitting the previous Serie A in two tiers (Serie A1 and Serie A2).\nExternal links.\n "

He would finish the season and, after being eliminated 2-1 in the semifinals, return to being head of Donar's youth division.\nOn 24 May 2021, the club announced former player Matthew Otten as the new head coach. Otten just finished his first season as head coach in the Dutch Basketball League, making it to the Cup Final with Yoast United in their first season in existence. Starting from the 2021–22 season, Donar plays in the newly formed BNXT League, in which the national leagues of Belgium and the Netherlands have merged. Despite a disappointing regular season and an early elimination in Europe and the national play-offs, Donar managed to win its 7th cup this season. Additionally, the finals of the new BNXT Playoffs were reached.\nAfter a disappointing start of the 2022–23 season, head coach Otten was fired and replaced by his assistant Andrej Štimac on 31 October. Under Stimac, Donar was able to turn around the season and was able to reach the finals of the Dutch League for a 13th time. In the series, Donar played ZZ Leiden once again, and narrowly lost the decisive Game 5 in Leiden. In the game, Donar was up by as much as 16 points with 2 minutes and 40 seconds on the clock, before giving up the lead. \nBankruptcy.\nFollowing the end of the season, in June 2023, the board of Donar came out with a statement that revealed the club was facing serious financial difficulties. At a press conference on 29 June, Donar was revealed to have outstanding debts approximating €1.75 million. A task force was appointed with the goal of saving the club for bankruptcy, who concluded there were insufficient check and balances in the organisation, and financial troubles had been ongoing for three years but were not reported, and that called on supporters and sponsors to invest in the club.\nAfter a month of efforts to keep the club alive, the board had to file for bankruptcy due to a high demand from the tax authorities. A trustee was appointed to investigate whether a restart is possible.\nThe restart was initiated by a group of investors, creating a new company under the name Donar Groningen BV. In addition, a new foundation under the name Wij zijn Donar was founded, which used the money collected by supporters to purchase shares from Donar Groningen BV. Donar Groningen BV bought the contracts and the BNXT license from the trustee in order to realize the restart while keeping the club at the highest level of Dutch basketball. However, whether the club was allowed to use the same license was still to be decided by the BNXT license committee.\nOn the 28th of August, on the same day of the local holiday of the relief of Groningen, the new management announced that Donar Groningen BV was allowed to use the same license and play in the BNXT League in the 2023/2024 season under a few conditions. The conditions entailed that no prior board member was allowed in the new management and they received a budget cap of two thirds of their prior budget.\nClub identity.\nNames.\nThe club has a rich history of names, mainly because of the different main sponsors of the team. Despite having been named differently in the past, \"Donar\" has always been used by supporters to describe the team and has been used in chants. Since 2014, the team plays under the non-sponsored name Donar.\nLogos.\nThe Donar logo introduced in 2014 features eagles, inspired by the coat of arms of the city of Groningen. In 2022, the foundation year was added to the logo. \nUniforms.\nTraditionally, Donar has played in white jerseys at home and in (navy) blue jerseys in away games.\nArenas.\nThe MartiniPlaza is the current home arena of Donar, since 2001. The arena is owned by the municipality Groningen which has a cooperation agreement with the club.\nBecause of unavailability in 2017 for their European games, Donar played one game in Leek (against ESSM Le Portel) and one game in Leeuwarden (against Estudiantes).\nThe MartiniPlaza has a stand named after the club's legendary players Jason Dourisseau (since 2014) as well as after Thomas Koenis (since 2022).\nHonours.\nTotal titles: 16\nSeason by season.\nEuropean record.\nDonar has played in Europe since the 1974–75 season, when it made its debut in the 1974–75. On 5 November 1974, Donar played its first European game away against Luxembourg club Etzella, winning 78–110.\nDonar played in the qualifying rounds of the EuroLeague once, losing in the first qualifying round of the 2010–11 season to UNICS Kazan.\nThe best performance of the team was reaching the semi-finals of the 2017–18 FIBA Europe Cup, losing to Italian champions and later winners Reyer Venezia. Donar reached the knockout stage of the FIBA Europe Cup twice (2018 and 2019). They have played in the qualifying rounds of the Basketball Champions League five times (from 2016 to 2020), without qualifying.\nSupporters club.\nThe current supporters club was founded on August 26, 1997, under the name \"Vikings\", a nod to the Norse god Donar (Thor). After the club lost Donar from its name, this link became less clear. In 2010 it was decided to change the name of the supporters club to SV Donar (Supporters club Donar). The supporters club had 330 members as of the start of season 2010–11."

The course occupies land previously held by Clan Colquhoun and includes the clan's seat of Rossdhu House as its clubhouse.\nHistory.\nWhile Clan Colquhoun had occupied the site of the present club since ancient times, the medieval Rossdhu Castle was constructed by Sir John Colquhoun in 1457 along with the private chapel of St. Mary of Rossdhu when his lands were consolidated into the free Barony of Luss. \"Rossdhu\" is derived from the Scottish Gaelic \"\", meaning the \"black headland\".\nMary, Queen of Scots visited in 1563 and her household ate a fish supper on 17 July including salmon, ling, and trout cooked in butter. The castle was ruined in a fire after the construction of Rossdhu Mansion (ruins can be seen directly behind the course's 18th green).\nThe central portion of the present house, known as Rossdhu Mansion, was completed in 1773. The grand Georgian manor house was constructed by Sir James Colquhoun and was likely designed by well-known architect John Baxter to replace the 15th-century castle, though no documentation survives. This was the family seat when Sir James Colquhoun, 3rd Baronet led the clan and the writer Janet Colquhoun was his wife.\nUntil the late 1970s, the house was home to Sir Ivar Colquhoun, 8th Baronet, and Lady Colquhoun. They loaned many original pieces of furniture and artwork to the restored manor house in 1994, thus assuring that Rossdhu Mansion would be historically preserved notwithstanding ownership by the club.\nAccommodations.\nThe club also has a total of 43 suites, located at the Carriage House, Garden Cottages, The Point, and the Loch Shore Lodges for members and their guests staying overnight. This provides increased revenue for the club, as it can stay open throughout the year as a luxury hotel and accommodate visitors for long stays despite the countryside location. Amenities for members and their guests include a pro shop, locker rooms, an on-site health club built inside a historical walled garden which opened in September 2006, two formal dining rooms, and a casual bar and grill. Additional outdoor activities include boat tours of Loch Lomond, fitness programs, hiking, bicycle riding, clay shooting, and game hunting.\nGolf course.\nDesigned by Tom Weiskopf and Jay Morrish, the course is considered to be among the 100 finest golf courses in the world. In 2005 it was ranked 66th (ranked by \"Golf Magazine\"). Opened in 1993, the course makes heavy use of natural hazards such as streams and marshland areas.\nLoch Lomond hosted the Scottish Open on the European Tour for ten seasons (from 2001 through 2010; succeeded by Castle Stuart), and European Tour events in each of the previous five seasons."

He retired in 2012 and started to coach Benfica Under 18 team.\nNowadays he is the head coach of Os Belenenses Senior on the Proliga League.\nFirst steps as a professional.\nPossibly the most talented Portuguese basketball player of his generation, he played mostly for Benfica in Portugal - after being league champion with Estrelas da Avenida. With some lack of luck, he became a professional player right after the ending of the Golden Era of the basketball team of Benfica. In any case, he still won three trophies as young player, before leaving his favourite club to go play abroad, in the fantastic Serie A, for Adecco Milano.\nCareer abroad.\nAt the age of 24, Sérgio left his country and went to Adecco Milano to play in the Serie A.

        "title": "Georgia Bulldogs basketball",
        "text": "The Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team representing the University of Georgia in Athens, Georgia. Established in 1891, the team has competed in the Southeastern Conference since its inception in 1932. As of 2020 the Bulldogs have amassed a record of 1,434–1,319. Though it has been historically overshadowed by the school's football program, the Bulldogs' basketball squad has had its share of successes, including a trip to the NCAA Final Four in 1983 under head coach Hugh Durham.\nHistory.\nConference affiliations.\nGeorgia was a founding member of the Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association (SIAA), the first collegiate athletic conference formed in the United States. Georgia participated in the SIAA from its establishment in 1895 until 1921. In 1921, the Bulldogs, along with 12 other teams, left the SIAA and formed the Southern Conference. In 1932, the Georgia Bulldogs left the Southern Conference to form and join the Southeastern Conference (SEC).\n1931–1932.\nCoach Rex Enright led Georgia to great success in the old Southern Conference during the 1931 and 1932 seasons. His 1931 team finished with a 23–2 (15–1) record. The Bulldogs were upset in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals by Maryland, 26–25.\nThe 1932 team didn't have the dominating record that the 1931 team did, finishing 19–7 (7–4). However, this team did something that the previous year's team could not do in winning the Southern Conference tournament defeating Mississippi State, Virginia, Duke, and North Carolina.\n1981–1982.\nCoach Hugh Durham brought Georgia to its first ever postseason appearance in 1981. That team finished with a 19–12 (9–9) record. They earned a National Invitation Tournament (NIT) bid and the enthusiasm surrounding the program earned them home games in first defeating Old Dominion and then in a loss to South Alabama.\nThe 1982 Bulldogs were 19–12 (10–8) were once again NIT bound. This time UGA made it all the way to the NIT Final Four defeating Temple, Maryland, and Virginia Tech before losing a heartbreaker to Purdue at Madison Square Garden.\nThese two teams marked the beginning of a postseason streak of eight straight seasons, longest in Georgia basketball history. This string included three NCAA appearances (including one Final Four in 1983) and five NIT bids. This was a remarkable streak of consistency for a program that had never before experienced the postseason beyond the SEC tournament.\n1983.\nFormer NBA star Dominique Wilkins is considered the greatest player in school history. However, Wilkins never played in the NCAA tournament; the Bulldogs made their first NCAA appearance in 1983—which would have been Wilkins' senior year had he not opted for the NBA. The 1983 team made it to the Final Four of the NCAA Championship before being eliminated by eventual champion North Carolina State. On the way to the Final Four, UGA defeated Virginia Commonwealth, #3 St. John's led by legendary coach Lou Carneseca and Chris Mullin, and defending national champion North Carolina led by Dean Smith and featuring Michael Jordan, Sam Perkins, and Brad Daugherty. The latter two victories coming at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. UGA previously had won the Southeastern Conference tournament in Birmingham, Alabama, defeating Ole Miss, Tennessee, and Alabama to earn the league's automatic bid into the NCAA tournament.\n1987.\nThe 1987 Georgia basketball team had multiple key players injured during the season, leaving the team with only seven players on the roster. Coach Hugh Durham had no choice but to alter the playing style of his team after conference play had started, slowing the game down and \"taking the air out of the ball.\" What looked to be a disastrous season, where the team might not win another game, turned into an inspiring one as the team rallied to an 18–12 (10–8) record and earning an NCAA tournament bid. When Durham ordered the NCAA tournament banner to be displayed at Stegeman Coliseum, he had it made in silver, rather than the traditional red, with the initials \"TMW\" at the bottom. The initials standing for what this team will forever be known as in UGA basketball history, \"The Miracle Workers.\"\n1996–1998.\nTubby Smith led the Bulldogs to a 21–10 (9–7) record securing its first NCAA bid since the 1991 season. Georgia made the most of it by defeating Clemson and the West Regional's top seed, Purdue, in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before losing a heart stopping overtime game to Syracuse in the Sweet 16.\nIn 1997, Georgia finished 23–9 (10–6) winning the prestigious Rainbow Classic holiday tournament in Hawaii, defeating Washington State, Memphis, and Maryland. UGA beat LSU, South Carolina, and Arkansas to advance to the SEC tournament final in Memphis, losing the final to Kentucky. \nSmith's successor, Ron Jirsa, led the 1998 Bulldogs to a 21–14 (8–8) record, reaching the 20 win mark for the third consecutive year for the first time in Georgia basketball history. They would go on to reach the 1998 NIT Final Four winning at Iowa, at North Carolina State, and beating Vanderbilt at home.\n2008 SEC Tournament: The Dream Dawgs.\nIn the 2007–2008 season, Georgia's men's basketball team came into the 2008 SEC men's basketball tournament with a 13–16 overall record and a 4–12 conference mark. At one point, the team sustained two five-game losing streaks during a 2-of-12 stretch in conference play. In the first round of the tournament, Georgia was slated to play Ole Miss, who had beaten the Bulldogs in the season-closer, securing the Rebels' only road SEC win of the season. The game went into overtime after Rebel David Huertas hit all three free throws after a three-point shooting foul, and looked to go into a second extra period after Chris Warren did the same. However, with 0.4 seconds left in overtime, Georgia senior Dave Bliss banked in the game-winner to shock the Rebels and send Georgia into a second-round matchup with Kentucky.\nOn the night of March 14, 2008, tornadoes hit Atlanta, in whose Georgia Dome the SEC Tournament was housed. The Georgia-Kentucky matchup was rescheduled for the early afternoon of March 15, 2008, with the winner advancing to play the SEC West's #1 seed, Mississippi State, later that evening. The remaining games in the tournament would be played at Alexander Memorial Coliseum, the basketball complex of Georgia Tech, UGA's in-state rival. Again playing an overtime game in which Georgia star Sundiata Gaines fouled out, Georgia freshman Zac Swansey hit a turnaround three-point jumper with 1.4 seconds left to give the Bulldogs the team's first ever win over Kentucky in the SEC Tournament. That night, Georgia defeated Mississippi State 64–60 to become the first team since Kentucky in 1952 to win two tournament games in one day, and the first-ever #6 seed from a division to advance to the modern (post-1992) SEC tournament finals.\nIn the finals, Georgia faced Arkansas, which had lost to Georgia 82–69 in the regular season. Georgia prevailed again, at one point leading the Razorbacks by nineteen points en route to winning its first tournament championship in 25 years. Sundiata Gaines and Terrance Woodbury were both named to the All-Tournament Team, with Gaines winning the tournament's MVP. The improbable list of achievements—winning the tournament as a 6-seed, playing two games in one day to reach the finals, playing two games (against Kentucky and Mississippi State) in which Gaines fouled out with a substantial amount of time to play, doing it on a rival's home court, and winning four consecutive elimination games following a season during which their longest winning streak stood at three—earned the 2007–2008 team the nickname of Dream Dawgs.\nWith the victory, Georgia secured itself an automatic bid in the 2008 NCAA tournament. Georgia's appearance in the tournament was the tenth overall in team history and the first since the 2002 NCAA basketball tournament. After their SEC Championship run, the Bulldogs were seeded 14th in the NCAA Tournament, playing against the #3 seeded Xavier Musketeers. After developing a lead early in the 2nd half, the Bulldogs could not hold on, as Xavier went on to win 73–61.\nCoach Dennis Felton failed to follow up the surprise successes of 2008 with victories in 2008–09, and he was fired on January 29, 2009.\n2009–2018: Mark Fox era.\nOn April 3, 2009, Nevada head coach Mark Fox was announced as the next head coach of the Bulldogs.\nIn nine seasons with Fox, the Bulldogs posted a 163–133 record and made the NCAA tournament twice, in 2011 and 2015. In both instances, the Bulldogs exited in the Round of 64.\nFox was fired on March 10, 2018 following an 18–15 finish to the 2017–18 season as the Bulldogs failed to qualify for any postseason competition.\n2018–2022: Tom Crean era.\nOn March 15, 2018, former Marquette and Indiana head coach Tom Crean was announced as the next head coach of the Bulldogs.\nAnthony Edwards, first overall pick of the 2020 NBA draft, played his only year of college basketball for the Bulldogs in 2019-20.\n2022–present: Mike White era.\nOn March 13, 2022, former Florida head coach Mike White was announced as the next head coach of the Bulldogs.\nTeam awards and records.\nConference championships.\nGeorgia has won one regular-season Southeastern Conference championship (1990) and two conference tournament championships (1983 and 2008). The Bulldogs were SEC Eastern Division co-Champs in 1994–1995. Georgia also was the Southern Conference champions for 1931–1932.\nConference affiliations:\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Bulldogs have appeared in the NCAA tournament 12 times.

        "text": "The 2003 State of Origin series was the 22nd year that the annual three-game series between Queensland and New South Wales was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. Queensland's return to a renovated Lang Park was soured when Andrew Johns returned to form for New South Wales in devastating fashion.\nArnold Schwarzenegger appeared in television promotions for the 2003 series. Blues coach Phil Gould sparked controversy before the series had even started when he slammed the form of his champion half-back Johns in his \"Sun-Herald\" column. Gould claimed that Johns had lost his \"self-confidence\" in an attack that caused outrage from all corners, including Johns himself, who had words with Gould at a pre-Origin briefing. But in the end it was psychology that worked, as 2003 was Johns' best ever series performance.\nGame I.\nIn Game I, Andrew Johns spoiled what was supposed to be a party time for the Queenslanders, who returned to their spiritual home of Suncorp Stadium formerly known as Lang Park. The ground was quickly nicknamed the \"Sand Pit\" as its sandy surface was constantly shifting under the feet of players. Both Maroons centres Justin Hodges and Paul Bowman, were taken from the field with serious knee injuries which were later blamed on the shifting surface.\nThe Blues pack led by interchange prop Luke Bailey, hammered their Maroons counterparts and gave Johns plenty of room to weave his magic. Johns contributed 13 points to the tally while Anthony Minichiello scored a try double.\nGame II.\nThe series was virtually decided by half-time of game II after the Blues raced to a 17–0 lead. Johns was again the catalyst starting the scoring with a brilliant banana kick that rebounded off the cross bar, went through the hands of Michael De Vere and fell to the ground before Ben Kennedy pounced.\nThere was no greater example of the brilliant halfback's influence than the last minute before the break. Johns kicked for touch from a 20-metre restart, then after winning the ensuing scrum, hoisted a bomb high into the air which was contested before being batted back into his hands. Without a second thought and while on the run, he potted a 25-metre field goal with ease.\nThe final score was 27–4 to the Blues who remained unbeaten from seven matches on their home turf of Telstra Stadium.\nGame III.\nGame III, a \"dead rubber\", restored some much needed pride for the Maroons who dominated the Blues in every facet of the game. Winger Matt Sing was superb, scoring three tries in a man-of-the match performance.\nQueensland started with a new-found zest and led 16-0 after just 17 minutes before strangling the Blues out of the contest.

T Murari, Major YVK Murthy and Capt. MG Vijayasarathi were instrumental in getting the KSCA affiliated to the BCCI. JC Rollo, an Englishman, was the first president of the Association. The association was initially housed in a small room in the pavilion of Central college. In the 1950s and 1960s, the association was headed by SA Srinivasan and M.Chinnswamy. In 1975, KSCA made its home in KSCA stadium, where it is housed currently. Bangalore hosted its first ever international test match in the same year against the visiting West Indies. This cricket stadium, earlier named KSCA stadium is now named after Mr. M. Chinnaswamy, who was the Hon. Secretary of the association from 1953 to 1978 and remained the president till 1990.\nMysore state (which was renamed Karnataka in 1973) played its first Ranji trophy match on 4 November 1934 against Madras state (now Tamil Nadu).

        "title": "UEFA Champions League Anthem",
        "text": "The UEFA Champions League Anthem, officially titled simply \"Champions League\", is the official anthem of the UEFA Champions League, written by English composer Tony Britten in 1992, and based on George Frideric Handel's \"Zadok the Priest\". It was also the official anthem of the UEFA Women's Champions League from its creation in 2001 to the 2021 creation of an independent anthem. The complete anthem is about three minutes long, and has two short verses and the chorus. The lyrics are in UEFA's three official languages: English, French, and German. The chorus is set to the exclamations \" The champions!\"\nThe anthem is played inside the stadium before the start of each UEFA Champions League match, in addition to the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the games. Special vocal versions of the anthem have been performed live at the UEFA Champions League Final. UEFA's official website states, \"the anthem is now almost as iconic as the trophy.\"\nComposition.\nIn 1991, UEFA instructed its commercial partner Television Event and Media Marketing (TEAM) to develop new ways of branding the European Cup (which would be renamed the UEFA Champions League in 1992). This process resulted in the Champions League's anthem, as well as its \"starball\" logo and distinctive house colours.\nThe anthem was written by English composer Tony Britten in 1992, adapted from George Frideric Händel's anthem \"Zadok the Priest\", which is traditionally performed at the coronation of British monarchs. In a 2013 newspaper interview, Britten stated that \"I had a commercials agent and they approached me to write something anthemic and because it was just after The Three Tenors at the World Cup in Italy so classical music was all the rage. Hooliganism was a major, major problem and UEFA wanted to take the game into a completely different area altogether. There's a rising string phase which I pinched from Handel and then I wrote my own tune. It has a kind of Handelian feel to it but I like to think it's not a total rip-off.\" The composing process took \"just a matter of days\". Britten also mentioned that he does not own the rights to the anthem, which are retained by UEFA, but he receives royalties when it is used.\nFor the recording used in television transmissions of UEFA Champions League matches and events, the piece was performed by London's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and sung by the Academy of St Martin in the Fields Chorus. The chorus is in UEFA's three official languages: English, French, and German.\nAnthony King writes: \nUses.\nThe anthem's chorus is played before each UEFA Champions League game as the two teams are lined up, as well as at the beginning and end of television broadcasts of the matches, and when the winning team lifted the trophy after the final. Special vocal versions have been performed live at the Champions League Final with lyrics in other languages, changing over to the host country's language for the chorus. These versions were performed by: \nIn the 2013 final at Wembley Stadium, the chorus was played twice. In the 2018 and 2019 finals, held in Kyiv and Madrid respectively, the instrumental version of the chorus was played, by 2Cellos (2018) and Asturia Girls (2019), while the 2020 and 2021 finals used the pre-recorded anthem's chorus instead, without any live performances due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2022 final similarly used a standard pre-recorded version of the anthem. In the 2023 final, held in Istanbul, Hungarian pianist Ádám György performed the piano version of the anthem.\nThe complete anthem is about three minutes long and has two short verses and the chorus. In addition to the anthem, there is also entrance music, which contains parts of the anthem itself, which is played as teams enter the field. The anthem has been released commercially in its original version on iTunes and Spotify with the title of Champions League Theme. Also, the Academy of St Martin in the Fields chorus can be heard singing the influential piece \"Zadok the Priest\" on the 2002 album \"World Soccer Anthems\". In 2018, composer Hans Zimmer remixed the anthem with rapper Vince Staples for EA Sports' \"FIFA\" video game \"FIFA 19\", with it also featuring in the game's reveal trailer."

He was a walk-on who wanted to play linebacker, but Dickey discouraged it and said that the Gators needed more depth at strong safety, so Harrell set out to learn a position he had never played. He played for the Gators freshman team, and earned a scholarship at the end of his first season. When he returned for his second season he had beefed up from 185 pounds to 220, and Dickey asked him to move to defensive end. Still, he was not a starter, but he became a serious student and threw himself into his special teams play.

He then became assistant coach at 5A Edison High School in San Antonio.\nIn 1974 Danaher got his first head coaching job in Dilley, Texas, a class 2A school. During his first year, the Wolves won their first district championship in more than a decade and were named regional co-champions. Danaher left Dilley with a 25–15–2 record after four seasons for the head coaching position at Hamshire-Fannett High School, a 3A school. Danaher guided the Hamshire-Fannett Longhorns to a 43–22 record in six years, winning three district championships and advancing to the regional finals twice.\nDanaher's became the head coach at Calallen High School, a class 4A school at the time. He turned around a football program that had not reached the playoffs in 28 years, leading them to 12 state semi-finals appearances and two title games since. Beginning in 1988, Calallen had a state record 16 consecutive seasons with ten or more wins — twice as much as the previous record established by Yates High School from Houston, Texas in the 1960s.\nIn 2004 Danaher won his 300th high school game, making him only one of four coaches in Texas high school football history to do so. By 2010, Danaher ranked second in all-time Texas high school wins as a coach, trailing only the G. A. Moore's 426 wins. On November 3, 2016, Danaher's Calallen Wildcats defeated the Flour Bluff Hornets 31–7 in the District 30-5A InterZone Championship game, giving Danaher his 427th win, making him the winningest coach in Texas High School football history. \nCalallen's 2019 season ended December 7, 2019, in the Region 4 Final, a 49-42 loss to Boerne-Champion. Their 2019 record of 12-2, gives Danaher a career head coaching record of 470–113–4.\nPersonal.\nDanaher's son, Wes, played running back at Calallen from 1992 to 1995 and rushed for 8,855 yards, which trailed at the time only Ken Hall. As of 2018, he ranks 6th all-time for most rushing yards in a high school career. His other son, Cody, played quarterback at Calallen and went on to play at the University of Texas at Austin 1993-1996, where he backed up Shea Morenz and James Brown."

        "text": "Major League Baseball on Mutual was the de facto title of the Mutual Broadcasting System's (MBS) national radio coverage of Major League Baseball games. Mutual's coverage came about during the Golden Age of Radio in the 1930s, 1940s, and 1950s. During this period, television sports broadcasting was in its infancy, and radio was still the main form of broadcasting baseball. For many years, Mutual was the national radio broadcaster for baseball's All-Star Game and World Series.\nHistory of coverage.\nMutual started its baseball coverage in , when the network joined NBC and CBS in national radio coverage. The three networks continued to share coverage of baseball's \"jewels\" (the All-Star Game and World Series) in this manner through , with Mutual gaining exclusive rights to the World Series in 1939 and the All-Star Game in . In 1949, Commissioner Happy Chandler negotiated a seven-year, US$4,370,000 contract with the Gillette Safety Razor Company and the Mutual Broadcasting System for radio rights to the World Series, with the proceeds going directly into the pension fund. In , NBC replaced Mutual as the exclusive national radio broadcaster for the World Series and All-Star Game.\nFollowing the lead of the rival Liberty Broadcasting System, Mutual also aired regular-season \"Game of the Day\" broadcasts (a precursor to television's \"Game of the Week\" concept) to non-major-league cities throughout the 1940s and 1950s.\nAttempts at television coverage.\nIn 1950, Mutual acquired the television broadcast rights to the World Series and All-Star Game for the next six years. The network may have been re-indulging in TV network dreams or simply taking advantage of a long-standing business relationship; in either case, the broadcast rights were sold to NBC in time for the following season's games at an enormous profit.\nAnnouncers.\nWorld Series.\n1940s.\n Mutual also nationally broadcast the 1948 American League tie-breaker game. It did not air in Cleveland due to Indians owner Bill Veeck refusing to grant permission to Mutual affiliate WHK after MLB commissioner Happy Chandler selected Mel Allen for the Series coverage instead of either Cleveland announcer. Indians flagship WJW originated coverage of their own for the tie-breaker game.\nAll-Star Game.\n1940s.\nTwo nights following the 1942 All-Star Game, the American League All-Stars traveled to Cleveland Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, Ohio, to play a special benefit game against a team of players from the U.S. Army and Navy. The contest, which the American Leaguers won 5–0, attracted a crowd of 62,094 and netted $70,000 for the Army Emergency Relief Fund and the Navy Relief Society. Mutual Radio broadcast the second game, with Bob Elson, Waite Hoyt, and Jack Graney announcing."

The departure of three experienced starters left the Wildcats a young team with no seniors. Villanova replaced those starters with three freshmen: Parade All-American Corey Fisher, McDonald's All-American Corey Stokes, and Malcolm Grant. Returning players included sophomore Scottie Reynolds and juniors Shane Clark and Dante Cunningham. The team also featured Antonio Pena and Andrew Ott, both returning from redshirt freshman years.\nThe 2007–08 schedule included 18 Big East contests, a trip to Orlando, Florida for the Old Spice Classic, a home game against LSU in the Big East/SEC Invitational, four games against Big Five rivals, and home games against Stony Brook, Bucknell, Hartford, and Columbia.\nVillanova finished the regular season with a record of 19–11 overall and 9–9 in the Big East.\nThe Wildcats received a #12 seed in the 2008 NCAA tournament in which they defeated the #5 seed Clemson Tigers and the #13 seed Siena Saints. They reached the Sweet Sixteen before they were defeated by #1 seed Kansas 72–57 on March 28, 2008.

Listed at 6' 1\", 190 lb., he batted and threw left-handed.\nBorn in Galveston, Texas, Stevens was originally signed as a 16-year-old by the Dodgers. He played minor league ball in parts of four seasons before joining the big team in 1945.\nAs a rookie, he shared duties at first with incumbent Augie Galan, posting a .274 batting average with four home runs and 29 runs batted in in 55 games.\nStevens became a regular in 1946, ending with a .242 and 60 RBI in 103 games, while his 10 home runs were the second-highest on the team, being surpassed only by Pete Reiser (11).\nAlthough he had been the regular in that season, Stevens was replaced at first base by Jackie Robinson in 1947. He appeared in just five games and was sent to Triple-A Montreal Royals, where he hit .290 with 27 homers and 108 RBI in 133 games.

        "text": "The 1996 State of Origin series saw the 15th time that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. This series saw the return to representative football of players who had signed with Super League, after a court decision had delayed the beginning of Super League until at least 2000. As a result, both teams were back to full strength, and a new record was set for the highest State of Origin crowd at the Sydney Football Stadium.\nNew South Wales were able to bounce back from the 3 - 0 whitewash of the 1995 Series and win the 1996 series 3 - 0, reversing the result of the previous year. The first send off in Origin history occurred in 1996 and New South Wales made further history as the first side to go through a complete series without a player change.\nGame I.\nThe Blues came out in the opener at Suncorp Stadium with all guns blazing, as the Maroons were overwhelmed all over the park and went down 14-6. If everything had gone their way though, the Blues would have finished streets ahead.\nThe decision by the selectors to go in with the 1995 World Cup halfback and hooker combination of Andrew Johns and Geoff Toovey was the spark that ignited the Blues. Up front New South Wales simply out muscled their opponents with Glenn Lazarus putting in an extraordinary performance. Despite the fact unlimited interchange was in force for the first time in Origin, Lazarus stayed on the paddock for the full 80 minutes.\nWendell Sailor was brilliant for the Maroons on debut, their most attacking player, but the partnership of Allan Langer and Jason Smith in the halves didn't work and the Queenslanders' ball control was poor. Tim Brasher, chosen at fullback with Brett Mullins forced to the wing, justified his selection with a brilliant performance, while Paul Harragon was inspirational up front with Lazarus.\nGame II.\nThe Blues comfortably wrapped up the series with an 18-6 win in game II at the Sydney Football Stadium, with Laurie Daley and Andrew Ettingshausen demonstrating repeatedly all the skills and speed that stamped them as Origin greats.\nThe game was marred by the first send-off in State of Origin history when Queensland replacement forward Craig Greenhill was marched for a high tackle on Blues prop Paul Harragon. A specially convened State of Origin judiciary suspended him for four matches.\nBlues coach Phil Gould said after the game that New South Wales could make some history of their own by being the first side to go through an entire Origin series unchanged. His prediction proved correct.\nGame III.\nThe Blues skipped away to a 15-2 lead halfway through game III and with only eight minutes remaining it appeared all was lost for the Langer-led Queenslanders. Blues captain Brad Fittler had earlier potted a field goal which seemed to be almost an indulgence at the time, though in the end it proved crucial as the Maroons came storming home.\nFirst Mark Coyne managed to somehow produce a try after the ball ricocheted off his boot, then Matt Sing made a break to put speedy winger Brett Dallas over. At 15-14 the Queenslanders suddenly had a full head of steam. With seconds remaining Langer put on a cross-field kick which was pounced on by Coyne. The Suncorp Stadium crowd went into a frenzy thinking that Coyne had pulled off another miracle Origin try but referee David Manson looked to this touch judge who ruled that Coyne had been in front of the kicker."

        "title": "1995 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1995 State of Origin series was the 14th annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league teams. Due to the Australian Rugby League's ongoing conflicts with Super League, they ruled that no Super League-aligned players were eligible for State of Origin selection in 1995. This appeared to hurt Queensland, eliminating their mostly Brisbane Broncos back line, and they were not widely expected to win the series. However, they won 3–0, their first series win since 1991. Novice Queensland coach Paul Vautin made only one player change to his squad during the three game series.\nThis series once again saw State of Origin football venture to Melbourne, after an enthusiastic Melbourne crowd packed the MCG to watch game two of the 1994 series. Although the crowd in Melbourne was not as high as 1994's then-record origin crowd of 87,161, it was still a success, attracting 52,994 spectators and furthering the case for a first grade team in Melbourne.\nBrisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett had originally been appointed as Queensland coach for 1995 taking over from Wally Lewis. He stepped down from the job, stating that Queensland would be uncompetitive without its Super League players. Paul Vautin, who had played 22 Origin games for Queensland between 1982 and 1990 (including two games as captain in the absence of Lewis), was brought in to replace him.\nGame I.\nUnable to draw on the vast talents of the Brisbane Broncos whose Super League-aligned players were made ineligible for the Origin series by the Australian Rugby League, the Maroons selectors were forced to choose from a limited selection of Queenslanders from ARL-loyal clubs. Consequently, going into Game 1 at the Sydney Football Stadium, the Blues were unbackable favourites with nine internationals in the squad compared to Queensland's two in Dale Shearer and Papua New Guinea halfback Adrian Lam who had to be given dispensation to play for Qld, and an untested commentator-turned-coach in Paul Vautin. Although many considered NSW favourites, the starting sides in Game 1 actually saw Qld have 79 collective Origin games experience, while NSW had only 68 between them.\nAfter the first ever try-less State of Origin match, the Maroons left the ground having produced one of the biggest boilovers in rugby league history. A sole penalty goal to Maroons hooker Wayne Bartrim after 30 minutes was enough to see Vautin's unfancied Queensland team home 2–0. Referee Eddie Ward penalised Blues front rower Paul Harragon for a tackle on Gary Larson and Bartrim kicked the goal from 25 metres out. At the time it seemed a minor event but by game's end the goal had become pivotal.\nNew South Wales failed to capitalise on their chances, crossing the Queensland line twice. First winger Rod Wishart stepped into touch after taking a cross-field kick from Andrew Johns. Then in the second half, Blues centre Terry Hill was held up by Queensland debutante winger Matt Sing over the line with 17 minutes to play. It was the lowest ever score in a representative game in Australia, yet still a compelling spectacle as the underdog Maroons repelled the New South Wales attack time and time again.\nFrom this match came a moment for the annals of Origin tradition when broadcast sound and vision captured the indelible image of Maroons lock Billy Moore exiting the Sydney Football Stadium tunnel after half-time chanting the Maroons' war cry \"Queenslander\" over and over to exhort his team-mates.\nGame II.\nGoing into the second game, Qld suffered a blow when Dale Shearer, their most experienced player (having played 25 games since making his Origin debut in 1985) and only Australian test representative, was ruled out with injury. His place in the side was taken by 1994 Kangaroo tourist Jason Smith. Smith, who had initially signed with Super League earlier in the year, had turned his back on the rebels and had only recently re-signed with the ARL. Playing at rather than his usual position of , Smith won the Man of the Match award.\nRumours of an all-in brawl that had circulated before Game II at the Melbourne Cricket Ground were realised early when the first scrum erupted into violence after NSW Jim Serdaris started throwing punches at his opposite Wayne Bartrim. Almost like it was rehearsed, most players from both sides became involved and it took referee Eddie Ward a considerable time to restore order (in the confusion, Ward also failed to stop the game clock and almost 5 minutes elapsed before time was called off). During the brawl there were two main groups. Rival back rowers David Barnhill and Billy Moore waged their own private war throwing a lot of punches that missed their mark before wrestling each other to the ground, while Origin's old cry of \"Mate against mate\" added another chapter when Manly-Warringah teammates John Hopoate (NSW) and Danny Moore (Qld) squared off after Moore came to Matt Sing's aid. Another outbreak late in the half saw props Paul Harragon and Gavin Allen marched to the sin bin.\nQueensland had the run of play and again shocked their highly fancied rivals by racing to an 8–0 lead on the back of a Mark Coyne try and two goals from Wayne Bartrim. Blues captain Brad Fittler worked hard to lift his troops but again he found his team out enthused by Paul Vautin's patched-together but spirited combination.\nWith five minutes remaining, Jim Serdaris scored a converted try to close the gap to 14-12 and the Blues began a final wave of attack. Steve Menzies then came within inches of scoring the match winner but was held up, and then Fittler threw what appeared to be the match winning pass to a try-bound Tim Brasher. However referee Ward ruled the pass forward. As they dropped their guard, flying Queensland winger Brett Dallas caught them out in the dying seconds and ran 90 metres from dummy-half, easily out pacing Hopoate, Brasher and Rod Wishart coming across in cover, to score under the posts and seal the series with a 20–12 victory to give Qld what many believe to be the biggest boilover in Origin history.\nGame III.\nExperts were still favouring a New South Wales win in game III, but again they were proved wrong in a match that lived up to Origin expectations. Manly captain Geoff Toovey was called into the NSW side after injury kept him out of the first two games of the series. The chances of popular Maroons' captain Trevor Gillmeister playing in the final game had looked impossible - he had been admitted to hospital with an infected knee and placed on an intravenous drip. In an inspiring gesture that underlined the ferocity of feeling in the side he signed himself out to take his place in the team.\nThe two combatants punched and counter-punched before a late try to the previously unheralded Gold Coast rookie Ben Ikin gave the Maroons a 24–16 win and a 3–0 series whitewash. New South Wales led twice at 10-6 after 35 minutes and again 16-12 after 41 minutes, but the Queensland spirit was resolute. The series was career defining for Ikin, a Gold Coast junior who became the youngest player in Origin history at 18 years and 83 days when he debuted in Game I. He would later become a mainstay of Queensland and Broncos' sides up until 2003 although his career was disrupted by injury.\nMany considered Queensland lucky to play the last 52 minutes of the match with a full team after prop forward Tony Hearn appeared to headbutt NSW prop Mark Carroll in the 28th minute. In retaliation Carroll started throwing punches at Hearn which led to another all in brawl. Remarkably, referee David Manson only put Hearn on report and then penalised Carroll for the use of a forearm while tackling Hearn and awarded a penalty to Qld. Hearn was later suspended for 8 games by the ARL judiciary as a result of his headbutt. After his performances for Qld in the first two games, the front row forward from North Sydney had allegedly been in line for an Australian test jumper before his suspension.\nAfter the game, Gillmeister returned to hospital to continue treatment on his knee."

        "text": "The North Alabama Lions men's basketball team represents University of North Alabama in Florence, Alabama, United States. The school's team currently competes in the ASUN Conference. On July 1, 2018, they joined the Atlantic Sun Conference. Since joining NCAA Division I, the Lions have not yet appeared in the NCAA Tournament. At the NCAA Division II level, North Alabama won the 1979 and 1991 national championship.\nPostseason.\nCBI results.\nNorth Alabama has appeared in one CBI tournament. Their record is 0–1.\nNCAA Division II results.\nNorth Alabama appeared in the NCAA Division II men's basketball tournament tournament fourteen times. Their record was 31–13.\nHistory.\nThe men's basketball program at the University of North Alabama is one of the most successful in collegiate basketball, having claimed two national championships, made five Final Four appearances and played in 14 NCAA championship tournaments.\nThe foundation for UNA's success in basketball, and its entire athletic program, was put in place by Eddie Flowers. After coming to UNA (then Florence State Teachers College) in 1929, Flowers began the school's athletic program in 1932 and coached the first basketball team that season. He remained as basketball coach until 1948 and as athletic director until 1969. When the Lions' new basketball facility was opened in 1972, it was only fitting that it be named for the founder of Lion athletics - Eddie Flowers - and was named Flowers Hall.\nEd Billingham was hired as the school's second men's basketball coach in 1948 and he directed the Lions for the next 24 years, winning 249 games. He also led the Lions to the NAIA National Tournament in 1960 and 1962.\nBill E. Jones was hired as UNA's third basketball head coach in 1972 and had a 28-17 record in two seasons. Lion basketball alumnus Bill L.\nJones was hired in 1974 and the Lion basketball fortunes went to a new level. In 14 seasons, Jones led UNA to six NCAA Tournament appearances and four trips to the Final Four, including an NCAA Division II National Championship in 1979. UNA was the first college or university in the state to win a basketball national championship and is one of just four Division II programs to have won more than one Division II basketball championship. Jones led UNA to Gulf South Conference championships in 1977, 1981 and 1984 and GSC Tournament titles in 1981, 1984 and 1988. He led UNA to NCAA Tournaments in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1984 and 1988, with his teams winning regional crowns in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1984. Under Jones, UNA went to the Final Four in 1977, 1979, 1980 and 1984. In 14 his seasons, Jones led his UNA squads to a combined 165-37 home record at Flowers Hall for an 81.7 winning percentage.\nUNA’s fourth head coach, Gary Elliott, continued the Lions' success story, taking his teams to a 252-140 record overall and a 148-49 record at home. In Elliott's 15 seasons, he led the Lions to their second national championship in 1991, four NCAA appearances in 1991, 1994, 1995, and 1996 and an average of better than 19 wins per season. The Lions have won 20 or more games five times under Elliott. Elliott, who retired at the end of the 2002-03 season, helped place UNA among the division's elite.\nBobby Champagne took over the Lions Basketball program for the 2003-04 campaign, leading the Lions to the GSC Tournament in each of Champagne’s 15 seasons at the helm of the program. On Nov. 20, 2004, the Lions knocked off top-ranked Southern Indiana 78-75 at home on its way to a 10-4 record at Flowers Hall.\nIn 2006, the Lions returned to the NCAA tournament for the first time in 10 seasons finishing with an 18-11 record. Two years later, UNA was back in the Elite Eight. The Lions went 27-9 during the 2007-08 campaign and won the South Region Tournament before falling to top-ranked Bentley at the Mass Mutual Building in Springfield, Mass. The Lions added back-to-back NCAA trips in 12-13 and 13-14, including a GSC title in 2014 with a 79-73 victory over Christian Brothers in the championship game.\nNorth Alabama began its transition to NCAA Division I status in 2018 and joined the ASUN Conference. After hiring Tony Pujol to lead the program, The Lions posted a 10-22 record during its first Division I season, earning a No. 6 seed in the ASUN Tournament with a 7-9 league record after being picked to finish last in the preseason coaches’ poll. He followed with a three-win improvement in the second year and a No. 5 seed in the conference tourney.\nEddie Flowers.\nEddie Flowers is considered the father of UNA men's basketball. After his arrival at what was then known as Florence State Teachers College in 1929, Flowers initiated the school's athletic program in 1932 and coached the first basketball team that season. Flowers served as basketball coach until 1948 and remained the athletic director until 1972. Flowers Hall, the university's basketball facility, is named after the long-serving coach and athletic administrator.\nEd Billingham.\nFlower's successor Ed Billingham coached the team for the next 24 years, winning 249 games. He also led the Lions to the NAIA National Tournament in 1960 and 1962.\nBill E. Jones.\nBill E. Jones assumed the head coaching job in 1972, posting a 28–17 record over two seasons.\nBill L. Jones.\nHired as head coach in 1974, Bill L. Jones, a Lion basketball alumnus, led UNA to six NCAA Tournament appearances and four appearances at the Final Four, including an NCAA Division II National Championship in 1979. UNA was the first Alabama college or university to win a national championship title in basketball and is only one of four Division II programs to have earned more than one Division II basketball national championships.\nUnder Jones’ leadership, the Lions secured three Gulf South Conference championships in 1977, 1981, and 1984 and three GSC Tournament Titles in 1981, 1984 and 1988. Jones led UNA to NCAA Tournaments in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1984 and 1988, with his teams winning regional crowns in 1977, 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1984.\nDuring Jones’ tenure, UNA also went to the Final Four in 1977, 1979, 1980 and 1984. During Jones’ 14-season UNA basketball coaching career, his teams amassed a 165–37 home record at Flowers Hall for an 81.7 winning percentage.\nGary Elliott.\nOver the course of his 15-season tenure at UNA, Coach Gary Elliot, secured a 252–140 overall record and a 148–49 home record. He also led the Lions to their second national championship in 1991, as well as to four NCAA appearances in 1991, 1994, 1995, and 1996.\nBobby Champagne.\nCoach Bobby Champagne, who coached his first season in 2003–04, led the Lions to a 12–16 record, followed by a 14–14 the next season. Champagne, UNA's sixth head basketball coach, led the Lions to fifteen straight Gulf South Conference tournament appearances and to the program's first NCAA Tournament since 1996.\nAfter taking over the reins in 2003, he has returned the Lion program to a position of national prominence.\nUnder Champagne, the Lions advanced to fifteen straight Gulf South Conference tournaments and four NCAA tournaments, including an NCAA Division II South Regional Championship in the 2007–08 season. He was 245–194 during his tenure at North Alabama.\nAfter finishing the 2007–08 season at 27–8 and re-writing much of the school's record book in the process, the Lions were 18–10 in 2009. Kenny Johnson was named GSC East Player of the Year. The Lions posted back-to-back 13–16 campaigns over the last two years while twice advancing to the semi-finals of the GSC Tournament.\nChampagne, who was honored by the NABC as South Region Coach of the Year in 2008, had been affiliated with 11 postseason tournament teams (nine NCAA, two NIT) during his 23-year collegiate coaching career. He came to UNA after one season as an assistant coach at the University of Texas-El Paso.\nIn his first season at UNA, Champagne led the Lions to a 12–16 record that also included a berth in the 2004 GSC tournament. The following season, the Lions improved to 14–14, and again were participants in the conference tourney.\nDuring the 2004–05 campaign, UNA knocked off several ranked teams in the regular season, including No. 1 Southern Indiana on Nov. 20 at Flowers Hall. The Lions finished the year with a 14–14 mark. In 2005–06, UNA was 18–11, played in the GSC Tournament and received an NCAA South Regional bid. The NCAA postseason nod was the first for the Lions since 1996 and the eighth for Champagne. The Lions had their second consecutive winning season in 2006–07, going 15–14.\nThe Lions advanced to the semifinals of the GSC Tournament during the 2009-10 and 2010-11 seasons. UNA w\nthen went 19-9 during the 2012-13 season and returned to the NCAA Tournament. The 2013-14 season was capped with a second straight NCAA Tournament as well as a GSC Tournament Championship. UNA advanced to the second round of the NCAA South Regional.\nChampagne's contract was not renewed in 2018 when the Lions moved to Division I.\nTony Pujol.\nTony Pujol was hired on April 2, 2018 after serving as an assistant basketball coach at Appalachian State University, Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Alabama before taking a position at Wyoming in 2016. He became just the seventh head coach in the 88-year history of the UNA’s men’s basketball program.\nPujol led North Alabama as the school began its transition to NCAA Division I basketball in the 2018-19 season as a member of the ASUN Conference. The Lions posted a 10-22 record during its first Division I season, earning a No. 6 seed in the ASUN Tournament with a 7-9 league record after being picked to finish last in the preseason coaches’ poll. He followed with a three-win improvement in the second year and a No. 5 seed in the conference tourney."

        "title": "Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball",
        "text": "The Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball program is the men's college basketball team of the University of Kentucky. It has eight NCAA championships, the best all-time winning percentage, and the most all-time victories. The Wildcats compete in the Southeastern Conference and are coached by Mark Pope.\nAdolph Rupp first brought Kentucky to national prominence, winning four NCAA titles. Since then, Joe B. Hall, Rick Pitino, Tubby Smith, and John Calipari each won a national championship, making Kentucky the only school with five coaches to win NCAA championships and placing it second only to UCLA for most titles. Kentucky has finished as the NCAA runner-up four times, making it tied with UCLA and North Carolina for all-time title game appearances at 12. The program has played in 17 NCAA Final Fours, tying Duke for third-all time behind North Carolina and UCLA. Kentucky leads all schools in several NCAA tournament stats: Elite Eight appearances at 38, Sweet Sixteen appearances at 45, total NCAA tournament appearances at 60, and tournament games played at 184. The program is behind only North Carolina with 131 NCAA tournament wins, North Carolina has 132. Kentucky has also won the National Invitation Tournament twice, making it the only school to win multiple NCAA and NIT championships, and it leads all schools in total postseason appearances at 68. Additionally, the Helms Athletic Foundation declared Kentucky the 1933 and 1954 national champions, the latter being Kentucky's only undefeated team in the modern era (post-1930). The 1948 NCAA champion team, coached by Rupp, represented the United States in the Olympics and won a gold medal.\nKentucky was the first program to 1000 wins in 1968 and the first to 2000 wins in 2009. The program leads all schools with sixty-three 20-win seasons, sixteen 30-win seasons, and six 35-win seasons. Additionally, Kentucky is second among all teams in conference regular season championships with 53.\nThroughout its history, the Kentucky basketball program has featured many notable and successful players, both on the collegiate level and the professional level. Five players have been named national player of the year, with Anthony Davis in 2012 and Oscar Tshiebwe in 2022 being consensus selections. Three players have been named national freshman of the year: John Wall in 2010, Davis in 2012, and Reed Sheppard in 2024. Thirty-nine players have been selected as All-Americans a total of 51 times. Kentucky holds the record for the most overall NBA Draft selections (128) and three Wildcats have been selected as the first overall pick (Wall, Davis, and Karl-Anthony Towns). Thirty-nine players have been honored with jersey retirements, as well as Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, equipment manager Bill Keightly, and broadcaster Cawood Ledford. Seven players have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Hall of Fame, as well as Rupp, Pitino, Calipari, Eddie Sutton, and Ledford.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1903–1930).\nDuring Kentucky's earliest seasons the program went through multiple coaches, with the majority staying only one or two seasons.\nRecords indicate that the first head coach of the Wildcats was W. W. H. Mustaine, who in 1903 called together some students, took up a collection totaling $3 for a ball, and told the students to start playing. The first recorded intercollegiate game at the college was a 15–6 defeat to nearby Georgetown College. The team went 1–2 for their first \"season\", also losing to Kentucky University (later Transylvania University) but defeating the Lexington YMCA.\nThrough 1908, the team did not manage a winning season, and had an all-time record of 15–29. In the fall of that year a full-time head coach was hired, Edwin Sweetland. This made him the first paid coach in Kentucky's basketball history. That year, the team went 5–4, and only three years later, boasted their first undefeated season with nine victories and no losses. The 1914 team under Alpha Brummage, led by brothers Karl and Tom Zerfoss, went 12–2 and defeated all its Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association opponents.\nGeorge Buchheit and the \"Wonder Team\" (1919–1925).\nIn 1919, George Buchheit became the new head coach of the Wildcats. An alumnus of the University of Illinois, he brought with him a new system of basketball. The \"Buchheit system\" or \"Illinois system\", focused on defense and featured one player standing under each basket, while three roamed the court. Bucheit varied the system he learned in Illinois in one important way. While the Illinois system employed a zone defense, Buchheit's system used an aggressive man-to-man scheme. On offense, he used a complicated system of passing called the \"zig-zag\" or \"figure eight\" offense.\nAlthough the team had a losing season in Buchheit's first year, they won the first-ever Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association tournament the next year, defeating the heavily favored Georgia Bulldogs. Both of these teams were composed entirely of native Kentuckians, anchored by All-American Basil Hayden. The tournament victory was considered Kentucky's first major success, and the 1921 team became known as the \"Wonder Team.\"\nIn 1922, the team was unable to build on the success of the \"Wonder Team.\" Although every player was eligible in 1922, two key players, Hayden and Sam Ridgeway, were injured before the start of the season. Hayden returned from his knee injury during the season, but was never able to play at the level he had the previous year. Ridgeway fought a year-long battle with diphtheria, and although he recovered, never played for the Wildcats again. The remaining three members of the \"Wonder Team\" went 9–5 for the season, and bowed out of the SIAA tournament in the second round.\nC.O Applegran, Ray Eklund, and Basil Hayden (1925–1927).\nBuchheit remained as coach through the 1924 season before moving on to coach Trinity College (later Duke University). A different coach would guide the team for each of the next four years. C.O. Applegran immediately followed Buchheit, and his 1925 team posted a respectable 13–8 record. Applegran in college had played for the University of Illinois, where he became an All-American. The next year, Ray Eklund led the team to a 15–3 record, and produced UK's second All-American, Burgess Carey. The record was enough for Kentucky to win their first regular season conference championship in the Southern Conference.\nSeeing the cupboard largely bare for the upcoming year, Eklund resigned shortly before the start of the 1927 season. The team scrambled to find a new coach, and former player Basil Hayden left his coaching job at Kentucky Wesleyan College to answer the call. An inexperienced coach and a roster largely depleted of talent left the Wildcats with a 3–13 record that year. The disappointment convinced Hayden that he wasn't the \"coaching type\", and he resigned after the season. Fortunately for the Wildcats, 1927 would be their last losing season for six decades.\nJohn Mauer and the \"Mauermen\" (1927–1930).\nThe Wildcats' new coach for the 1927–28 season was John Mauer. Although he had a talented group of players moving up from the junior varsity team, Mauer quickly discovered that his players did not know the fundamentals of the game. He began a regimen of three-hour practices five days a week during the preseason. The practice began with half an hour of shooting drills and usually ended with a full-court scrimmage. Between the two, Mauer worked on skill drills and scenarios. Mauer's teams were nicknamed the \"Mauermen.\"\nTeamwork was the hallmark of Mauer's system. Every player worked on every aspect of the game; there were no specialists. Like Buchheit, Mauer employed a strong man-to-man defense. He utilized a slow-break offense that relied on a complicated system of short passes to get a good shot. Two elements of Mauer's system were new to basketball in the south – the offensive screen and the bounce pass. The latter was so new to most of UK's opponents that it was referred to as the \"submarine attack.\"\nOver his three-year tenure, Mauer led the Wildcats to an overall record of 40–14. One major prize eluded him, however. Despite having teams that were almost universally acknowledged as the \"class of the South\", Mauer never led a team to the Southern Conference title. Despite his innate ability for coaching, Mauer lacked the ability to heighten his team's emotions for a big game, a fault that was cited as the reason for his lack of tournament success. Mauer left the Wildcats to coach the Miami University Redskins following the 1930 season.\nAdolph Rupp (1930–1972).\nIn 1930, the university hired Adolph Rupp, who had played as a reserve for the University of Kansas 1922 and 1923 Helms National Championship teams, under coach Forest C. \"Phog\" Allen. At the time of his hiring, Rupp was a high school coach in Freeport, Illinois.\nRupp coached the University of Kentucky men's basketball team from 1930 to 1972. There, he gained the nicknames, \"Baron of the Bluegrass\", and \"The Man in the Brown Suit\". Rupp, who was an early innovator of the fast break and set offense, gained a reputation as an intense competitor, a strict motivator, and strategist. Rupp's Wildcat teams won 4 NCAA championships (1948, 1949, 1951, 1958), one NIT title in 1946, appeared in 20 NCAA tournaments, had 6 NCAA Final Four appearances, captured 27 Southeastern Conference (SEC) regular season titles, and won 13 SEC tournaments. Rupp's Kentucky teams also finished ranked No. 1 on 6 occasions in the final Associated Press college basketball poll and 4 times in the United Press International (Coaches) poll. In addition, Rupp's 1966 Kentucky squad (nicknamed \"Rupp's Runts\", as no starting player on the squad was taller than 6'5\") finished runner-up in the NCAA tournament, and his 1947 Wildcats finished runner-up in the NIT. Rupp's 1933 and 1954 Kentucky squads were also awarded the Helms National Championship, and his 1934 and 1947 teams were retroactively recognized as the national champion by the Premo-Porretta Power Poll.\nThe Beardless Wonders (1944).\nRupp gave the '44 team the nickname \"the Beardless Wonders\" and \"Wildkittens\" because according to Rupp, \"It was like running a Kindergarten\". Of the young players, Kentucky's best player was freshman Chad Anderson who, at the age of 17, was named consensus All-American, making him the youngest player to ever earn the title. The Beardless Wonders won 19 of their 21 games, enough to be invited into the NIT. There they were matched up with a Utah team nicknamed the \"Blitz Kids\". Both teams went into the half tied at 24, but with the help of Brannum Kentucky pulled away to win 46–38. Kentucky lost the next game to home town Saint John's.\nKentucky's first championship (1948).\nOn the way to its first NCAA title, Kentucky went on to a record of 36–3. Of these three losses, all were either away or at neutral sites, keeping Kentucky undefeated at home throughout the entire season. Kentucky started off the beginning of the season with a 7–0 record heading into their away game at Temple. However, Temple was able to give the Cats their first loss by one point, 60–59. But the Wildcats rolled off an 11-win streak before playing at Notre Dame, where they lost 55–64. They did not lose a game for the rest of the regular season. Kentucky continued through the NCAA tournament to the finals, where they faced the Baylor Bears. Kentucky won its first NCAA title in a decisive 58–42 victory. The season did not end after the NCAA tournament, as Kentucky who would play in the Olympic Trials, where they went 2–1, only losing to the Phillips Oilers once. This was performance enough to represent the United States in the 1948 Olympic Games. Despite only being a college team, the starting 5 of Kentucky defeated all of its competition in London, making Kentucky the only team to win both an NCAA title and an Olympic gold medal. Adolph Rupp soon gave this team the nickname \"The Fabulous Five\", in honor of their accomplishments.\nBack-to-back championships (1949).\nFor the 1949 season Kentucky had high expectations with most of the Fabulous Five returning. Big Blue Nation's expectations were met as the 1949 team won one more game than the previous year including both a SEC regular season and SEC tournament championship, while also getting back to the Final Four that March. In the finals Kentucky faced the Oklahoma A&amp;M Cowboys, a team that had previously seen success in the tournament with back-to-back championships in 1945 and 1946. The Fab Five would succeed again winning 46–36 and Kentucky's only back-to-back NCAA championship. Kentucky was the second program in NCAA history to win back-to-back championships (there have been six other schools since).\nA new decade (1950).\nWith a returning star player like Bill Spivey, Kentucky hoped to carry their success into the new decade. The Wildcats lost their first game by 11 to Saint John's at home, but they would pull it together for the Sugar Bowl Tournament, which they won, beating NCAA runner-up Bradley. After losing to Tennessee, Kentucky struggled to chain two wins together, losing every other game. They defeated their next 14 opponents, including getting revenge in SEC tournament championship over Tennessee. Heading into the post-season, No. 3 Kentucky played CCNY in the NIT, missing the NCAA tournament. The Wildcats were no match and were thrashed by the CCNY Beavers, 50–83.\nThird championship and point-shaving scandal (1951).\nOver the season Kentucky defeated four top 10 teams, and were ranked in the top 5 the entire season. Vanderbilt, however, knocked off the top ranked Wildcats in the SEC tournament finals denying them an eighth straight SEC tournament title. Kentucky then defeated fourth ranked Kansas State 68–58 in the NCAA finals, .\nAdolph Rupp was the head coach at Kentucky during the year of the point-shaving scandal of 1951. In 1945 former Kentucky football player Nick Englisis met Kentucky player Ralph Beard while the two played football at Kentucky. Englisis entered the gambling business when he left the football team in 1946, then approached three Kentucky basketball players Ralph Beard, Alex Groza, and Dale Barnstable with his associates in late 1948 about potentially point shaving (fixing the score of games) during the upcoming season in exchange for money. The three players agreed to point shave and successfully shaved points in several games during the 1948–1949 season until an effort to point shave caused the Wildcats to lose to the Loyola Ramblers in the National Invitation Tournament. Groza, Beard, and Barnstable attempted to win the game under the point spread but kept the score too close, allowing the Ramblers to win the game with an impressive performance at the end of the second half. Kentucky faced Villanova in their first game of the NCAA tournament following the loss to Loyola and the three players attempted to win over the point spread. When Groza, Beard, and Barnstable failed to win over the point spread, it caused Englisis to lose all of his money and ended the point shaving deals between Englisis and these three players. On October 20, 1951, Alex Groza, Ralph Beard, and Dale Barnstable were arrested for taking bribes from gamblers to shave points during several games including the National Invitation Tournament game against the Loyola Ramblers in the 1948–49 season.\nAt the conclusion of this scandal, a subsequent NCAA investigation found that Kentucky had committed several rule violations, including giving illegal spending money to players on several occasions, and also allowing some ineligible athletes to compete. As a result, the Southeastern Conference voted to ban Kentucky from competing for a year and the NCAA requested all other basketball-playing members not to schedule Kentucky, with eventually none doing so. As a result of these actions, Kentucky was forced to cancel the entire 1952–53 basketball season. Years later, Walter Byers, the first executive director of the NCAA, unofficially referred to this punishment as the first de facto NCAA death penalty, despite the current rule first coming into effect in 1985, thus the NCAA having no such enforcement power previous to that. Echoing Mr. Byers' view, the NCAA's official stance is very much the same, and they now state in hindsight, \"In effect, it was the Association's first death penalty, though its enforcement was binding only through constitutional language that required members to compete against only those schools that were compliant with NCAA rules. Despite fears that it would resist, Kentucky accepts the penalty and, in turn, gives the NCAA credibility to enforce its rules.\"\nUndefeated but no tournament (1954).\nThe team posted a perfect 25–0 record in the next year (Rupp's only undefeated season), for which it was awarded the 1954 Helms National Championship. In addition, Kentucky also finished ranked No. 1 in the final Associated Press poll. On the team were three players who had graduated at the conclusion of the previous academic year. When, at the last minute, the NCAA ruled these players ineligible from post-season play, Rupp decided to skip the 1954 NCAA Tournament in protest.\nRupp's fourth championship (1958).\nThe \"Fiddlin' Five\" team earned their name though playing around and mistakes, which Rupp described as fiddling. The Fiddlin' Five still has the most losses out of any Kentucky's championships, with six, three of those were in four games. Unlike the Fab Five or the 1951 teams, the Fiddling Five would yoyo in the rankings with their lowest a No. 13 coming after 56–57 loss to unranked Loyola Chicago. Kentucky improved through the tournament though, and won their fourth title over No. 18 Seattle in the confines of Louisville's Freedom Hall.\nRupp's Runts (1966).\nRupp's last Final Four team and one of his last chances at a 5th NCAA title occurred in the 1965–66 season, with Kentucky going all the way to the NCAA title game. The 1966 NCAA championship game against Texas Western (now University of Texas-El Paso or UTEP) marked the first occurrence that an all-white starting five (Kentucky) played an all-black starting five (Texas Western) in the NCAA championship game. Texas Western won the game 72–65, on the night of March 19, 1966. Kentucky entered the tournament with only one loss and ranked No. 1, Texas Western also had only one loss and entered the tournament ranked second. Kentucky was a 6.5 point favorite in the game The game was depicted in the film \"Glory Road\".\nThis game, and the result of it, were especially significant as the game came at a time when the civil rights movement was coming into full swing around the country. In 1969, after actively recruiting black players for over six years (his first formal scholarship offer was to Wes Unseld in 1964), despite most of the other SEC teams threatening to boycott if a black player took the court), Rupp finally signed his first black player, Tom Payne, an athletic 7'-1\" center out of Louisville. This ended the aspect of all-white Kentucky teams forever, and marked a new era with many notable black Kentucky basketball legends, including Jack Givens, Sam Bowie, Kenny Walker, Jamal Mashburn, Tayshaun Prince, Rajon Rondo, John Wall, Anthony Davis, and Karl Anthony Towns.\nThe late Rupp years (1967–1972).\nThe late Rupp years looked promising with Dan Issel's commitment to the Wildcats in 1966. Over the next four years Issel scored an average of 25.7 per game, adding up to 2,137 points in his college career. This made Issel the player with the most points to ever play at Kentucky, a feat that has not been matched to this day. This included his 53 points scored against Mississippi State in 1970, the most by a Kentucky player in a single game until Jodie Meeks made 54 against rival Tennessee on January 13, 2009. Issel did not capture the national championship in his college years, but would go on to make a name for himself in the ABA.\nAfter 1966 Rupp saw continued success, but the Final Four eluded him. The Wildcats ended with a 13–13 season and missed the tournament altogether in 1967, then reach the Elite Eight and Sweet Sixteen in the next two years. Ranked #1 in the nation with a 26–1 record overall, Kentucky nearly missed a Final Four berth in a 106–100 shootout against Jacksonville. \nRupp was forced into retirement in March 1972, after reaching age 70. At the time, this was the mandatory retirement age for all University of Kentucky employees. He was a 5-time National Coach-of-the-Year award winner, a 7-time Conference Coach-of-the-Year award winner, and was elected a member of both the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and College Basketball Hall of Fame. Further, since 1972, the Adolph Rupp Trophy, considered one of the nation's premier basketball awards, has been given by Commonwealth Athletic Club to the nation's top men's college basketball player. In addition, the University of Kentucky retired a jersey in his honor in the rafters of Rupp Arena, a 23,500-seat arena named after him, dedicated in 1976.\nJoe B. Hall (1972–1985).\nJoe B. Hall was the head basketball coach at Kentucky from 1972 to 1985. Although he had been an assistant at Kentucky since 1965, Coach Hall was given a difficult task: to follow in the footsteps of his predecessor, Adolph Rupp. In the 1978 NCAA tournament, he coached the Wildcats to their fifth NCAA championship. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and SEC Coach of the Year on four occasions. His record at UK was 297–100, and 373–156 over his career.\nCoach Hall won the title once in 1978, as well as making the final four in 1975 and 1984, and the elite eight in 1972, 1973, 1977, 1983.\nCoach Hall is one of only three men to both play on an NCAA championship team (1949– Kentucky) and coach an NCAA championship team (1978– Kentucky), and the only one to do so for the same school. The only others to achieve this feat are:\nThe Super Kittens (1975).\nAfter a year of playing in the freshman league and a disappointing sophomore season, Hall's Super Kittens returned with hopes of finally bringing Kentucky its fifth title. They nearly did just that, guiding Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the 1975 NCAA tournament but not before avenging their 20-point defeat to an undefeated Indiana team. Despite losing in the championship game, it would give freshman Jack Givens a taste for success that would help propel Kentucky to the title three years later.\nThe Season Without Celebration and fifth championship (1978).\nIt had been 20 years without a championship in Lexington, and along with pressure of following a hall of fame coach, Hall would nickname the 1978 season the \"Season Without Celebration.\" The pressure to win was immense on both players and coach to bring home the title, especially with a senior laden team that had gone to the finals as freshmen. Kentucky would hardly lose its composure all season or break under pressure, winning 30 of 32 games and defeating eight ranked teams along the way. By the time Kentucky reached the tournament finals they seemed bound to win the title, though Duke would give Kentucky their all. With the help of senior Jack \"Goose\" Givens' 41 points, Kentucky defeated the Blue Devils 94–88, and finally won their fifth title and first in 20 years.\nEddie Sutton (1985–1989).\nEarly Sutton era (1985–1988).\nIn 1985, Eddie Sutton succeeded Joe B. Hall. He coached the Wildcats for four years, leading them to the Elite Eight of the 1986 NCAA tournament. Two seasons later, Sutton and the 25–5 Wildcats captured their 37th SEC title and were ranked as the 6th college basketball team in the nation by the Associated Press and UPI before losing to Villanova in the Tournament.\nEmery scandal (1989).\nKentucky entered the 1988–89 season with a gutted roster. Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett had all graduated from school, while All-SEC sophomore Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA draft. Additionally, sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspected of cheating on his college entrance exam and voluntarily agreed to sit out until the investigation was finished. Potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp transferred out of Kentucky after signing with the school early that year. Unfortunately, Manuel was forced to sit out the entire season as the investigation dragged on, essentially leaving the Wildcats in the hands of inexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and true freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and the Wildcats finished with a losing record of 13–19, the team's first losing full-season record since 1927. To add insult to injury, the NCAA announced at the end of the season that its investigation into the basketball program had found the school guilty of violating numerous NCAA policies.\nThe scandal broke when Emery Worldwide employees claimed to have discovered $1,000 in cash in an envelope Kentucky assistant coach Dwane Casey sent to Mills' father. Later Emery settled a libel lawsuit filed by Casey for a substantial amount of money. Casey was not in Lexington when the envelope was supposedly mailed and the father of Mills said they received no money. The NCAA rescinded its show cause order immediately after the settlement of the lawsuit, and Casey's career has flourished as an NBA coach. Another player, Eric Manuel, was alleged to have received improper assistance on his college entrance exams and was banned from NCAA competition. Whether Manuel was directly involved has been questioned. Kentucky was already on probation stemming from allegations of an extensive scheme of payments to recruits, and the NCAA seriously considered hitting the Wildcats with the \"death penalty\", which would have shut down the entire basketball program (as opposed to simply being banned from postseason play) for up to two years. However, school president David Roselle forced Sutton and athletic director Cliff Hagan to resign. The Wildcats were slapped with three years' probation, a two-year ban from postseason play, the vacating of their two NCAA tournament wins in the 1988 season, and a ban from live television in 1989–90.\nRick Pitino (1989–1997).\nPost season ban and rebuilding with the Unforgettables (1989–1992).\nIn 1989, Rick Pitino left the NBA's New York Knicks and became the coach at a Kentucky program reeling from the aforementioned scandal. Kentucky would be banned from the 1990 and 1991 post season, with the 1990 season suffering a 14–14 record. Kentucky would improve in 1991 with a beavy of home-grown upperclassmen such as Sean Woods, John Pelphrey, Richie Farmer, Deron Feldhaus, and Reggie Hanson along with the talented freshman Jamal Mashburn. Despite their record of 22–6, Kentucky was still banned from the post season and would have to wait another year to see the Unforgettables succeed in the tournament.\nBeginning with the 1992 season, Kentucky was free of post season bans. Though they lost one more game than last season, this team was most memorable for going to the Elite Eight (for the first time since Sutton's 1986 team) with many returning upperclassmen from Kentucky. The team is also known for playing in what could be considered one of the greatest games in NCAA tournament history against Duke. In this game defending champion Duke were looking to return to the Final Four once again, Kentucky for the first time in almost a decade. The game was hard-fought and physical on both sides all game including Laettner's infamous stomp on Aminu Timberlake, which resulted in a technical. The teams took the lead back and forth until the final minute of the game which resulted in a first buzzer beater shot by Kentucky's Sean Woods to take the lead 103–102, and then Laettner's shot to win the game for the Blue Devils in the final seconds 104–103. This team came to be known as the \"Unforgettables\" for helping put Kentucky back on the path to success in the 1990s and because the team was made up of home grown Kentucky kids.\nReturn to the Final Four (1993).\nKentucky returned a junior Mashburn, along with Travis Ford and Tony Delk. They were expected to reach the Final Four for the first time since Joe B. Hall's 1984 team. The expectations were right, as Kentucky would head into the post-season with only 2 losses and a No. 5 ranking. After winning the SEC Tournament once again, Kentucky stormed to the NCAA Final Four to meet up with Michigan's \"Fab Five\" a team of young and highly talented recruits that brought Michigan to the championship game the year before. As talented as Kentucky was they would fail to reach the championship game with a 78–81 overtime loss to the Wolverines. But this would be the just a glimpse of a run Kentucky would have later in the decade.\nThe Mardi Gras Miracle (1994).\nKentucky started the next season ranked #1 but would underachieve, falling short of the Elite Eight for the only time under Pitino. The highlight of the season was the \"Mardi Gras Miracle\", a game where Kentucky trailed LSU 68–37 with 15:34 left, but outscored them 62–27 over the remainder of regulation to win 99–95.\nThe Untouchables and championship number six (1996).\nStarting in 1996, Kentucky would put together a string of Final Fours with help from 9 future NBA players. The \"Untouchables\" as they were nicknamed, would only lose twice, to Final Four bound UMass Minutemen (coached by former Kentucky coach John Calipari) and Mississippi State. It was with their overwhelming talent and chemistry that would win Kentucky their sixth national title in the 1996 NCAA tournament, Kentucky's first NCAA championship in 18 years.\nThe Unbelievables (1997).\nThe following year, Pitino's Kentucky team made it back to the national title game, losing to Arizona in overtime in the finals of the 1997 NCAA tournament. Pitino's fast-paced teams at Kentucky were favorites of the school's fans. It was primarily at Kentucky where he implemented his signature style of full-court pressure defense. By the end of the Pitino era, Kentucky went from banned from the post season to going to three of the last five Final Fours and five of the last six Elite Eights. For this the 1997 team was dubbed the \"Unbelievables\" for taking a team that was not expected much of to return the Wildcats back to the championship game for a second time.\nPitino left Kentucky in 1997 to coach the NBA's Boston Celtics, he then went on to coach Kentucky's in-state rival, the University of Louisville.\nOrlando \"Tubby\" Smith (1997–2007).\nOrlando \"Tubby\" Smith was introduced by UK Athletic Director C.M. Newton as the Wildcats' 20th head coach on May 12, 1997, charged with the unenviable task of replacing popular coach Rick Pitino. The Wildcats were at the top of the basketball world at the time, having won a national title in 1996 and, according to many, missing a second straight title in 1997 by the torn ACL of shooting guard Derek Anderson. (Anderson tore his ACL in January against SEC foe Auburn; Kentucky lost the 1997 title game in overtime to the Arizona Wildcats.) The team Smith inherited sported seven players from the Arizona loss, and five from the 1996 championship team. However, since most of the players who had left after the 1996 and 1997 seasons were high NBA draft picks, his team had the lowest pre-season ranking since Kentucky came off probation in 1991.\nNew coach and a seventh championship (1998).\nIn his first season at UK, he coached the Wildcats to their seventh NCAA championship, including a come-from-behind victory against Duke in the Elite Eight, and another comeback win against Stanford, then Utah in the Finals. His 1998 National Championship is unique in modern times, as being along with 1985 Villanova the 2nd team in over 20 years to win without a First Team All American or future NBA Lottery Pick (see 1998 NCAA tournament). The 1998 team was also unlike Kentucky's past two championship teams, often falling behind in games before roaring back to win rather than dominating their competition.\nSmith's teams, known primarily for a ball line defense-oriented slower style of play coined \"Tubbyball\", received mixed reviews among Kentucky fans who have historically enjoyed a faster, higher-scoring style of play under previous coaches. Smith was also under pressure from Kentucky fans to recruit better players.\nFinal Four drought (1999–2007).\nAfter leading Kentucky to one National Championship in 1998, Kentucky would complete a perfect 16–0 regular season conference record in 2003, win five SEC regular season championships (1998, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2005) and five SEC Tournament titles (1998, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2004). Smith led the Wildcats to six Sweet Sixteen appearances (1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005) and four Elite Eight appearances (1998, 1999, 2003, 2005) in his ten seasons. He totaled 100 wins quicker than any other Wildcat coach before him except Hall of Famer Adolph Rupp, reaching the plateau in 130 games (John Calipari subsequently broke this record in 114 games). In 2003, he was named AP College Coach of the Year.\nIn 1998, the reserve guard J.P. Blevins scored 9 points, all on 3-pointers sparking the Wildcats to come back from a 15-point deficit in the first half to upset the number 5 seed, Michigan State 60–58. Averaging only 2.2 points a game all season, Blevins was the unlikely hero for the Wildcats who were 6–4, to give the Spartans who were 8-3 an unlikely upset. Especially since they fell behind 26–11 in the first half.\nAlthough Smith compiled an impressive resume during his UK career, he came under considerable pressure from many UK fans, who believed that his failure to achieve even a single Final Four appearance in his last nine seasons was inadequate by UK standards. He was infamously dubbed \"Ten Loss Tubby\" by several disgruntled UK fans. Smith's Final Four drought is the longest of any coach in UK history, although Smith did come just a double-overtime loss short of another Final Four appearance in 2005. On March 22, 2007, Smith resigned his position of UK Head Coach to accept the head coach position at the University of Minnesota.\nBilly Gillispie (2007–2009).\nOn April 6, 2007, Billy Gillispie was formally announced as the new head coach of the University of Kentucky by UK athletic director Mitch Barnhart. He fielded questions from the media during the press conference held at UK's new practice facility, the Joe Craft Center. He expressed his excitement and joy to be not only considered for the position but to have been given the honor and the opportunity to coach what former UK coach Rick Pitino referred to as the \"Roman Empire\" of college basketball. \"I'm very, very grateful and honored to be here, but we have a lot of work to do.\" Gillispie became only the sixth head coach in the last 76 years at the school.\nDecline in form (2008–2009).\nGillispie's second season again started out rocky in 2008 as the 'Cats fell to Virginia Military Institute in their season opener. The second game of the season saw the Wildcats fall to North Carolina by 19 points. UK rebounded to win 11 of their next 12 games, improving their record to 11–3. On January 4, the Wildcats lost a heart breaker to archrival Louisville 74–71 after a 25 ft. shot by Edgar Sosa with 2.3 seconds remaining in the game. Prior to the shot, UK was down 7 with 38.5 seconds left, and Jodie Meeks was fouled shooting a three, proceeded to make all three free throw shots, Patrick Patterson stole an inbound and passed it to Meeks who laid it in to bring the game to 71–69 with 29.6 left, and then an inbound pass went long and Meeks snatched the pass, drove to the hoop and was fouled, and then made both free throws to tie the game at 71 with 22.9 left. So all in all, UK and Meeks got seven points in about 15 seconds to tie the game. Kentucky disposed of Vanderbilt to win their SEC opener on January 10, 70–60. On January 13, in a road game against Tennessee, Jodie Meeks set a new Kentucky scoring record by dropping 54 points on the Volunteers. This total bested Dan Issel's 39-year-old scoring record by 1 point, and propelled UK to a 90–72 win and 2–0 start in conference play. Kentucky followed up this effort with a 68–45 victory at Georgia, improving to 14–4 on the season. With wins over Auburn and Alabama, Kentucky moved to 5–0 in the SEC. On January 26, UK was ranked in the AP Poll (24th) for the first time since week 1 of the 2007–08 season. UK promptly dropped 3 in a row (to Ole Miss, South Carolina, and Mississippi State) before rebounding at home with a thrilling 68–65 win over Florida. Jodie Meeks scored 23 points in the contest, including the fade-away contested 3-point basket with less than 5 seconds remaining to seal the win for UK. On Valentine's Day Kentucky handily defeated Arkansas at Bud Walton Arena 79–63 behind another strong performance from Meeks. Meeks contributed 45 points and helped UK win despite the absence of Patrick Patterson (sprained ankle). With the win, UK remained tied with South Carolina and Tennessee for 1st in the SEC East at 7–3. Following the win UK completely collapsed, losing 5 of its last 6 games to finish the regular season 19–12 with an 8–8 SEC record. Entering the SEC tournament many felt UK would need to win the championship game to get into the NCAA tournament, but UK was defeated in the second game vs. LSU. With an unimpressive regular season and quick elimination in the SEC tournament, UK did indeed miss the NCAA tournament for the first time in 18 years and instead received an invitation to the NIT tournament where the team was defeated in the quarterfinal round against Notre Dame.\nOn March 27, 2009, an 18-minute-long meeting occurred between Billy Gillispie, President Dr. Lee Todd, Jr. and Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart, after which it was announced that Gillispie would not be returning as the head coach the next season. Barnhart stressed the firing was due to more than wins and losses, citing \"philosophical differences\" and \"a clear gap in how the rules and responsibilities overseeing the program are viewed\".\nJohn Calipari (2009–2024).\nCalipari's first class (2010).\nOn April 1, 2009, John Calipari replaced former head coach Billy Gillispie as the Wildcats head coach. To begin his tenure at the University of Kentucky, John Calipari signed one of the best all time recruiting classes. The class was headlined by four five-star recruits: John Wall, DeMarcus Cousins, Daniel Orton, and Eric Bledsoe. On December 19, 2009, the Wildcats defeated Austin Peay 90–69 extending their record to 11–0, and John Calipari broke Adolph Rupp's record for the most consecutive wins to start a season for a first-year head coach at Kentucky. Kentucky defeated the Drexel Dragons 88–44 on December 21, 2009, to become the first program in college basketball history to claim their 2000th victory. By January 25, 2010, Coach \"Cal\" had the Kentucky Wildcats ranked No. 1 in both the ESPN/Coaches poll and AP poll with a record of 19–0. Calipari helped raise in excess of $1.5 million to aid the country of Haiti during the aftermath of the 2010 Haiti earthquake. President Barack Obama called the Wildcats to thank them for their relief efforts and wish them luck in their future endeavors. To finish off the 2009–10 regular season, Kentucky won its 44th SEC regular season championship (with a final 14–2 SEC record), and won its 26th SEC tournament championship, beating Mississippi State in the finals. The Wildcats then received a No. 1 seed (their 10th No. 1 seed in history) in the East Regional of the NCAA tournament, where they eventually lost to West Virginia in the Elite Eight. This also marked Kentucky's record 50th NCAA Tournament appearance.\nRun to the Final Four (2011).\nIn 2011 the Wildcats got off to a good start in the regular season with a record of 12–2, with their only losses being North Carolina away and UConn in the Maui Invitational Finals. Conference play was a different matter, and Kentucky would struggle in the SEC losing 6 out of their 8 away games, all of one were against unranked opponents. To close out the season with a three-game defeat No. 13 Florida, No. 23 Vanderbilt and Tennessee at home for a 22–8 record. The hot streak would continue and Kentucky would win their 27th SEC Tournament Title. This was enough for No. 4 seed on the East regional where they played Princeton in a very close first-round game that ended in a 59–57 victory for the Cats. Knight, Jones and company would exact their revenge in the second round against West Virginia, who knocked off Kentucky in the 2010 tourney. In the Sweet Sixteen and Elite Eight they would upset the No. 1 seed Ohio State Buckeyes and No. 2 seed North Carolina Tar Heels on their way to the school's 14th Final Four. They lost in the Final Four to eventual National Champion No. 3 seed UConn 56–55.\nThe road to an eighth championship (2012).\nIn the 2011–12 season, Calipari led Kentucky to being 16–0 in SEC regular season play, clinching its 45th SEC regular season championship. The last team to do so in the SEC was the 2002–03 Kentucky Wildcats, and before that, the 1995–96 Kentucky Wildcats. Kentucky's regular season record was 30–1, with its only loss being by one point coming from a 3-pointer buzzer-beater by the Indiana Hoosiers' Christian Watford at Assembly Hall on December 10, 2011. In the SEC Tournament, Kentucky fell to Vanderbilt in the championship game, making its overall record 32–2 going into the NCAA tournament. Kentucky was both selected as the No. 1 seed in the South Region and also the No. 1 seed overall of the entire NCAA Tournament. The Sweet 16 match-up on March 23, 2012, was a rematch against Indiana, in which this time the Wildcats prevailed over the Hoosiers 102–90. On March 25, 2012, Kentucky won the South Regional, setting up a Final Four semifinal with the Louisville Cardinals. Calipari's Wildcats defeated the Cardinals (coached by former Kentucky coach Rick Pitino) by a score of 69–61. This sent Kentucky to the National Championship game against the Kansas Jayhawks, where they defeated Kansas 67–59, winning UK's 8th NCAA championship, along with John Calipari's first NCAA Championship as a head coach. This Kentucky team had a record six players drafted in the 2012 NBA draft, including the first time two teammates have been chosen with the first two picks: Anthony Davis (1st overall), Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (2nd), Terrence Jones (18th), Marquis Teague (29th), Doron Lamb (42nd) and Darius Miller (46th).\nStarting anew (2013).\nThe 2012–13 season's recruiting class ranked either first or second by various recruiting experts led by top center Nerlens Noel, guard Archie Goodwin, forward Alex Poythress, and four-star center Willie Cauley-Stein. Kentucky also brought in transfer guard Julius Mays, a graduate student who had previously played at Wright State University and North Carolina State. Mays was eligible to play immediately, because UK offered a master's degree program that Wright State did not. However, the only returner that saw significant minutes from the championship squad was back-up power forward Kyle Wiltjer, who averaged 11 minutes per game (Ryan Harrow sat out the previous season after transferring from NC State before the 2011–12 season). Although the team saw the rise of Jarrod Polson in the first game of the season against Maryland, they struggled to close out closer games and play with the will to win that Calipari demands. On February 12, Noel tore his ACL in a loss against Florida. UK was 17–7 including that game, and went 4–5 the remainder of the season, losing all 5 games away from Rupp Arena. The fourth of those losses was against Vanderbilt in the first round of the SEC tournament, and UK missed the NCAA tournament altogether, being the overall No. 1 seed of the NIT. UK was upset by Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT, ending their season with a 21–12 record.\nIn the press conference following the loss to Robert Morris, Calipari stated that his 2013–14 team would be a \"tough, hard-nosed, fighting team.\" Noel and Goodwin both entered the NBA draft and were both taken in the first round at 6th and 29th, respectively. Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State to be closer to his father that had suffered from a stroke, and Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga. Kentucky brought in the No. 1 recruiting class, featuring a record six McDonald's All-Americans in Julius Randle, Andrew Harrison, Aaron Harrison, James Young, Dakari Johnson, and Marcus Lee, as well as Kentucky natives Derek Willis and Dominique Hawkins, and walk-on E. J. Floreal (son of Edrick Floréal, head coach of UK's track and field team). Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein did not declare for the 2013 NBA draft, and decided to return for their sophomore seasons.\nThe Tweakables (2014).\nIn 2013–14, Kentucky looked to make up for its struggles in the previous season. Despite making the NIT, there were high expectations for this team. The team, however, would be without some of its top players from the 2012–13 team including Nerlens Noel and starting shooting guard Archie Goodwin, who were first-round draft choices in the 2013 NBA draft. Starting power forward Kyle Wiltjer transferred to Gonzaga and starting point guard Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State. Returning was former McDonald's All-American Alex Poythress and starting center Willie Cauley-Stein. The poor success of the 2012–13 team did not stop John Calipari from again producing another number one recruiting class. The entering class included a record six McDonald's All-Americans highlighted by Julius Randle and the Harrison Twins from Texas, Aaron and Andrew. Many recruiting analysts and experts proclaimed that the 2013 signing class was the greatest recruiting class since the infamous Fab Five in the 1990s.\nThe team began the season ranked number one in both the AP and Coaches polls. The season was full of ups and downs. Early in the season the team experienced close losses to Baylor, Michigan State, and North Carolina. Despite those losses the team was able to defeat in-state rival Louisville. Nothing changed in SEC play for them either. The team ended the regular season losing three of their last four games including once to South Carolina, who finished the season 14–20 overall. The team limped into the SEC tournament unranked, and desperately looking for any answer to their disappointing season. Calipari during his weekly radio call-in show mentioned the team was given a \"tweak\". The \"tweak\" sparked speculation and curiosity among the fans and the media to what it could be. The \"tweak\" was never fully revealed. However, the \"tweak\" caused the team to go on an historic run through both the SEC and NCAA tournaments. UK was the runner-up to number one Florida in the SEC Tournament. During the NCAA tournament UK became the first team in history to eliminate three teams from the previous Final Four (Wichita State, Louisville, Michigan). UK was the National Runner-up after losing to Connecticut in the national championship game.\nPursuit of perfection (2015).\nAfter the 2014 season, Kentucky only lost Julius Randle and James Young to the NBA draft. The returning players consisted of a record-tying nine McDonald's All-Americans. Juniors Cauley-Stein and Poythress returned with sophomores Aaron and Andrew Harrison, Johnson, and Lee to join the No. 2 ranked 2015 recruiting class which was highlighted of Gatorade Player of the Year Karl-Anthony Towns for the 2015 season. The team began its season in the Bahamas on a six-game tour against international clubs and teams. While in the Bahamas the team established a \"platoon system\" which featured two groups of five players that would rotate every four minutes within the game. The \"platoon system\" was put on display nationally in a 72–40 victory over No. 5 Kansas in the Champions Classic in November. In December, the team defeated UCLA 83–44. Kentucky led 41–7 at halftime, the lowest UCLA point total for a half in its storied history. The SEC regular season began with two overtime victories over Ole Miss and Texas A&amp;M, the closest games Kentucky would play all season. Kentucky finished the regular season with a perfect 31–0 record, the best start in school history. In the SEC tournament, the team won each game by double digits, including a 78–63 victory over Arkansas in the finals. Cauley-Stein was named the MVP of the Tournament. In the NCAA tournament Kentucky played its first two games at the KFC Yum! Center in Louisville. Prior to the regional semifinal against West Virginia, Mountaineers guard Daxter Miles proclaimed that Kentucky would be 36–1 after the game. The comment fueled the team as they defeated West Virginia 78–39, tying the largest margin of victory in the Sweet 16 in NCAA Tournament history. In the regional final Kentucky narrowly defeated Notre Dame 68–66. The only loss of the season was in the Final Four to Wisconsin, who Kentucky defeated the previous season in the Final Four. The 2014–15 team tied the NCAA record for most wins in a season (38). After the season Cauley-Stein and Towns were named consensus All-Americans among other awards received.\nThe Kentucky Wildcats went on for a regular not out of the ordinary season with Calipari, with just over 29,000 students chearing for them in the student section.\n2023.\nThe Kentucky Wildcats represented USA Basketball, at Globl Jam 2023, and defeated Canada to win the gold medal.\nMark Pope (2024–present).\nOn April 12, 2024, Kentucky hired BYU head coach Mark Pope for the same position in Lexington, days after Calipari left for the vacant head coaching post at Arkansas\n. Pope was a member of the Wildcats' 1995-1996 team that won the NCAA Tournament.\nCoaches.\nThe Wildcats have had 22 coaches in their 112-year history. Mark Pope is the current head coach. Six Wildcats coaches have won the National Coach-of-the-Year award: Adolph Rupp in 1950, 1954, 1959, 1966, and 1970, Joe B. Hall in 1978, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990 and 1992, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, and John Calipari in 2012 and 2015. Additionally, seven Wildcats coaches have been named Southeastern Conference Coach-of-the-Year: Adolph Rupp in 1964, 1966, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972, Joe B. Hall in 1973, 1975, 1978 and 1983, Eddie Sutton in 1986, Rick Pitino in 1990, 1991 and 1996, Tubby Smith in 1998, 2003, and 2005, Billy Gillispie in 2008, and John Calipari in 2010, 2012, and 2015.\nPostseason results.\nNational championships.\nThe following is a list of Kentucky's 8 National Championships:\nNCAA Tournament seeding history.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nThe \"*\" represents overall number one seed which began with the 2004 Tournament.\nHonorees.\nKentucky has 42 men's basketball players, coaches, and contributors honored in Rupp Arena with banners representing their numbers hung from the rafters. Due to the number of players honored, the fact that several of them have shared numbers, the numbers are not officially retired. Some of the jersey numbers were before the NCAA rule change before the 1957–58 season that outlawed teams wearing jerseys with a number higher than 5 on it that was not changed until 2023. To have a banner hung, the individual must be elected to the UK Athletics Hall of Fame.\nAwards.\nNaismith Hall of Fame Members.\nThe following Kentucky players, coaches, and contributors have been enshrined in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. \nOlympians.\nThe following Kentucky players and coaches have represented their country in basketball in the Summer Olympic Games:\nFacilities.\nRupp Arena (1976–present).\nThe Kentucky Wildcats presently play their home games in 20,545-seat Rupp Arena. When it opened in 1976, it was the largest arena in the United States built specifically for basketball, and retained that status for much of the following 40-plus years. It was opened in 1976 and is named after legendary Kentucky head coach Adolph Rupp. Located off-campus, in downtown Lexington, the facility's official capacity was 23,500+ until a renovation project in the 2019 offseason reduced the capacity to 20,545. The Wildcats have consistently led the country in home attendance since the 1976–77 season (when Rupp Arena first opened), winning the National Attendance Title a record 25 times, including 17 of the past 20 seasons, and 8 of the last 10 seasons. Kentucky also has an impressive 529–64 (.892) all-time record in Rupp Arena.\nJoe Craft Center (2007–present).\nIn 2007, the university unveiled the Joe Craft Center, a state-of-the-art basketball practice facility and athletics office building attached to the north side of Memorial Coliseum on the \"Avenue of Champions\" at the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky. The 102,000 ft2 structure contains separate practice courts for the men's and women's basketball programs, separate men's and women's locker rooms, state-of-the-art video rooms for game film viewing, new coaches offices, a ticket office, and athletic administration offices.\nAs a result, Memorial Coliseum has more ample space for volleyball and gymnastics practice and games. The facility is named after businessman and philanthropist Joe Craft, a Hazard, Kentucky native, who pledged $6 million towards the completion of the $30 million project.\nMemorial Coliseum (1950–76).\nComing off back-to-back national championships, the team moved to Memorial Coliseum in 1950. Nicknamed \"The House That Rupp Built\", the multipurpose facility cost $4 million and seated 12,000 people. It also housed a swimming pool, physical education equipment, and offices for the athletics staff. The team occupied Memorial Coliseum for twenty-six seasons, and sold out all 345 home games they played there during that period. Kentucky also played a 2009 NIT game at Memorial Coliseum due to Rupp Arena being booked. The Wildcats are 307–38 (.890) all-time at Memorial Coliseum. Today, Memorial Coliseum is home to three UK women's teams—basketball, gymnastics, and volleyball.\nAlumni Gymnasium (1924–50).\nIn 1924, Alumni Gymnasium was completed. It included seating for 2,800 people and cost $92,000 to construct. Kentucky played 271 games at Alumni Gymnasium from 1924 to 1950, going 247–24 (.911). After a major renovation completed in 2018, it is now a student recreation facility known as Alumni Gym Fitness Center.\nWoodland Park Auditorium (1914–16).\nWoodland Park Auditorium, opened in 1906 and closed in 1941, was located on the corner of East High Street and Kentucky Avenue in Lexington, Kentucky. Kentucky used this facility for home games during World War I between 1914 and 1916 going 15–7 there all-time.\nBuell Armory Gymnasium (1910–24).\nThe Wildcats played 84 home games at Buell Armory Gymnasium from 1910 to 1924. It was named for Union Civil War General Don Carlos Buell who was a member of the first board of trustees at Kentucky. The armory was also used during World War I to teach truck maintenance and repair among other skills. Kentucky was 59–25 all-time at Buell Armory Gymnasium.\nState College Gymnasium (1902–14).\nThe first home court for the Wildcats was simply called \"The Gymnasium\" or State College Gymnasium until 1910. It was located in the north wing of Barker Hall on the university campus. Constructed in 1902, it also housed the university's physical education classes until 1909. The facility had a capacity of 650 people, and with no bleachers or seats, fans had to stand to watch the games that were played there. By the 1920s, it had become clear that \"The Gymnasium\" (by then renamed \"The Ladies' Gym\") was inadequate to house the university's basketball team. Records show Kentucky was 17–14 at State College Gymnasium.\nCumulative all-time statistics.\nKentucky can also lay claim to several individual achievements for both players and coaches:\nKentucky also holds several other NCAA records and various additional accomplishments:\nReferences.\nForde, P.

        "title": "North Alabama Lions women's volleyball",
        "text": "The University of North Alabama women's volleyball program is one of the most successful collegiate athletic programs in the United States, holding numerous conference and regional titles and one Division II national championship, earned in 2003.\nHistory.\nDespite its reputation as one of the nation's premiere women's athletic program, the UNA volleyball program claims humble beginnings. It began in 1969 as an extramural program of the Physical Education Department of what was then known as Florence State University. During this period, the team competed against all state schools as a member of the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. The team competed in the Northern District against Jacksonville State, Alabama A&amp;M, Montevallo, Southern Benedictine and Stillman.\nCoached by Physical Education instructor Don McBrayer, the Lady Lions posted numerous successes, including a state championship win over the University of Alabama in 1975. The Lady Lions also defeated Troy State, Auburn and Montevallo before prevailing over Alabama.\nAnother milestone in the program was crossed in 1976, when Lillian Goodlow, a premiere basketball and volleyball player at Bradshaw High School in Florence, became the first female athlete in UNA history to be awarded an athletic scholarship.\nFirst Conference Title in 1982.\nYet another major step was taken in 1982, when the Gulf South Conference first began awarding championships in women's sports. UNA's volleyball team earned the first official lead title for women with a 3-0 win over Jacksonville State.\nThe Lady Lions went on to win six of the first seven GSC volleyball championships.\nIn 1995, Matt Peck was hired as head coach. Over the following decade, Peck led the Lions to eight NCAA appearances, four trips to the Elite Eight, two Final Fours and the 2003 Division II National Championship.\nIn 1996, the Lions amassed a 44-4 record that included UNA's seventh GSC championship and the first ever NCAA Tournament appearance by an Alabama team. In 1997, UNA claimed its second GSC Tournament title and earned its second NCAA Regional bid.\nUNA became the first GSC institution to advance to the NCAA Division II Elite Eight in 1998. Moreover, the Lions earned their third straight GSC title and first-ever NCAA regional championship. UNA player also became the first volleyball player in GSC history to be selected a first-team All-American.\nIn 1999, with a 35-7 record, UNA won its fourth straight GSC title and completed its fourth straight NCAA appearance, advancing to the Elite Eight for the second time.\nUNA won its fifth straight GSC title, completed a fifth straight NCAA trip and ascended to the Division II Final Four for the first time. Team members Ashley Moffitt and Nesrin Secklin also earned All-American Honors in 2000 and 2001.\nThe following year, UNA made GSC history, winning its seventh straight conference title and 13th overall volleyball crown.\nFirst National Title for a UNA Women's Team.\nHowever, 2003 was a year marked with irony. While the team failed to win a GSC title for the first time in eight years, it excelled in the NCAA South Central Regional, Elite Eight and Final Four to secure the first national championship ever claimed by a UNA women's athletic team.\nThe team regained its GSC title in 2004.\nIn 2006, the Lions lacked only one victory winning the national championship, falling to top-ranked Tampa in the finals of the NCAA Tournament in Pensacola, Florida."

        "title": "Scottish Premiership (rugby union)",
        "text": "The Scottish Premiership (referred to as the Tennents Premiership for sponsorship reasons) is the highest level of amateur league competition for Scottish rugby union clubs. First held in 1973, it is the top division of the Scottish League Championship. The most recent (2023) champions are Hawick who are also the most successful club who have won the competition thirteen times.\nTen clubs contest the league, with the bottom club relegated to the Scottish National League Division One and second-bottom club involved in a play-off.\nThe top level of club rugby in Scotland are the two professional teams – Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby – that play in the United Rugby Championship. They assign their players to the clubs below in a Pro-Draft; so that they can still play when not used by the professional sides. From season 2019–20 a semi-professional championship in Scotland, known as the Super 6, was introduced – its teams no longer taken part in the Premiership competition. The Super 6 format is intended to bridge the gap between the amateur grade and the professional United Rugby Championship teams.\nHistory.\nUp to season 1972–73, Scotland's rugby union clubs participated in what was known as the Scottish Unofficial Championship. It provided very unbalanced competition: some clubs played more fixtures than others and some fixture lists provided stiffer opposition than others. The resulting league table at the end of each season gave a very unbalanced and difficult-to-comprehend set of results.\nStarting in season 1973–74, the Scottish Rugby Union organised the full member clubs into six leagues. This suited some of the 'open' clubs but many of the older former pupils clubs found it difficult to compete successfully and were forced into going 'open' themselves to try to recruit some of the better players. Those that didn't declined. Open clubs kept their old FP or Academical name, and still played on grounds owned by the schools. In the first 14 seasons of league rugby the Division I championship was won by Hawick on ten occasions.\nOne consequence was soon apparent: fewer players were selected from English clubs to represent Scotland. For the first time since before the First World War, the domestic game was producing an adequate number of players of genuine international class. Though the SRU's administrators were often seen as backward looking, Scotland had a national league before England, Wales or Ireland.\nHeriot's FP became the first city club to win the championship, they had already attracted \"outsiders\"; their leading try-scorer was Bill Gammell, a Fettesian already capped for the Scotland national rugby union team while playing for Edinburgh Wanderers. League rugby drew the crowds, and the 20 years that followed its introduction were the best in the history of Scottish club rugby. In that period the title of champions rarely went out of the Borders: with Hawick, Gala and Melrose enjoying long periods of ascendancy. Recently, however, the Borders domination has faded and Glasgow Hawks won the title three times in successive years between 2003 and 2004 and 2005–06.\nSince the advent of the leagues, the Scottish Rugby Union and its member clubs have re-organised the competition several times, usually to change the number of teams.\nThe top Scottish clubs qualified to the British and Irish Cup from 2009 to 2014.\nCompetition format.\nEach of the 10 clubs play each other at home and away between August and January, resulting in 18 games played by each club. Four points are awarded for a win, two for a draw and zero for a loss. Bonus points are also on offer in each game – one for scoring four or more tries and the other for the losing club finishing within seven points of the winning club.\nPlay-off.\nFrom season 2014–15 an end of season play-off was introduced for the top four clubs in the table. These clubs take part in a knock-out competition, with first playing third and second playing fourth in a semi-final match at the home venue of the highest finishing clubs. The winners then face each other in the final to determine the Premiership champion.\nPromotion and Relegation.\nThe 10th-placed club is relegated to Scottish National League Division One and replaced by the winners of National League Division One. The 9th-placed club takes part in a play-off match at a neutral venue with the 2nd-placed club in National League Division One. Although the Super 6 established in 2019 is above the Premiership in the national hierarchy and its clubs were selected directly from the existing members, as of 2021 its format was a 'closed shop' with no movement of teams between the Super 6 and the Premiership.\n2022-23 Clubs.\nRelegated to National 1\nPromoted from National 1"

He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Boston Braves, and Brooklyn Dodgers between 1942 and 1951.\nBackground.\nRussell was born in Fayette City, Pennsylvania, on October 1, 1918, the son of James Walch \"Doc\" Russell and Lillian Johnson. Russell never finished high school, but instead went out to work mines to bolster his family's financial situation. Jim played baseball with rocks (for balls) and tree limbs (for bats) in alleyways when he was a youngster. As a youth, he contracted rheumatic fever twice; his baseball career would be shortened because of his rheumatic heart disease.\nBaseball career.\nRussell, a switch hitter who threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed After beginning his minor league career in 1937, his contract was bought by the Pittsburgh Pirates in September 1942. In , Russell led the Pirates in hitting with a .312 batting average and 181 total hits, and hit the first pinch-hit home run in Pirates history on August 20.\nRussell was traded in November 1947 to the Boston Braves in a five-player transaction that included Danny Murtaugh, Johnny Hopp and Bill Salkeld. He was the pennant-winning Braves' regular center fielder in , starting 80 of Boston's 98 games played through early August. But then he was stricken with bacterial endocarditis brought on by the rheumatic fever he had as a child. It cost him the rest of the season and a chance to play in the 1948 World Series.\nHe was able to play again for the Braves in , but the heart problem slowly degraded his ability, as he had a .231 batting average. Russell was claimed on waivers from the Braves after the 1949 season by the Brooklyn Dodgers. He spent the next two seasons shuttling between the parent club and the Dodgers' top farm team in Montreal. In 1952 and 1953, he returned to the minors and finished his playing career with the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League.\nAs a big-leaguer, Russell appeared in 1,035 games played over his ten-season career and batted .267 with 428 RBI. His 959 hits included 175 doubles, 51 triples and 67 home runs. Defensively, he recorded an overall .981 fielding percentage playing at all three outfield positions and first base.\nFrom 1954 until 1963, he scouted for the Dodgers and Washington Senators.\nThe first player in Pittsburgh Pirates history to hit a grand slam as a pinch-hitter, Russell was also the first player in Major League Baseball history to homer from both sides of the plate in the same game on two separate occasions, doing so on June 7, 1948 for the Boston Braves and on July 26, 1950 while with the Brooklyn Dodgers. He also had a pair of doubles in the 1948 game for 12 total bases."

It was composed of five teams from Michigan and one from Windsor, Ontario. This six-team league never really got off the ground, playing a minimal 35 game schedule. The league lost one Michigan team that disbanded in 1913. This action helped cause the league's downfall.

        "text": "The men's individual time trial event at the UCI Road World Championships is the men's world championship for the road bicycle racing discipline of time trial. Introduced in 1994 by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), the world's governing body of cycling, the event consists of a time trial covering a distance of approximately 45 kilometres (28 mi) over flat or rolling terrain. Riders start separated by two-minute intervals; the one that completes the course in the shortest time is the winner, and is entitled to wear the rainbow jersey in time trial events for the forthcoming season.\nSwitzerland's Fabian Cancellara (2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010) and Germany's Tony Martin (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2016) have won the most competitions, with four each. Australia's Michael Rogers (2003, 2004 and 2005) is next by number of victories, with three wins; Martin and Rogers are the only people to have taken three wins in successive years. Bradley Wiggins is the oldest winner of the event, at 34 years and 149 days old when he won in 2014, while Remco Evenepoel is the youngest winner, at 23 years and 198 days old when he won in 2023.\nGermany's Michael Rich has finished second on three occasions, and is the most successful rider not to have won the event, with a total of four medals. Cancellara has the most third-place finishes, with three. German cyclists are the most successful, with seven victories, while Swiss and Australian cyclists are second with five each. The current male champion is Belgian rider Remco Evenepoel, who won the 2023 event.\nHistory.\nBefore 1994, the cyclists who performed well in the time trials during the three Grand Tours were considered the best in the world. The first event, at the 1994 UCI Road World Championships in Agrigento, Italy, was won by British cyclist Chris Boardman, ahead of Italy's Andrea Chiurato. Tour de France winner Miguel Induráin won the event the following year, beating fellow Spaniard Abraham Olano by forty-nine seconds. Alex Zülle, the 1996 Vuelta a España winner, won the rainbow jersey in his home country, ahead of Boardman and fellow Swiss cyclist Tony Rominger. The following year, Frenchman Laurent Jalabert beat Ukraine's Serhiy Honchar to the world title by three seconds in Valkenburg. Olano won the event in 1998, beating his fellow Spaniard Melcior Mauri by thirty-seven seconds.\nGermany's Jan Ullrich won the event in 1999, beating Swedish rider Michael Andersson by fourteen seconds around the course in Treviso. Ullrich did not participate in the 2000 world championships in Plouay, and Honchar took the world title in his absence, beating Ullrich's countryman Michael Rich by ten seconds. The Ukrainian was happy to win the event after previous runner-up and third-place finishes: \"I'm really satisfied, after the silver and bronze, I've finally got my World Championship.\" Ullrich returned the following year and reclaimed the rainbow jersey, beating Britain's David Millar by six seconds in Lisbon. Ullrich again decided against defending his title in 2002, leaving Santiago Botero to become the first Colombian to win a World Championship gold medal, as he beat Rich by eight seconds. Millar won the event in 2003; however, he was stripped of the title a year later after being found guilty of doping. Second-placed Michael Rogers was subsequently awarded the victory. He finished ahead of the next competitor, Uwe Peschel, by less than a second.\nRogers retained the title the following two years, finishing a minute and twelve seconds ahead of Rich in 2004, and twenty-three seconds ahead of Spain's Iván Gutiérrez in 2005. Rogers's run came to an end the following year, as Switzerland's Fabian Cancellara secured the victory in Salzburg, one minute and eighteen seconds ahead of American rider David Zabriskie. The Swiss defended his title in 2007, finishing ahead of Hungarian and Dutch cyclists László Bodrogi and Stef Clement. Germany's Bert Grabsch succeeded Cancellara, who was absent from the 2008 event in Varese, winning the title ahead of Canada's Svein Tuft and Zabriskie. Cancellara returned in 2009 and reclaimed the rainbow jersey after beating Sweden's Gustav Larsson and Germany's Tony Martin in Mendrisio. He won the rainbow jersey for a record fourth time the following year, with Millar and Martin finishing second and third, respectively. Cancellara was unsure whether he would compete beforehand, but stated: \"It's maybe the hardest of all my wins because leading up to this I wasn't sure of my condition.\"\nAfter two consecutive third-place finishes, Martin was victorious in 2011, beating Bradley Wiggins and defending champion Cancellara by a minute and fifteen seconds. He retained the rainbow jersey the following year; however, the margin of victory was considerably smaller as he beat the American Taylor Phinney by five seconds. In 2013, Martin won the event for a third consecutive time, again overcoming Wiggins and Cancellara. After two runner-up finishes, Wiggins prevented Martin's fourth successive win in the following season, taking the world title for the first time. Wiggins decided not to take part in 2015, focusing instead on breaking the hour record. In his absence, the winner was Belarusian cyclist Vasil Kiryienka, who came in third to Martin in 2012, beating Italy's Adriano Malori and France's Jérôme Coppel.\nMedal winners.\nMost successful cyclists.\nThe most successful cyclists are listed below and ranked by in order gold, silver and bronze medals won.\nMedallists by nation.\nNations are ranked in order of number of gold, silver and bronze medals won."

        "text": "The 2008 Tennis Masters Cup was a men's tennis tournament played on indoor hard courts. It was the 39th edition of the year-end singles championships, the 34th edition of the year-end doubles championships, and part of the 2008 ATP Tour. It took place at the Qizhong Forest Sports City Arena in Shanghai, China, from November 9 through November 16, 2008.\nAssociation of Tennis Professionals (ATP) No. 3 Novak Djokovic of Serbia won his first year-end championships title in the singles event, defeating ATP No. 5 Nikolay Davydenko of Russia in the final 6–1, 7–5. Four-time winner, two-time defending champion Roger Federer was defeated in the round-robin stage of the event for the first time in seven consecutive appearances. Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjić of Serbia won the doubles event 7–6, 6–2 over Americans Bob and Mike Bryan in the final for their first year-end championships doubles title together. With the win, they clinched the year-end No. 1 spot for the first time together. Nestor successfully defended his 2007 Tennis Masters Cup title with his new partner Zimonjić, while the other defending champion, Mark Knowles, lost in the round robin, with Mahesh Bhupathi.\nIt was the last time that the singles and doubles year-end championships took place in Shanghai as the Tennis Masters Cup. Starting in 2009, the season-ending event went to London, United Kingdom, at the O2 arena, under the new name of ATP World Tour Finals. Shanghai instead received a newly created event in the 2009 season, the Shanghai Masters, which take places earlier in the ATP calendar.\nFinals.\nSingles.\n Novak Djokovic defeated Nikolay Davydenko 6–1, 7–5\nDoubles.\n Daniel Nestor / Nenad Zimonjić defeated Bob Bryan / Mike Bryan 7–6(7–3), 6–2\nQualification.\nSpots were awarded to the top seven players and the top seven doubles teams in the 2008 ATP Race, with one spot reserved for Grand Slam champions who finished within the Top 20 players or teams of the ATP Race rankings. Two more players and teams also went to Shanghai as alternates in case of withdrawals.\nSingles.\nOn July 9 – after the 2008 Wimbledon Championships – the first three players to qualify for the 2008 year-end championships were selected: ATP No. 2 Rafael Nadal of Spain, World No. 1 Roger Federer of Switzerland and third-ranked Novak Djokovic of Serbia. These players, who held the top three spots of the ATP rankings during the whole year, secured their fourth, seventh and second appearance respectively in the season's finale.\nRafael Nadal, who reached his first hard courts Grand Slam semifinal at the Australian Open (lost to Tsonga), qualified after winning the French Open for a fourth consecutive time, matching Björn Borg's record performance from 1978 to 1981. He broke Roger Federer's streak of five consecutive titles in Wimbledon as he defeated the Swiss 6–4, 6–4, 6–7, 6–7, 9–7, in a four-hour-forty-eight-minute-long final – the second longest championship match in Wimbledon's history – to become the first tennis player to complete the Roland-Garros/Wimbledon double since Borg. In addition to the two Grand Slam titles, Nadal had also, at the time of his qualification, reached two finals in Chennai (lost to Youhzny) and Miami (lost to Davydenko), won his fourth consecutive title in Monte Carlo (def. Federer) and at Barcelona (def. Ferrer), and his first in Hamburg (def. Federer) and at London's Queen's Club (def. Djokovic), where he became, two weeks before his Wimbledon victory, the first Spaniard to win a grass court title since Andrés Gimeno in 1972. After his qualification, Nadal clinched a second title at the Canada Masters (def. Kiefer), a gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics (def. González), and a semifinal run at the US Open (lost to Murray). On August 18, after 160 weeks at ATP No. 2, Rafael Nadal overtook Roger Federer, breaking his 237-week streak at the top spot, to become the 24th player to hold the No. 1 rank in the twenty-five years of computerised-rankings history. Nadal eventually withdrew in the run-up to the tournament, citing fatigue.\nRoger Federer started his 2008 campaign with his first exit before the final in a major event since a 2005 defeat by Rafael Nadal at the French Open, when he lost in the Australian Open semifinals to Djokovic. After announcing he had contracted mononucleosis in December 2007, Federer hired clay-court specialist José Higueras to coach him, first during the clay court season, but eventually for the rest of the year. Federer qualified after he reached his third consecutive French Open final (lost to Nadal), where he suffered a 6–1, 6–3, 6–0 defeat, and his sixth consecutive Wimbledon final (lost to Nadal). After failing to beat the five-consecutive-title streak at the All England Club record and losing his third Grand Slam tournament in a row for the first time since 2002, Federer described the Wimbledon final as his \"hardest loss by far\". When he qualified, Federer had lost two more finals to Nadal in Monte Carlo and Hamburg, and won only two ATP International Series titles in Estoril (def. Davydenko) and Halle (def. Kohlschreiber). Despite losing his number 1 spot to Nadal in August, the rest of Federer's season featured better results with a third consecutive title in Basel (def. Nalbandian), and a fifth straight victory at the US Open (def. Murray) which brought him one Grand Slam title short of Pete Sampras's record of fourteen.\nNovak Djokovic had the best start of the season, as the Serb reached his second straight Grand Slam final after the 2007 US Open, and won his first major title at the Australian Open (def. Tsonga), becoming the first man other that Federer or Nadal to win a Grand Slam since Marat Safin in Melbourne three years before. Djokovic reached his fifth straight Grand Slam semifinal at the French Open (lost to Nadal), but suffered his earliest exit in a major since a first round loss at the 2006 Australian Open, in the second round of the Wimbledon Championships (lost to Safin). In the first part of the year, Djokovic also reached the London's Queen's Club final (lost to Nadal), and won two ATP Masters Series titles in Indian Wells (def. Fish) and Rome (def. Wawrinka). After qualifying for the year-end event, Djokovic lost to Nadal in the semifinals of the Beijing Olympics tennis event, but defeated James Blake in the third place match to win a Bronze Medal for Serbia. Despite this run, Djokovic failed to win another title in 2008 until the Tennis Masters Cup. He could not defend his 2007 final appearance at the US Open (lost to Federer), reaching only two tournaments finals in Cincinnati (lost to Murray) and Bangkok (lost to Tsonga).\nThe fourth qualifier, announced after the US Open on September 9, was Andy Murray of Great Britain, who secured his first Tennis Masters Cup ticket – the first for a Briton since Tim Henman in the 2004 edition.\nAndy Murray, who started the year just outside the Top Ten, qualified after improving his Grand Slam performances throughout the season. After defeats in the first round of the Australian Open (lost to Tsonga), and in the third round of the French Open (lost to Almagro), Murray reached his first quarterfinals in a major at the Wimbledon Championships (lost to Nadal), after coming back from a two-sets-to-love deficit to beat 2007 Wimbledon semifinalist Richard Gasquet in the fourth round. Murray capped his season in majors with his first Grand Slam final – the first for a Briton since Greg Rusedski lost in the 1997 US Open final – at the US Open (lost to Federer), after defeating Nadal, in his first tournament as World No. 1, in the semifinals. By that time in the season, Murray had already won two International Series titles in Doha (def. Wawrinka), Marseille (def. Ančić) and his first Masters Series shield in Cincinnati (def. Djokovic). Murray consolidated his fourth place in the rankings after the US Open by winning two more titles at the Madrid Masters (def. Simon) and in Saint Petersburg (def. Golubev), where he was the defending champion.\nThe fifth player to be selected, on October 19, was Nikolay Davydenko of Russia, who obtained his fourth consecutive qualification for the year-end championships.\nNikolay Davydenko, a two-time Grand Slam semifinalist in 2007, never went into second week at a major in 2008. He had early exits in the fourth round at the Australian Open (lost to Youzhny), in the third round at the French Open (lost to Ljubičić), in the first round at the Wimbledon Championships (lost to Becker), and in the fourth round at the US Open (lost to Müller). Though he did not defend his 2007 title in Moscow, Davydenko performed better in smaller events in 2008, reaching an International Series final in Estoril (lost to Federer), and winning two International Series titles in Pörtschach (def. Mónaco) and Warsaw (def. Robredo), and his second career Masters shield in Miami (def. Nadal).\nThe last three qualifiers, who locked their spots during the final event before the year-end championships, at the Paris Masters, were Andy Roddick of the United States, qualified for the sixth straight year (withdrew in 2005) on October 30, Juan Martín del Potro of Argentina, and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga of France, who both qualified in the last two days of the event and ended in the Top Eight for the first time.\nAndy Roddick did not perform as well as in previous seasons in Grand Slam tournaments, exiting in the third round of the Australian Open (lost to Kohlschreiber), withdrawing from the 2008 French Open (due to a right shoulder injury contracted in the semifinals of the Rome Masters), crashing in a four-setter in the second round of Wimbledon (lost to Tipsarević), and matching his 2007 US Open performance with a quarterfinal in New York (lost to Djokovic). During the rest of the season, Roddick lost one final in Los Angeles (lost to del Potro), and captured three titles in San Jose (def. Štěpánek), Dubai (def. López), and Beijing (def. Sela), clinching the qualification when he reached the quarterfinals of the Paris Masters.\nJuan Martín del Potro lost in the second round of all first three majors; at the Australian Open (lost to Ferrer), the French Open (lost to Bolelli), and Wimbledon (lost to Wawrinka). After Wimbledon, del Potro went on to win his first four titles in as many tournaments in Stuttgart (def. Gasquet), Kitzbühel (def Melzer), Los Angeles (def. Roddick) and Washington (def. Troicki), becoming the first player ever to do so. In the rest of the year, del Potro extended his 23-match streak to the quarterfinals of the US Open (lost to Murray), and reached another final in Tokyo (lost to Berdych). Del Potro's qualification came during the Paris Masters, when Tsonga defeated other Masters Cup hopeful James Blake, the only other contender for del Potro's place, in the semifinals.\nJo-Wilfried Tsonga, ranked 38 on January 1, defeated Murray, Gasquet and Nadal en route to his first final in the ATP Tour at the Australian Open (lost to Djokovic). Sidelined during three months of the season due to a right knee injury, Tsonga missed both the French Open and Wimbledon, coming back to competition at the US Open where he was defeated in the third round (lost to Robredo). Tsonga won his first career title in a rematch of the Australian Open final in the International Series event of Bangkok (def. Djokovic), and earned his Tennis Masters Cup qualification with his second career title (his first Masters Series shield) at the Paris Masters (def. Nalbandian).\nAfter Nadal's withdrawal on November 3, the ninth player of the ATP Race, Gilles Simon of France, was elevated to the playing field, for his first career qualification.\nGilles Simon, one of fifteen Frenchmen of the ATP Top 100 at the beginning of the year, did not perform well in Grand Slam events, losing in the third round of the Australian Open (lost to Nadal), the first round of the French Open (lost to Štěpánek), the third round of Wimbledon (lost to Gasquet), and the third round of the US Open (lost to del Potro). His ninth place at the race resulted from three titles in Casablanca (def. Benneteau), Indianapolis (def. Tursunov), and Bucharest (def. Moyá), a semifinals run at the Canada Masters, and a final at the Madrid Masters (lost to Murray).\nDoubles.\nThe first two teams to qualify for the year-end doubles tournament were selected on July 9. They were World No. 1 duo Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan from the United States, and then-ATP Race-leaders Daniel Nestor of Canada and Nenad Zimonjić of Serbia. The Bryan brothers qualified for their sixth straight Tennis Masters Cup appearance (withdrew in 2007), while Nestor qualified for the tenth time, the first with another partner than Mark Knowles, and Zimonjić qualified for the third time.\nBob Bryan and Mike Bryan started their 2008 season with an unsuccessful defense of their 2007 Australian Open title, where they were upset in the quarterfinals of the Australian Open (lost to Bhupathi/Knowles). The Bryans matched their 2007 French Open performance with a quarterfinal appearance in Paris (lost to Cuevas/Horna), but were again upset before the final in Wimbledon (lost to Björkman/Ullyett), leaving the tournament without ever dropping serve. When they qualified, the Bryan brothers had already reached eight finals, losing five – in Sydney (lost to Gasquet/Tsonga), Delray Beach (lost to Mirnyi/Murray), San Jose (lost to Lipsky/Martin), Las Vegas (lost to Benneteau/Llodra), and Hamburg (lost to Nestor/Zimonjić) – and winning the other three in Miami (def. Bhupathi/Knowles), Barcelona (def. Fyrstenberg/Matkowski), and Rome (def. Nestor/Zimonjić). After Wimbledon, the Bryans entered the US Open without a Grand Slam title for the first time since 2005. They ended their title drought in majors by winning their second final in New York (def. Dlouhý/Paes), their sixth Grand Slam crown overall. The Bryans also won the bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, defeating Clément/Llodra, after they were upset in the semifinals by Federer/Wawrinka, and reached two more finals, losing in Toronto (lost to Nestor/Zimonjić), and winning in Cincinnati (def. Erlich/Ram).\nDaniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić, who had previously partnered for four events in 2007, started their first full season together with an appearance in the Australian Open quarterfinals (lost to Clément/Llodra), and the final of the French Open, which Nestor had won the previous year with Knowles (lost to Cuevas/Horna). The pair qualified after winning their first Grand Slam title together at the Wimbledon Championships (def. Björkman/Ullyett). The title was Zimonjić's first in a major after three lost finals, and completed Nestor's career Golden Slam, having previously won the three other majors and the Gold Medal at the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Nestor and Zimonjić's partnership also led them to three ATP Masters Series finals in Indian Wells (lost to Erlich/Ram), Rome (lost to Bryan/Bryan), and Hamburg (def. Bryan/Bryan), and a final at London's Queen's Club (def. Melo/Sá). After clinching their first ticket as a team for the Tennis Masters Cup, Nestor and Zimonjić, who held the top spot of the ATP Race for several weeks, lost early in the third round of the US Open (lost to Nieminen/Lindstedt), and win one more title in Toronto (def. Bryan/Bryan).\nThe third team to qualify, announced on September 9, was the pairing of Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram from Israel, who participated in the 2006 and 2007 editions of the event, losing each time in the round robin.\nJonathan Erlich and Andy Ram kicked off their season with their first Grand Slam title at the Australian Open (def. Clément/Llodra), becoming the first Israeli players to capture a major title in tennis history. Erlich and Ram did not match that performance in the remaining majors of the year, exiting in the third round at the French Open, in the quarterfinals at Wimbledon (lost to Dlouhý/Paes), and in the second round at the US Open (lost to Robredo/Roitman). Upset in the first round of the Olympic doubles event by Clément/Llodra, Erlich and Ram reached two other tournaments finals in the season, in Masters Series events of Indian Wells (def. Nestor/Zimonjić) and Cincinnati (lost to Bryan/Bryan). Sidelined by a recurring elbow injury since the Davis Cup World Group play-offs against Peru, Erlich did not participate in any event after the US Open. Partnering with different other players in the rest of the season, Ram won two more titles; partnering with Max Mirnyi in Vienna (def. Petzschner/Peya) and in Lyon, and partnering with Michaël Llodra (def. Huss/Hutchins).\nThe fourth and fifth teams selected for the Tennis Masters Cup, on October 19, were the pairing of Mahesh Bhupathi from India and Mark Knowles – one of the two defending champions – from The Bahamas, who secured respectively their eighth and eleventh spots for the season championships, and the then-13th-ranked duo of Pablo Cuevas from Uruguay and Luis Horna from Peru, who qualified as Grand Slam champions certain to finish the year within the Top 20 of the ATP Race rankings, and reached the year-end event for the first time.\nMahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles started competing together in 2008 with a deep run at the Australian Open, in which they defeated defending champions Bryan/Bryan, before losing in the semifinals (lost to Erlich/Ram). Bhupathi and Knowles exited in the first round of the French Open, where Knowles was the defending champion (lost to Huss/Hutchins), and in Wimbledon (lost to Petzschner/Peya). At the US Open, the pair did not get past the third round (lost to González/Mónaco). Despite the poor season in majors, Bhupathi and Knowles reached five finals in Vienna (lost to Mirnyi/Ram), Madrid (lost to Fyrstenberg/Matkowski), Memphis (def. Ratiwatana/Ratiwatana), Dubai (def. Damm/Vízner), Basel (def. Kas/Kohlschreiber).\nPablo Cuevas and Luis Horna did not start their partnership until the French Open, in which they upset four seeded teams (Clément/Llodra; Dlouhý/Paes; Bryan/Bryan; Nestor/Zimonjić) to win their first Grand Slam title, the first ever claimed by a South American team. Cuevas and Horna entered two more tournaments together in the rest of the season, losing in the second round of the US Open (lost to de Voest/Fisher), and the first in Washington (lost to Gicquel/Lindstedt). The pair had more success separately, as Cuevas reached the final in Houston, partnering with Marcel Granollers (lost to Gulbis/Schüttler), and Horna won two titles in Auckland, partnering with Juan Mónaco (def. Malisse/Melzer), and Buenos Aires, partnering with Agustín Calleri (def. Eschauer/Luczak).\nThe sixth and seventh teams to enter the field on October 26 were the duo of Jonas Björkman of Sweden and Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe, who qualified for their seventh and fifth year-end finale (their first together), and the pair of Lukáš Dlouhý of the Czech Republic and Leander Paes of India, who qualified for their second and ninth year-end finale (their first together).\nJonas Björkman and Kevin Ullyett reached the quarterfinals at the French Open (lost to Soares/Vemic), the first major of their season, and were defeated in the Wimbledon final (lost to Nestor/Zimonjić). Set to retire at the end of 2008, Björkman entered the US Open and was knocked out in the second round (lost to Kas/Petzschner). Björkman and Ullyett had won one title together in Stockholm (def. Brunström/Ryderstedt) by October, then clinched one more after they qualified, in Paris (def. Coetzee/Moodie). Björkman also won in Båstad (def. Brunstrom/Rojer), partnering with Robin Söderling. Ullyett reached two finals with Bruno Soares in Nottingham (def. Coetzee/Murray) and Washington (lost to Gicquel/Lindstedt), and one with Jamie Murray in Estoril (lost to Coetzee/Moodie).\nLukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes, who started the season with different partners, František Čermák and Paul Hanley respectively, debuted their partnership at the French Open, where they reached the third round (lost to Cuevas/Horna), and found success in Wimbledon, where they reached the semifinals (lost to Nestor/Zimonjić), and the US Open, where they reached their first Grand Slam final together (lost to Bryan/Bryan). Aside from the majors, Dlouhý and Paes reached three other finals together: in Bangkok (def. Lipsky/Martin), Halle (lost to Youhzny/Zverev), and Tokyo (lost to Youzhny/Zverev).\nAt the Paris Masters, several teams competed for the last spot of the Tennis Masters Cup doubles event. Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie from South Africa eventually finished runners-up, gathering enough points to reach their first year-end event together – the first ever for Coetzee, the second for Moodie (after 2005).\nJeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie climbed to the eighth place of the Race starting with a semifinal at the Australian Open (lost to Clément/Llodra), followed by early losses in the second round of the French Open (lost to Tipsarević/Troicki), and of Wimbledon (lost to López/Verdasco). Coetzee partnered with Rogier Wassen at the US Open, where they were beaten in the first round (lost to González/Mónaco). Coetzee and Moodie reached three tournaments finals together during the season: in Doha (lost to Kohlschreiber/Škoch), Estoril (def. Murray/Ullyett), and Paris (lost to Björkman/Ullyett). Individually, Coetzee also reached two finals in Marseille, partnering with Yves Allegro (lost to Damm/Vizner), and Nottingham, partnering with Jamie Murray (lost to Soares/Ullyett).\nAfter Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram's withdrawal on November 3, the eighth team of the ATP Doubles Race, Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski of Poland, were selected as replacements.\nMariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski never got further than the third round in majors in 2008, exiting in the third at the Australian Open (lost to Bhupathi/Knowles), the second at the French Open (lost to Mertiňák/Scherrer), and the first in Wimbledon (lost to Bopanna/Qureshi) and at the US Open (lost to Andreev/Zverev). Despite the poor runs in majors, Fyrstenberg and Matkowski reached five finals in Barcelona (lost to Bryan/Bryan), Warsaw (def. Davydenko/Schukin), Bucharest (lost to Devilder/Mathieu), Metz (lost to Clément/Llodra), and Madrid (def. Bhupathi/Knowles).\nBuild-up.\nWithdrawals.\nFour days after retiring from his quarterfinal against Nikolay Davydenko at the Paris Masters due to a recurring right knee injury, ATP Race-leader Rafael Nadal announced on November 3 that he would withdraw from the year-end championships, for the second time in four qualifications. Nadal had already pulled out of the 2005 Tennis Masters Cup due to a left foot injury before his opening match against Gastón Gaudio, and was replaced by alternate Mariano Puerta. Nadal's withdrawal in 2008 happened as the Spaniard was scheduled to lead his country's Davis Cup team in the event's final, to be played five days after the Tennis Masters Cup in Mar del Plata, Argentina, on indoor hard courts, against an Argentinian team led by Stockholm titlist, Basel and Paris runner-up David Nalbandian, and other year-end event qualifier Juan Martín del Potro. Nadal cited the Davis Cup final necessary preparation as another reason to withdraw from the event, saying: \"I want to recover and be ready for the important Davis Cup final with my country that will be played in Mar del Plata, Argentina\". He eventually announced, on November 10, his withdrawal from the Davis Cup final (set to be played November 21–23), due to his knee injury.\nNadal's withdrawal elevated the first alternate, Gilles Simon, into the draw, making him the second Frenchman of the eight-men field, alongside Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, and marking the first time that two Frenchmen participated in the year-end event since the Masters Grand Prix event of 1986, in which Yannick Noah and Henri Leconte competed. Simon was ranked eighth in the ATP Race entering the Paris Masters thanks to his final in Madrid and his semifinal at the Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon, where he lost to eventual champion Robin Söderling, but was knocked out of the Top Eight when he lost to Andy Roddick in the third round, and Tsonga qualified by winning the title. Simon, who flew to Shanghai with countryman and friend Jo-Wilfried Tsonga on November 5, commented on Nadal's withdrawal and his first selection for the year-end event: \"I was unhappy that he had to pull out. I would really have preferred to qualify directly by finishing eighth. It's not in my nature to wish that another player can't play. [...] I'm really happy to be going there and I really want to experience this.\"\nOn the same day, Israeli Jonathan Erlich, who had been suffering from an elbow injury since September, also announced he was pulling out from the doubles field, alongside his partner Andy Ram, with whom he had won the Australian Open in January. Hoping that Erlich would be fit to play the year-end event, Ram had continued to compete with different players between September and the last ATP Tour event before the Masters Cup. During that period, he won a Davis Cup World Group Play-off match against Peru with Harel Levy, an ATP International Series Gold title in Vienna against Philipp Petzschner and Alexander Peya with Max Mirnyi, lost to Pablo Andújar and Marcel Granollers in the first round of the Madrid Masters with Mikhail Youzhny, won another title in Lyon against Stephen Huss and Ross Hutchins with Michaël Llodra, and eventually lost in the quarterfinals of the Paris Masters to Arnaud Clément and Michaël Llodra, with Bruno Soares.\nErlich and Ram's exit allowed the first alternates, Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski, to join the eight-team field days after they lost a chance to qualify regularly during the Paris Masters. Fyrstenberg and Matkowski, who had boosted their chances to qualify by winning the Madrid Masters, met Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie in the semifinals of Paris, as both teams were vying for the seventh spot of the Race. Fyrstenberg and Matkowski were then beaten in straight sets, and denied a guaranteed spot in Shanghai. Their qualification as alternates marked their second appearance at the Masters Cup after a previous run in 2006, where they lost all of their round robin matches.\nAlternates.\nAlthough the ATP Rulebook states that the two players immediately ranked after the last qualifier at the Masters Cup should be selected as singles alternates, and be present at the event's location, only two players ranked in the Top 35 of the ATP Race, after Gilles Simon, accepted the invitation to come to Shanghai : 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek of the Czech Republic, and 35th-ranked Nicolas Kiefer of Germany. Among the twenty-four players who declined to come – because they needed to prepare for the Davis Cup final, for reasons of injury, or to preserve themselves for the next season – were James Blake, David Nalbandian, 2007 Tennis Masters Cup finalist David Ferrer, Stanislas Wawrinka, 2007 qualifier Fernando González, Fernando Verdasco, Gaël Monfils, Robin Söderling, Igor Andreev, Nicolás Almagro, Tomáš Berdych, Tommy Robredo, Marin Čilić, Mardy Fish, 2007 qualifier Richard Gasquet, Ivo Karlović, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Dmitry Tursunov, Marat Safin, Feliciano López, Paul-Henri Mathieu, Mikhail Youzhny, Rainer Schüttler and Mario Ančić.\nCzech Radek Štěpánek, who started the year as No. 30 and ranked as high as No. 12 on July 7, had his best Grand Slam performance at the French Open, where he reached the fourth round, losing to David Ferrer in five sets on the score of 4–6, 6–2, 1–6, 6–3, 6–3. Štěpánek reached one final in the season in San Jose (lost to Roddick), and reached the semifinals at four events, in Sydney (lost to Guccione), Memphis (lost to Söderling), Rome (retired due to illness against Djokovic), and Metz (lost to Tursunov).\nFormer World No. 4 Nicolas Kiefer, who qualified once for the year-end event at the 1999 ATP Tour World Championships, where he reached the semifinals (lost to Sampras), did not get past the third round at a Grand Slam event in 2008 but reached his first tournament final since Saint Petersburg in 2005, his first career ATP Masters Series final – and his only final of the season – at the Toronto Masters (lost to Nadal). His other best results included a semifinal in Halle (lost to Federer), and a quarterfinal at the Hamburg Masters (lost to Seppi).\nThe substitutes for the doubles event, ranked in the ninth position of the ATP Doubles Race, directly after Fyrstenberg and Matkowski, were Marcelo Melo and André Sá from Brazil.\nPartnering together since 2006, Marcelo Melo and André Sá advanced the third round in Grand Slam events in 2008, having been knocked out in the first round of the Australian Open (lost to Arnold Ker/López), the second at the French Open (lost to Ram/Reynolds), the third in Wimbledon (withdrew against Anderson/Lindstedt), and the first at the US Open (lost to Robredo/Roitman). The pair lost one final at London's Queen's Club (lost to Nestor/Zimonjić), but won three titles in Costa do Sauípe (def. Montañés/Ventura), Pörtschach (def. Knowle/Melzer), and New Haven (def. Bhupathi/Knowles).\nGroupings.\nThe draw ceremony, which divided the eight competing players/teams in the two round robin groups, took place on November 5, in Shanghai's Hilton hotel, in attendance by ATP No. 4 Andy Murray. With Rafael Nadal withdrawn due to a knee injury, Roger Federer took the top seed and the heading of the Red Group; Novak Djokovic took the second seed, headlining the Gold Group. Federer was drawn alongside Murray, Andy Roddick and Nadal's replacement Gilles Simon, while Djokovic was joined in his group by Nikolay Davydenko, Juan Martín del Potro and Jo-Wilfried Tsonga.\nThe Red Group's composition set several rematches of the year's encounters, confronting Federer with three players against which he lost in their last meeting – having been defeated by Roddick in the quarterfinals of the Miami Masters, losing to him for the second time in their seventeen matches against each other; by Simon in their only meeting in the second round of the Toronto Masters; and by Murray in the semifinals of the Madrid Masters. Federer and Murray's match was their fourth encounter of the year, after a first round match in Dubai (won by Murray), the US Open final (won by Federer), and a Madrid semifinal (won by Murray), which brought their head-to-head record to 2–3 in Murray's favor. The announced meeting of Murray and Simon was also a rematch, that of Madrid Masters' final, which Murray won in straight sets, defeating the Frenchman for the second time in the year, after a second round at the Hamburg Masters, to lead their head-to-head 2–1. Roddick's encounter with Simon was to be their third career meeting, the second in 2008 after a Paris Masters third round (won by Roddick), which helped the American clinch his spot at the Tennis Masters Cup, and prevented Simon to gather enough points to qualify directly for the event. Finally, Roddick and Murray's meeting, their seventh overall, in a head-to-head led by Murray 4–2, was to be their first real match of the year, as Murray withdrew due to a thumb injury before what could have been their previous 2008 encounter, in the Queen's Club Championships quarterfinals.\nGold Group leader Novak Djokovic, who lost all three of his round robin matches at the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup to Nadal, Richard Gasquet and David Ferrer, was set to meet Jo-Wilfried Tsonga for the fourth time of the year, having lost their last two meetings in Bangkok's final and Paris Masters' third round, after their first encounter in the Australian Open's final (won by Djokovic). Djokovic's eventual meetings with Davydenko and del Potro were also uncertain for the Serb, as Djokovic had to retire in his only encounter with Davydenko, in a deciding match of the Davis Cup's first round, and had not met del Potro since a third round at the 2007 US Open, before the Argentinian elevated his level of play in the end of 2008 to enter the Top Ten. Del Potro's meeting with Davydenko was to be their third overall, their second that year, and give an advantage in their head-to-head record to either player, who had previously won one match against each other, with Davydenko defeating del Potro in the second round of the 2007 Paris Masters –when del Potro, a qualifier, had a ranking of only 51–, and the Argentinian avenging this loss by crushing the Russian in the Davis Cup semifinals 6–1, 6–4, 6–2. Tsonga entered the competition with a 0–1 record against both del Potro and Davydenko, but with each meeting (versus del Potro in New Haven, versus Davydenko in Moscow) coming in the 2007 season, before the Frenchman's rise in the rankings.\nThe repartition of the doubles teams also took place, with Bob and Mike Bryan holding the top seed, and headlining the Red Group, and defending champion Daniel Nestor and new partner Nenad Zimonjić taking upon the second seed and the head of the Gold Group. With the Bryans landed Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles, Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie, and Pablo Cuevas and Luis Horna, while Nestor and Zimonjić were joined by Jonas Björkman and Kevin Ullyett, Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes, and Erlich and Ram's replacements Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski.\nRed Group top duo Bob and Mike Bryan, who had withdrawn from the 2007 Tennis Masters Cup due to an elbow injury for Mike Bryan, were set to face Mark Knowles, one of the two separated defending champions, and new partner Mahesh Bhupathi, for the fourth time in 2008, after meetings in the Australian Open quarterfinals (won by Bhupathi/Knowles), in the Miami Masters final (won by Bryan/Bryan), and in the Cincinnati Masters semifinals (won by Bryan/Bryan). The Bryans had also defeated Knowles, partnering fellow Bahamian Devin Mullings –then ranked 1017 in singles, not ranked in doubles– in the first round of the Beijing Olympics doubles tournament. The Bryan/Bryan-Coetzee/Moodie encounter was also a repeat of a matchup having already occurred three times in the season, at the Indian Wells Masters (won by Bryan/Bryan), the Miami Masters (won by Bryan/Bryan), and the Monte-Carlo Masters (won by Coetzee/Moodie). Coetzee and Moodie, after defeating the Bryans in Monte-Carlo Masters' quarterfinals, went on to lose in the semifinals to Bhupathi and Knowles, in their only meeting before the Masters Cup. Occasional doubles team of Cuevas and Horna, who competed in only three tournaments in the year, had a head-to-head record against only one of the three other teams, having upset the Bryan brothers in the French Open quarterfinals, en route to their Roland Garros title.\nIn the Gold Group were set rematches of the Wimbledon final, between champions Nestor and Zimonjić and Björkman and Ullyett, whose encounter at Wimbledon (won by Nestor/Zimonjić) was the only one in their career, as well as of a Wimbledon semifinal between Nestor and Zimonjić, and Dlouhý and Paes (won by Nestor/Zimonjić). Nestor and Zimonjić, and Dlouhý and Paes had met three times in the year before the Masters Cup, in the Wimbledon semifinal first, then in a Toronto Masters semifinal (won by Nestor/Zimonjić), and a Cincinnati Masters quarterfinal (won by Nestor/Zimonjić). The second seeds' perfect record in 2008 against Dlouhý and Paes also included a victory of the pair over Paes and Tommy Robredo in the Hamburg Masters semifinal, and of Nestor and Frédéric Niemeyer over Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi in the first round of Indianapolis, where both players were preparing for the Beijing Olympics. Previous matchups between the group's teams also included a 2–2 head-to-head record between Nestor and Zimonjić, and Fyrstenberg and Matkowski, with three meetings in 2008 in Sydney (won by Fyrstenberg/Matkowski), Rome (won by Nestor/Zimonjić), and Madrid (won by Fyrstenberg/Matkowski), and a second round in Monte Carlo between Fyrstenberg and Matkowski, and Björkman and Ullyett (won by Björkman/Ullyett). Finally, two encounters were to be first matchups in Shanghai, as neither Fyrstenberg and Matkowski nor Björkman and Ullyett entered the Tennis Masters Cup having played against the pairing of Dlouhý and Paes during the season.\nDay-by-day summaries.\nDay 1.\nThe first match of the competition to take place, on November 9, was the second career confrontation, in the doubles' Red Group, of Bob and Mike Bryan, and Pablo Cuevas and Luis Horna, since the South Americans upset the American duo at the French Open. The top seeded pair, which entered the tournament in a race with Gold Group leaders Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić to clinch the year-end No. 1 spot, overwhelmed Cuevas and Horna, in their fourth career hard court match together (with previously one win and two losses), racing to a 6–1 win in the first set, before their opponents fought back in the second, breaking to eventually lead 5–2, when the Americans rallied back to serve for the match at 6–5. Cuevas and Horna took the Bryans' serve once more to reach a tie-break, in which the Americans eventually prevailed to win the match 6–1, 7–6. The other match taking place on the first day opposed Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles to Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie, and left the Indian-Bahamian pair victorious for the second time in two career meetings. Bhupathi and Knowles faced little resistance, breaking their adversaries three times to score a 6–2, 6–3 victory.\nThe singles event kicked off later in the day, first opposing ATP No. 3 Novak Djokovic to seventh seed Juan Martín del Potro. No upset was produced, as Djokovic scored his first career victory at the year-end championships, after losing all his matches at the 2007 edition, and increased his head-to-head against del Potro to 2–0, beating the Argentinian in straight sets. Djokovic had broken early in the first set, and was serving for the set at 5–3, when del Potro broke, and reached 5–5, before Djokovic took back the advantage, to win the set 7–5. In the second set, del Potro broke to lead 2–1, but Djokovic immediately levelled the score to 2–2, breaking again later in the set, and keeping his lead to a 7–5, 6–3 victory, in little less than two hours. In the second Gold Group match of the day, Nikolay Davydenko faced recent Paris Masters champion Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, in their second career meeting. Both players held their serve in the first set, to a tie-break the Russian eventually lost 6–8, on an unforced error, and the second set was just as tight, until Davydenko made one break at 5–4, levelling the match to one-set-all. The Russian broke early in the final set, and was serving for the match at 5–2, when Tsonga started a comeback, taking the match to a crucial tie-break. Davydenko then proved too solid for Tsonga, repeating his own performance from their only previous meeting, in Moscow, where he had won 7–0 in a first set tie break, and scored again a perfect tie-break in Shanghai to win the match 6–7, 6–4, 7–6 after more than two hours and a half of play.\nDay 2.\nIn the doubles event, on November 10, second-seeded Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić faced Erlich and Ram's replacements Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski in the first doubles match of the day. The Canadian-Serbian pair edged a close win over the Poles to improve their head-to-head against them to 3–2 (2–2 in 2008). Nestor and Zimonjić faced strong competition in the first set, snatching a 7–4 victory in the tie-break, before Fyrstenberg and Matkowski levelled the score to one-set-all winning the second set 7–5, forcing the encounter into a match tie-break, in which Nestor and Zimonjić proved stronger, eventually claiming a 7–6, 5–7, [10–4] victory, in little less than two hours. The second match of the day, a first career meeting between Jonas Björkman, in his last appearance on the tour –his seventh at the year-end event, having won in 1994 and 2006– and Kevin Ullyett, and Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes, turned out an easier task for the veteran Björkman and partner Ullyett, as they lost merely ten points on their serve, and converted all their break opportunities, to win 6–3, 7–5, in just more than one hour.\nThe first of the two singles matches, both from the Red Group, saw Nadal's replacement Gilles Simon take on top seed Roger Federer, to record his second straight win against the Swiss in two career meetings. Federer took the first opportunity, breaking the Frenchman to lead 3–2 and win the set 6–4. The Swiss continued his domination early in the second set, breaking to 2–1, before Simon broke back to even the score. Both players held their serve until the last game, when the Frenchman, taking advantage of Federer's repeated forehand errors, broke to a 6–4 victory. Federer's errors kept on going, as Simon tightened his game, breaking the Swiss one more time, and clinching a 4–6, 6–4, 6–3 comeback victory, repeat of his first Toronto Masters win over Federer. The loss was Federer's fourth in his seven-year, thirty-matches Masters Cup history, and marked the second time he started the tournament with a round robin loss, after his defeat by Fernando González in 2007. The second match was set to be the first complete encounter of Andy Murray and Andy Roddick since a Memphis semifinal (won by Roddick), after a Miami Masters quarterfinal (Roddick retired) and a Queen's Club quarterfinal (Murray withdrew). In Shanghai, Murray converted his first break opportunities to win the first set 6–4. Roddick struck back in the second set, dominating the game to a 5–0 lead, closing on the set 6–1. The final set followed exactly the same pattern, with Murray taking the lead this time, to claim victory on the score of 6–4, 1–6, 6–1.\nDay 3.\nIn the doubles' Red Group matches, on November 11, Pablo Cuevas and Luis Horna recorded their first Masters Cup win, and their second hard court win together, against South Africans Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie, in the two teams' first ever meeting. Despite being broken once, the South American French Open champions dominated the first set, breaking three times themselves to win it 6–2. Both pairs held their serve in the second set, with Coetzee and Moodie taking the tie-break 7–2. The eighth seeds eventually claimed victory after clinching a close match tie-break, on the final score of 6–2, 6–7, [11–9], eliminating Coetzee and Moodie from the tournament. In the other encounter of the day, Bob and Mike Bryan scored their second victory in the round robin, defeating Mahesh Bhupathi and Mark Knowles for the third straight time in four meetings in 2008. The Americans snatched the first set 7–5 with a late break, before their opponents took the second set, breaking the Bryans twice to a 6–3 victory. As they did in their first round robin match, Bob and Mike Bryan edged out in the match tie-break, to finally score a 5–7, 6–4, [10–4] victory, and qualify for the semifinals.\nThe second series of two Gold Group matches took place, with Juan Martín del Potro coming out on top for the second time in two meetings with Jo-Wilfried Tsonga 7–6, 7–6. Both players broke their opponent's serve several times, despite the tie-breaks finishes, with del Potro taking the advantage in the first game, and Tsonga immediately breaking back to 2–2, to see the set end in a deciding tie-break the Argentinian took, on an unforced error by his adversary. The second set took the same start as the first, with a break by del Potro, this time held to a 5–4 advantage, when Tsonga once again broke back, forcing another tie-break. Del Potro was once more victorious in the set decider, to clinch his first Masters Cup victory. The match between the first day's winners, Nikolay Davydenko and Novak Djokovic, was their second meeting, after a Davis Cup first round encounter in which Djokovic retired, handing Russia a decisive victory. Davydenko broke in the first service game, holding his advantage until serving at 5–3. Djokovic then broke back, and the set went into a tie-break, which he won, as Davydenko's error count went up during the set decider. The Russian started a comeback, lining up seven straight games to win the second set with a bagel, and lead 1–0 in the third. Djokovic then saved two breaks points, and converted one at 5–5, with Davydenko's unforced errors giving him the break, and eventually the match, on the score of 7–6, 0–6, 7–5. The win meant Tsonga's elimination, and Djokovic's qualification for the semifinals.\nDay 4.\nTwo more matches of the doubles' Gold Group took place on November 12, with second-seeded Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić, vying for the year-end No. 1 spot, defeating in straight sets Jonas Björkman and Kevin Ullyett. The Canadian-Serbian team breezed by their opponents, saving all breaks points Björkman and Ullyett held against them, and breaking three times (twice in the first set and once in the second), to score a 6–1, 6–4 victory, the second career win over Björkman and Ullyett, following a close final at the Wimbledon Championships. In the second match, Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes faced Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski for the first time, with the Poles taking the close match in straight sets 7–6, 6–3. Neither team converted their break opportunities in the first set, before Fyrstenberg and Matkowski took the advantage in the tie-break, winning it 7–2. The second set was more competitive, as Dlouhý and Paes managed to score one break, but their opponents scored three, to eventually claim victory after less than two-hours-and-a-half. The results of the day assured Nestor and Zimonjić of a semifinal spot, and Dlouhý and Paes of the fourth place of the group.\nThe fourth day of the competition had started earlier with another withdrawal, as fifth seed and 2007 Masters Cup semifinalist Andy Roddick announced he was pulling out of the event, after injuring his ankle during a practice session on the previous day. \"Yesterday in the warm-up during practice I just went over on it. [...] We tried the best we could to get it better but I can't really stop and start on it very quickly.\" commented Roddick. The American's withdrawal allowed 26th-ranked Radek Štěpánek, who accepted the invitation to Shanghai as first alternate, after sixteen players ranked above him, and below last qualifier Gilles Simon, refused to come to the Masters Cup. Roddick said he had called Štěpánek, before deciding not to play, to tell him he might enter the competition : \"I called Štěpánek earlier today to let him know where my head was at, and then just told him when I came off the practice court. So he knew as early as anybody else.\" Štěpánek's unexpected appearance (Murray had commented \"Štěpánek's turned up without his own racquets, he borrowed some socks off me earlier and he hasn't got his contact lenses either\") marked the Czech's first career participation to the year-end championships.\nThe third match of the Red Group, in the singles event, was a repeat of the Madrid Masters final which Andy Murray had won over Gilles Simon in straight sets less than a month earlier. The World No. 4 made the strongest start of the match, quickly racing to a 4–0 lead. The Frenchman then fought back to 4–3, but failed to break Murray a second time, letting the Scot use his advantage to win the set 6–4. The second set was a formality for Murray, who saved all three break points he had against him, and took Simon's serve twice to record his second round robin win, 6–4, 6–2, after one-hour and a half of play. The unexpected line up of the second match of the day opposed top Roger Federer to Roddick's replacement, ninth-seeded Radek Štěpánek, for the fourth time in the year, after a Rome quarterfinal (won by Štěpánek), a US Open third round (won by Federer), and a Madrid second round (won by Federer). The Swiss broke in the opening game of the match, and led 2–1 when Štěpánek broke back to 2–2. Both players held their serve to a tie-break Federer eventually took 7–4, capitalizing on Štěpánek's unforced errors. Federer and Štěpánek continued to serve strongly in the second set, before the Swiss took the advantage at 4–3, to lead 5–3 and serve for the set. Štěpánek managed to break back one last time, but Federer took the Czech's serve again to close the match 7–6, 6–4, in less than two hours, already crushing Štěpánek's slim chances to leave the round robin, and allowing Murray to secure a semifinal berth.\nDay 5.\nThe final matches of the doubles' Red Group, on November 13, opposed, in a dead rubber, top-seeded Bob and Mike Bryan, already qualified for the semifinals, and Jeff Coetzee and Wesley Moodie, already assured of ending fourth of the group. The two first sets went on similarly, with the South Africans breaking twice in the first to win it 6–2, and the Americans doing the same in the second to level the score. Coetzee and Moodie managed to take the close deciding tie-break, improving their head-to-head against the Bryans to 2–2 by scoring a 6–2, 2–6, [12–10], victory over them. The second, crucial match, for a semifinal spot, saw Pablo Cuevas and Luis Horna face for the first time Mark Knowles (defending champion) and Mahesh Bhupathi (three-time runner-up). Both teams served strongly, converting none of their breaks points in the first set, and providing none in the second. Bhupathi and Knowles took the first tie-break 7–3, Cuevas and Horna the second 7–4, before the latter extended their second set domination to a 6–7, 7–6, [10–5] victory, eliminating Bhupathi and Knowles, and setting a semifinal clash with Nestor and Zimonjić –which they had beaten in the French Open final.\nThe last two matches of the singles' Gold Group took place, with the first, also a dead rubber, opposing Novak Djokovic (already qualified) to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga (already eliminated) for the third time since the Serb won their Australian Open final. Djokovic easily raced through the first set, breaking Tsonga twice to a 6–1 win. The second set was closer, as both players were holding their service games until 5–6, when Djokovic, serving for a tie-break, found himself led, then broken by Tsonga, who levelled the match to one-set-all. In the final set, Tsonga increased his game level breaking Djokovic twice to win the last set, ending the match on the score of 1–6, 7–5, 6–1, to improve his head-to-head record against the Serb to 3–1, and score his first career Masters Cup win. The second match, set to decide of the third semifinalist after Djokovic and Murray, was the third career meeting of Nikolay Davydenko and Juan Martín del Potro. The Russian broke del Potro early in the first set, leading 4–1 at a point, when the Argentinian took back Davydenko's serve, seemingly getting back into the match. The fourth seed, though, did not let del Potro complete his comeback, and broke him again, eventually taking the set 6–4. Davydenko's momentum took him through the second set, where he converted each of the two break points obtained, to close the match 6–4, 6–2 after less than an-hour and a half of play. The result eliminated del Potro, and allowed Davydenko to qualify for his second semifinal in four season-ending events appearances, after 2005.\nDay 6.\nIn the first of the last two doubles round robin matches, within the Gold Group, on November 14, Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić, already qualified to meet Cuevas and Horna in the semifinals, faced already eliminated Lukáš Dlouhý and Leander Paes, in a dead rubber. The second seeds did not leave many opportunities to the US Open runners-up Dlouhý and Paes, breaking them twice in the first, and once in the second set, saving all break points against themselves, to cruise to a 6–1, 6–4 win, and leave the round-robin stage as the only undefeated team. In the second match –to decide of the last doubles qualifiers–, Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski defeated Jonas Björkman and Kevin Ullyett, to enter the last four, setting a semifinal meeting with Bob and Mike Bryan. The first two sets were each dominated by one of the teams, with the Poles breaking twice to win the first, and Björkman and Ullyett doing the same to win the second, before Fyrstenberg and Matkowski eventually took the advantage in the deciding match tie-break, to score a 6–2, 1–6, [10–6] victory, and complete the semifinals line up.\nBjörkman and Ullyett's loss to Fyrstenberg and Matkowski marked the last career match of the Swede Jonas Björkman, who had announced his retirement at the end of the year, after a seventeen-year career, started in 1991, at the Swedish Open in Båstad. In singles, Björkman won six career titles, and went as high as the 4th place in the rankings, in 1997, reaching two Grand Slam semifinals at the 1997 US Open (lost to Rusedski), and at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships (lost to Federer). A former World No. 1 in doubles, Björkman won fifty-four career doubles titles, including nine Grand Slam crowns (runner-up at six more). He was one of four active doubles players at the time of the Masters Cup to have completed a career Grand Slam (with Bob and Mike Bryan, and Daniel Nestor), and two year-end championships titles, in 1994 and 2006. Björkman, who mainly partnered during his career with Jan Apell, Nicklas Kulti, Todd Woodbridge, Max Mirnyi and Kevin Ullyett, also finished runner-up at two mixed doubles Grand Slam finals at Wimbledon, with Anna Kournikova in 1999, and Alicia Molik in 2007, and was part of the Sweden Davis Cup team for their last three championships in 1994, 1997 and 1998. Upon retirement, as a ceremony was taking place for him, following his loss to Fyrstenberg and Matkowski, Björkman declared: \"We were hoping to maybe get through [to the semifinals]. I still think it's great to end my career in the biggest event of the year. But you can't get everything. I've been mentally prepared for this because I'm mentally very ready to retire. [...] I've been very fortunate to be able to play for so long. It started as my hobby, and I've been able to do it for seventeen years, which is great. I'm really looking forward for the next step in life.\"\nThe final round robin matches first opposed, in singles, Gilles Simon to Radek Štěpánek. Despite them having nothing to gain from a win (Štěpánek was already eliminated, and only the last match would determine Simon's fate), the Frenchman took the opportunity to avenge a French Open first round loss to the Czech, breaking him twice in the first set, once in the second, to clinch a 6–1, 6–4 victory. Andy Murray then faced Roger Federer in a match to decide of the Red Group's standings –a Murray win giving him the first place, Simon the second, a Federer win making him first, Murray second. Federer first took Murray's serve to lead 3–1, but the Briton broke back, and it took a second break by the Swiss at 5–4 to take the set. Murray was quick, with two breaks of serve, to race to a 5–2 second set lead, and was serving when Federer lined up four games to get back into the set, forcing a tie-break –which Murray eventually won, 7–3. Murray seemed to have grasp of the match at 3–0 in the third, with Federer, already diminished by an illness, calling the trainer for the back injury that had forced him out from the Paris Masters, but the Swiss fought back again, winning four straight games to lead 4–3. Unable to retain his advantage, Federer found himself led 4–5, saving seven match points on his ten-deuce-serve, before being broken, at 5–6, allowing Murray to reach the semis (vs. Davydenko) undefeated, with a 4–6, 7–6, 7–5 win, and giving Simon a semifinal spot (vs. Djokovic). Federer made his earliest exit to the tournament since 2002, when he went out in the semifinals (lost to Hewitt).\nDay 7.\nThe semifinals of the Masters Cup, now in a knockout stage, took place on November 15, first opposing doubles Gold Group winners, ATP No. 2 Daniel Nestor (2007 champion, 1998 and 2006 runner-up) and Nenad Zimonjić (2005 finalist), undefeated in the event, to Red Group seconds Pablo Cuevas and Luis Horna (in their first year-end event appearance). The two teams had only met once before this match, in the French Open final, where the South Americans had upset the Canadian-Serbian pair, defeating them 6–2, 6–3 in less than an hour to win their first Grand Slam title. Nestor and Zimonjić eased through the Roland-Garros rematch, providing no break opportunities on their serve, but taking their opponents' four times, to score a 6–1, 6–3 victory in less than an hour and a half, and qualify for their first final together. Red Group top pair and current World No. 1 Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan next faced Gold Group seconds, Erlich and Ram's substitutes Mariusz Fyrstenberg and Marcin Matkowski. The semifinal was preceded by a five-match history, with the Bryans leading the head-to-head 4–1, having played in 2004 in Acapulco (won by Bryan/Bryan), in 2007 in Madrid (won by Bryan/Bryan), and in 2008 in Barcelona (won by Bryan/Bryan), Cincinnati (won by Bryan/Bryan), and Paris (won by Fyrstenberg/Matkowski). Bob and Mike Bryan dominated the encounter, serving strongly throughout the meeting, and breaking once in each set, to clinch, after little more than an hour, a 6–4, 6–4 victory, and reach their third final at the year-end event after winning their two previous ones in 2003 and 2004. Qualifying for the final, Nestor and Zimonjić, and Bob and Mike Bryan, separated by a mere sixty-three points in the Race rankings, set a match to decide of the year-end No. 1 spot.\nThe singles semifinals saw first facing Novak Djokovic and Gilles Simon, both in their first semifinal appearances at the year-end event. The two's only previous meeting was then a second round in Marseille, in Djokovic's first tournament after his Australian Open win, where the Frenchman had taken the advantage in three sets 6–2, 6–7, 6–3. Simon was once again the first to take the lead in their second encounter, in Shanghai, returning and serving slightly better than his opponent, to snatch the first set 6–4. After calling the trainer to nurse a neck pain at the start of the second set, Simon failed to hold his serve to be led 1–3 by the Serb, who then maintained his break to the end of the 6–3 set. Djokovic took the chance to break at 1–1 in the third, leading 5–4, when, after taking a time out for cramp, the Serb served for the match, and Simon managed to break back to 5–5. The fatigue of the nearly three hours match, though, proved too strong for the Frenchman, who lost his serve at 6–5, allowing Djokovic to finish the match on the score of 4–6, 6–3, 7–5, and reach his first year-end championships final. Andy Murray, victor of Federer in a three-hours match on the previous day, faced Nikolay Davydenko, in his second semifinal showing at the Masters Cup, after 2005, when he lost to David Nalbandian in straight sets. The Murray-Davydenko match was preceded by six previous meetings, split between the two players, in 2006 in Indian Wells (won by Davydenko) and at the US Open (won by Davydenko), in 2007 in Doha (won by Murray) and Indian Wells (won by Murray), and in 2008 in Doha (won by Murray) and Dubai (won by Davydenko). Davydenko broke in the first game, only to be immediately broken back by Murray, but the Russian, who had not played since his last round robin match two days before, proved himself fresher in the course of the game, and was able to take Murray's serve a second time at 5–5, keeping his following service game to score a 7–5 win in the first set. Davydenko capitalized on his momentum to line up five straight games in the second set from 1–2 to 6–2, clinching his 7–5, 6–2 win over Murray in little more than an hour and a half, to reach his fifth final of the season, and his first at the Masters Cup.\nDay 8.\nThe first final to take place on November 16, was that of the doubles event, taking place between World No. 1s, US Open, Miami, Rome and Cincinnati Masters, Barcelona champion Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan, and World No. 2s, Wimbledon, Hamburg and Toronto Masters, London Queen's Club titlists Daniel Nestor and Nenad Zimonjić, in a match to decide of the year-end No. 1 ranking. It was the third year-end event final of the Bryans, after 2003 (def. Llodra/Santoro) and 2004 (def. Black/Ullyett), the fourth of Daniel Nestor, after three finals with Mark Knowles, in 1998 (lost to Eltingh/Haarhuis), 2006 (lost to Björkman/Mirnyi), and 2007 (def. Aspelin/Knowle), and the second of Nenad Zimonjić after a previous final in 2005 with Leander Paes (lost to Llodra/Santoro). The two teams also shared a four-match history before the final, having played together in four ATP Masters Series finals, in 2007 in Paris (won by Bryan/Bryan), and in 2008 in Rome (won by Bryan/Bryan), Hamburg (won by Nestor/Zimonjić), Toronto (won by Nestor/Zimonjić). The Canadian-Serbian duo took the upper hand early in the match, breaking the Americans to lead in the first set, until the Bryans broke back to level the score –both teams then held their serve to a tie-break, in which Nestor and Zimonjić prevailed, 7–3. The second seeds raced through the next set, converting their two break points to notch a 7–6, 6–2 win –their fifth title of the year, and their first at the year-end championships. The win also meant a first year-end No. 1 spot together for the undefeated champions Nestor and Zimonjić (Zimonjić's first ever, Nestor's third, after ending No. 1 in 2002 and 2004 with Knowles) and, in the individual rankings for doubles players, the top spot for Zimonjić, and the second for Nestor.\nThe Tennis Masters Cup singles final featured ATP No. 3, Australian Open, Indian Wells and Rome champion Novak Djokovic, and Miami Masters, Pörtschach and Warsaw winner Nikolay Davydenko, in both men's first year-end championships final. The encounter was the third match of the two, after a Davis Cup rubber won by Davydenko after Djokovic retired, leading two sets to one, and their round robin meeting on day 3, in which Djokovic prevailed 7–6, 0–6, 7–5. Djokovic started the encounter on serve, and took the advantage of a weak Davydenko service game (the Russian went on to win only 42% of his service points in the set) to break and lead 2–0. A nervous Davydenko failed again to keep his serve at 3–0, and was broken again by the Serb. The Russian managed to save his service game at 5–0, forcing Djokovic to serve for the set. The Serb did not falter, and clinched the set 6–1. Despite holding his first service game, Davydenko was broken again at 1–1 in the second set. Davydenko avoided another break of serve when led 1–3, but was unable to gain the advantage on Djokovic's serve until the Serb served for the match at 5–4. Davydenko then increased his level of play, and came back to 5-all, but Djokovic, keeping his momentum of the match, broke once more, and held to serve to claim victory, after one hour and forty-two minutes, on the final score of 6–1, 7–5. The win marked Djokovic's fourth title of the year (after a six months title drought since Rome, won on May 11) and his eleventh overall, as well as his first year-end championships crown. Djokovic became the first Serbian player to win the singles championships (Nenad Zimonjić had become the first Serbian to win the doubles championships just hours before – and all three men, Djokovic, Zimonjić and Nestor were born in Belgrade), succeeding to two-time defending champion Roger Federer, and, thanks to the win, and Federer's early loss, finished the year only two points behind the Swiss in the ATP Race. Djokovic commented on his win : \"I would put it in the same league as a Grand Slam because the best eight players in the world are participating here. [...] I feel very happy. End up the season the way I started it, with a win in a big event. So it's a great boost up for upcoming season.\" On the possibility of going up in the rankings in the 2009 ATP World Tour season, Djokovic admitted again his goal to become World No. 1 : \"Certainly, I believe that I have quality to reach the top spot in the upcoming year or, you know, whatever, next couple of years, 10 years [...] That is my lifetime goal that I’ve been always trying to achieve.\""

        "text": "Úrvalsdeild karla (English: Men's Premier League), also known as Subway deildin for sponsorship reasons, is the highest men's professional basketball competition among clubs in Iceland, where play determines the national champion. It is organized by the Icelandic Basketball Federation ().\nThe season consists of a home-and-away schedule of 22 games, followed by an eight-team playoff round. Quarterfinals, semifinals and finals series are best-of-five. The bottom clubs are relegated, and replaced by the top team from the regular-season phase and the four-team playoff round winner of the second-level First Division ().\nHistory.\nCreation and first years 1951-1959.\nThe league was founded in 1951 as \"1. deild karla\" () and its first season was played in April 1952 with five teams, Íþróttafélag Keflavíkurflugvallar (ÍKF), Íþróttafélag Reykjavíkur (ÍR), Íþróttafélag Stúdenta (ÍS), Gosi and Glímufélagið Ármann, participating. The team of ÍKF had the advantage of its close proximity with the US Naval Air Station at Keflavík International Airport and therefore could play competitive games with American players who had high school and college experience. They were furthermore coached by two American naval personnel, Gene Crowley and John Wahl. During the tournament, ÍKF won all four of its games with an average of 10.8 points.\nFor the first years decade the league was dominated by ÍKF (with 4 wins) and ÍR (with 3 wins); with ÍS finally breaking their dominance in 1959.\nÍR's dominance and the arrival of the Americans 1960-1980.\nFrom 1960 to 1964, ÍR, under the leadership of Helgi Jóhannsson, won five straight championships followed by KR winning four straight. From 1969 to 1977, ÍR added seven championships in 9 years. Its last victory in 1977 marked an end of an era and the rise of the Suðurnes rivals Keflavík and Njarðvík.\nIn September 1975, Jimmy Rogers became the first foreign born professional basketball player in Iceland when he signed a three-month contract with Ármann in preparations for their games against Honka Playboys in the FIBA European Cup Winners' Cup. Shortly later, KR signed fellow American Curtis Carter who immediately caught the attention of the fans and media with his powerful play and dunks. Together, they were credited for revolutionizing the Icelandic basketball scene. More Americans followed, including Rick Hockenos, Tim Dwyer and Danny Shouse.\nNjarðvík's leadership.\nThe next two decades, exactly from 1980–81 season to the 1997–98 season, Njarðvík (known as ÍKF until 1969) lead the league with 10 wins. In the same period, Keflavík won 4 titles and the KR won their eighth title.\nModern era.\nFrom the 2000–01 season, many teams have divided the lead of the league.

        "title": "Carrera (cycling team)",
        "text": "Carrera was an Italian-based road bicycle racing team active from 1984 to 1996, named after sponsoring Italian jeans manufacturer Carrera. The team was successful in the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France with three overall wins and several wins in the Points classification and Mountain Classifications.\nHistory.\nInoxpran.\nThe Inoxpran cycling team began in 1979. The Inoxpran team achieved success with Italian Giovanni Battaglin who won in the period of a month and a half in 1981 two Grand Tours in with the 1981 Giro d'Italia and the 1981 Vuelta a España. Battaglin was the second rider in history to achieve this Giro-Vuelta double after Eddy Merckx who achieved the double in 1973. Roberto Visentini had been the Inoxpran team leader in 1983 when he finished second overall in the 1983 Giro d'Italia.\nCarrera.\nCarrera Jeans became the title sponsor in 1984 and Visentini finally won the Giro d'Italia in 1986. At the end of 1985 the team had signed Stephen Roche to perform for the team at the Tour de France. Roche had a poor season in 1986 but bounced back in 1987. When Roche won the Tour de Romandie just ahead of the 1987 Giro d'Italia, he became the number one favourite for the maglia rosa and wanted to be the team leader during the race, something that Visentini, an Italian with an Italian team and the defending champion of the event expected to be alone. This inter team rivalry came to a head during the race when Roche attacked Visentini. Roche went on to win the race and then the 1987 Tour de France. This was the only time that the Carrera team would win the Tour and it would be the last time the team won the Giro d'Italia. Roche left the team at the end of 1987 but returned to the team in 1992 for his last two seasons.\nIn 1989, Carrera manager Davide Boifava together with Luciano Bracchi, Francesco Boifava, Tacchella's family and Valentino Compagnoni founded \"Carrera Podium\", a manufacturer of cycles. From 1990 on, the team rode on these Carrera bikes.\nDuring this time, Claudio Chiappucci rose from being the domestique of Visentini and Roche during the 1987 Giro to the team leader. Chiappucci wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification during the 1990 Tour de France finishing the race second overall and famously battled Miguel Indurain in the 1992 Tour de France. Chiappucci won the Great Italian Classic Milan–San Remo for the team in 1991.\nDuring the latter years of the team, a young Marco Pantani emerged as a contender for the Grand Tours during the 1994 season finishing on the podium in both the 1994 Giro d'Italia and the 1994 Tour de France. Pantani's success was hindered during the last two years of the Carrera team's existence. When Carrera stopped sponsoring a cycling team at the end of 1996, it was reported that manager Davide Boifava would be building a team around Marco Pantani with Mercatone Uno as the main sponsor. However Davide Cassani became the manager of that new team, taking with him as directeur sportifs Giuseppe Martinelli and Alessandro Giannelli and ten of the riders from Carrera including Pantani forming the team with whom Pantani would win the 1998 Tour de France and the 1998 Giro d'Italia. At the same time, Boifava started a team with Asics as the main sponsor and took with him five riders from Carrera including Claudio Chiappucci.\nDoping.\nThe team doctor of the Carrera cycling team, Dr. Giovanni Grazzi, worked with Professor Francesco Conconi at the University of Ferrara in 1993. It was reported in the Rome-based newspaper, La Republica, in January 2000 that Conconi was involved with administering EPO to riders on the Carrera team. In March 2000 the Italian Judge Franca Oliva published a report detailing the conclusions of an investigation into a number of sports doctors including Professor Conconi. This official judicial investigation concluded that the riders of the Carrera team were administered EPO in 1993. The riders included Stephen Roche, Claudio Chiappucci, Guido Bontempi, Rolf Sørensen, Mario Chiesa, Massimo Ghirotto and Fabio Roscioli.\nFiles seized as part of the judicial investigation allegedly detail a number of aliases for former Tour de France, Giro d'Italia winner and World Champion Stephen Roche including Rocchi, Rossi, Rocca, Roncati, Righi and Rossini. In 1997, Claudio Chiappucci told prosecutor Vincenzo Scolastico that he had been using EPO since 1993, but later he recalled that statement.\nSupplementary statistics.\nSources"

He was an AFL All-Star in 1961, and was with the Oilers in the first three AFL Championship games, winning the title in 1960 and 1961.\nA native of Sycamore, Illinois, he played college football for the Northwestern Wildcats from 1957 to 1959. In his final season in 1959, coach Ara Parseghian led the Wildcats to 6-0 record and were nationally ranked, defeating Oklahoma, Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Notre Dame and Indiana, before dropping their last three games to go 6–3.\nUnclaimed in the 1960 NFL Draft, Johnston went on to have 14 interceptions in his pro career.\nHe and the Oilers won the first AFL championship game on New Year's Day, 1961 over the San Diego Chargers, 24-16 before a crowd of 32,183 in Houston, Texas, led by quarterback George Blanda and flanker Billy Cannon, who hooked up on an 88-yard touchdown pass. Later that same year, on Christmas Eve, the same two teams met for the 1961 AFL championship before a crowd of 29,556 in San Diego, where the Oilers prevailed 10–3. That game's only touchdown came in the third quarter on a 35-yard pass from Blanda to Cannon.\nGoing for three championships in a row, the Oilers ended up losing to the Dallas Texans (who next year became the Kansas City Chiefs) in the longest title game in American pro football history. It took two overtime periods in Houston before the Texans came away with a 20–17 victory on a 25-yard field goal by Tommy Brooker.\nJohnston then concluded his pro career with the New York Jets and Oakland Raiders in 1964."

        "text": "William Alex Hudson (July 9, 1935 – December 13, 2017) was an American football defensive tackle and unheralded member of the original Fearsome Foursome of defensive linemen in pro football. He attended Clemson University, where he was a member of the track and football teams. He played professionally in the Canadian Football League with the Montreal Alouettes and in the American Football League with the San Diego Chargers and the Boston Patriots. He is a member of the South Carolina Sports Hall of Fame. \nHudson was the younger brother of Bob Hudson, who also attended Clemson and spent 10 seasons (1951-55, 1957-61) in the NFL and AFL as a linebacker and defensive back. \n'Fearsome' legacy.\nHudson was drafted by the cash-strapped Chicago Cardinals in the 1957 NFL draft, but he signed for more money with the Alouettes of the Canadian Football League instead. He played with the Alouettes for three seasons and often both ways as an offensive and defensive tackle. Chargers assistant coach Al Davis learned that Hudson was unhappy with his situation and convinced him to jump to the new American League Football League.\nHudson was the captain of the Chargers defense in the 1961 and 1962 seasons, when he teamed with tackle Ernie Ladd and ends Earl Faison and Ron Nery on the most physically dominant line in the AFL if not all of pro football. The group soon became known as the Fearsome Foursome -- they were even celebrated in “The Fearsome Foursome Stomp\" musical recording -- although their Los Angeles Rams counterparts in the more established NFL would gain more notoriety with the same monicker only years later. \n“About 10 years ago, (ex-Chargers assistant coach) Chuck Noll made the comment in Sports Illustrated when asked if his Pittsburgh Steelers line (the legendary Steel Curtain) was the best he'd ever had. And he said, no, the Chargers line was the best.” Hudson told the Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald-Journal in a 2009 interview. “We were the largest defensive line in the history of football at that time. And back in those days, we lied about our weight down, where now players lie up about their weight.” \nWhile the 6-foot-4, 270-pound Hudson was a run-stopper first and foremost, he possessed the savvy and physical strength to be an effective pass-rusher as well. In 1961, his AFL debut, he had four sacks and one interception that was returned for a touchdown. In large part because of the Fearsome Foursome and their unmerciful treatment of quarterbacks, the Chargers intercepted a league record 49 passes en route to the division title. Hudson and Faison were selected to the West Division All-Star team that season.\nHudson was traded to the Patriots after the 1962 campaign. He saw action in four games with them before retirement as a player. He went on to spend 17 years as an area scout for Al Davis after the Chargers assistant coach left the team to become the Oakland Raiders head man. \nHudson died on December 13, 2017, at a medical center in Spartanburg, South Carolina, at the age of 82. He was survived by his wife of 59 years, Lillian, three children, six grandchildren and two brothers."

        "title": "2007 World Series of Poker Europe",
        "text": "The World Series of Poker Europe (WSOPE) is the first expansion effort of World Series of Poker-branded poker tournaments outside the United States. Since 1970, participants have had to travel to Las Vegas if they wanted to compete in the World Series of Poker (WSOP). Although the WSOP held circuit events in other locations, the main tournaments, which awarded bracelets to the winners, were exclusively held in Las Vegas. The inaugural WSOPE, held in 2007, marked the first time that a WSOP bracelet was awarded outside Las Vegas.\nIn 2004, Harrah's Casinos purchased the rights to the WSOP label. Harrah's later purchased London Clubs International (LCI). LCI operates three casinos in the London area: Fifty, Leicester Square, and The Sportsman. After the purchase of these casinos, Harrah's decided to expand its WSOP label into Europe. European casinos typically have a different environment than those in the U.S. Jeffrey Pollack, the WSOP Commissioner, indicated that the WSOPE would have a \"style and flair that is both unique and appropriate to the setting. So don't be surprised if we require participants to wear blazers at the tables. If James Bond were hosting a poker tournament it may look like the World Series of Poker Europe.\"\nIn marketing the WSOPE, Harrah's Casino did not rely upon the reputation of Harrah's or the WSOP alone. On 5 July 2007, Harrah's announced its alliance with England-based Betfair, one of the largest online gaming companies in the world. The agreement builds on Betfair's European reputation in advertising the WSOPE while creating the largest agreement between a web-based and brick-and-mortar casinos. Due to changes in U.S. laws, effective in 2007, the WSOP could no longer accept money from online gambling companies. This prevented the WSOP from acknowledging WSOP qualifiers from online events. The WSOPE is not bound by this limitation. The United Kingdom Gambling Act of 2005 allows for legal regulated online poker sites. Furthermore, as the laws that govern the age of gambling differ in England than the U.S., the WSOPE admits younger players. In 2007, four of the five finalists at the first event of the WSOPE had won bracelets. Thomas Bihl, however, outlasted each of them to claim the first-ever WSOPE bracelet. No previous bracelet winners played at the second final table; Dario Alioto won the bracelet. Annette \"Annette_15\" Obrestad, became the youngest player to win a WSOP bracelet event at 18 years and 364 days old in the final event of the tournament. As of 2016, Obrestad's record still stands.\nReferences.\n "

His club career was spent with the Illawarra Steelers, Easts, Parramatta, Auckland and Wests Tigers. Of Indigenous Australian descent, Simon also represented Australia and New South Wales in Origin.\nHis brother, Craig Simon, also was a professional rugby league player.\nPlaying career.\nA Port Kembla local and Dapto junior, Simon made his first grade debut with the Steelers aged 17 and went on to make 120 appearances for the club between 1990 and 1995. He received the BHP Medal as the Illawarra Steelers' player of the year in 1994.\nIn 1996 Simon moved to the Sydney City Roosters but was unable to dislodge Adrian Lam from the first grade half spot and he moved to Parramatta for three seasons from 1997 to 1999.\nIn the 1998 preliminary final against Canterbury, Parramatta were ahead 18-2 with less than 10 minutes to play. After Canterbury scored a try to make it 18-6, Simon had two chances of a field goal that would have given Parramatta the victory but missed both attempts. After missing the second attempt, Simon was substituted off the field by a frustrated Brian Smith. Canterbury went on to win the game 32-20 in extra time.\nHis apparent lack of fitness found him out of favor with coach Brian Smith and midway through 1999 he gained another release to play for Auckland (he was named captain in his second match with the club).\nAfter two seasons with the Warriors, Simon moved to the Wests Tigers where, despite some good performances for the club, he announced his retirement before the end of the 2001 season citing a lack of enthusiasm. The Tigers had been beaten 64-0 by Melbourne that weekend.\nIn 2003 Simon was named in the commemorative Illawarra \"Team of Steel\" celebrating players from 25 years of the club's history.\nRepresentative career.\nHe was selected at half-back for City Firsts in 1991 and 1992 and in game I of the 1992 State of Origin was picked in the run-on side when Ricky Stuart was unavailable due to injury. The Blues won the match but Stuart regained his spot for game II.\nIt would be another five years before Simon would again wear the Blues' jumper. During the 1997 season, split at both club and representative level due to the Super League war, Simon appeared in all three games, once at half and twice off the interchange bench. Simon was the Blues' hero in game II, landing a 26-metre field goal in the 67th minute that clinched New South Wales' 1 point win.\nIn 1997, Simon made his sole national representative appearance, selected for Australia in the one-off Test against a Rest-of-the-World side at Suncorp Stadium.\nPost-career.\nAfter retiring, Simon worked in Aboriginal Education, before buying a Subway in Kiama in 1997. He coached at a local level, including the Illawarra Titans in a Koori knockout competition."

Howard played primarily tight end, the position at which he had been an all-conference high school player, and his signing is considered a prime example of the innovative personnel decisions the Cowboys were renowned for at the time.\nIn his two years with the team he earned the nickname \"Dr. W.\" for his hitting as the wedge buster in the special teams unit. In Super Bowl X, he played a quarter in place of injured starter Jean Fugett and also forced a fumble with a hit on Donnie Shell.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nThe Seattle Seahawks selected him from the Cowboys roster in the 1976 NFL Expansion Draft. He became the first starting tight end in franchise history, posting 37 receptions (second on the team) for 422 yards (third on the team).\nHis 37 receptions in 1976 was a team record for tight ends that lasted 26 years until it was broken by Itula Mili in 2002.

        "text": "John Alfred Roper (born October 4, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a linebacker in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago Bears, Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles. He played college football for the Texas A&amp;M Aggies, earning consensus All-American honors in 1987. Roper was selected in the second round of the 1989 NFL Draft. He was on the Cowboys' Super Bowl XXVIII championship team that beat the Buffalo Bills.\nEarly years.\nAt Texas A&amp;M University, Roper was one of the best to play defensively in school history according to his coach, Jackie Sherrill.\nIn 1987, he was the Southwest Conference Defensive Player of the Year, as well as an All-American. In his four years as an Aggie, they compiled a record of 36 wins and just 12 losses: three conference championships; and twice they were victorious in the Cotton Bowl.\nRoper, a two-time All-Southwest Conference and a consensus All-American, was at the heart of that success. Before heading to the NFL, he began a tradition that became known all across college football. It was during his career the famed moniker of the “Wrecking Crew” was born.\nHis career tackles for a loss of 68 while at Texas A&amp;M ranked him 8th in the NCAA at the conclusion of his college football career (currently ranks 14th). In addition, his career sack total of 36 ranked him 9th in the NCAA at the conclusion of his college football career (currently ranks 24th).\nHe is one of the greatest linebackers in Texas A&amp;M University history and was inducted into the Texas A&amp;M Athletic Hall of Fame in 2009.\nProfessional career.\nChicago Bears.\nRoper was drafted in the second round (36th overall) of the 1989 NFL Draft by the Chicago Bears.\nHis best season came in 1991, when started all 16 games at right outside linebacker, finishing with 90 tackles and 8 sacks (second on the team). A pulled hamstring in the season finale at San Francisco forced him to miss the playoff loss against the Dallas Cowboys. He was also voted NFC player of the week, after registering 11 tackles, 2 sacks and one pass defensed in a 21–20 win against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The next year, although he started 13 games, his sack production dropped to 2.5 sacks.\nIn 1993, former Dallas Cowboys defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt became the new head coach for the Chicago Bears and implemented a 4–3 defense where Roper and other linebackers already in the roster were no longer a good fit. He was eventually traded to the Cowboys along with tight end Kelly Blackwell and safety Markus Paul, in exchange for linebacker Vinson Smith, Barry Minter and a sixth-round draft pick in the 1995 NFL Draft.\nDallas Cowboys.\nIt has been mentioned that Dallas Cowboys head coach Jimmy Johnson accepted the trade to help close friend Dave Wannstedt in his new job, with all of the players received eventually being waived.\nRoper didn't fit the Cowboys 4–3 defense either, which was the same system that was being implemented in Chicago. He recorded 3 tackles and 2 sacks in three games with the team, playing mainly on special teams.\nIn Cowboys lore, Roper is known for being cut by Johnson, in order to send the team a message, after he fell asleep during a special teams meeting prior to their October 17 game against the San Francisco 49ers in 1993.\nPhiladelphia Eagles.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles after previously in the year trying twice to trade for Roper, signed him as a free agent on November 17, 1993. He was waived in a salary cap move on June 3, 1994."

        "text": "The President of the LSD Golf Club is the sixth studio album by the Belgian band Hooverphonic. The title was originally intended for \"The Magnificent Tree\", but was not allowed by Sony, Hooverphonic's label at the time.\nThe album has quite a different feel from previous Hooverphonic albums. The album was recorded with live musicians and made use of the mellotron, an electronic keyboard popularised by The Beatles' \"Strawberry Fields Forever\"\"\". The sound of the album harks back to the psychedelic era of music but retains a sense of modernity. Songs such as \"Expedition Impossible\" also have more of a traditional rock sound, compared to the sound of earlier Hooverphonic work.\nCritics were divided on the album, some claiming it grounded Hooverphonic after the mystery of \"The Magnificent Tree\", while others claimed that it was the most \"daring and experimental Hooverphonic album\" yet.\nIn some countries (like France, Italy, Sweden and Spain), and on iTunes, the album received a special edition release which included \"The Perfect Dose\".\nSingles.\nThe first single from the album was \"Expedition Impossible\" with the B-sides \"Pink Flamingo Dream\" and \"August\". It was released in September 2007 in the Netherlands and Belgium and January 2008 worldwide. It was also the first Hooverphonic single to get an international release on iTunes. In 2012, the song was re-recorded with vocals by Noémie Wolfs for inclusion on the orchestral album \"With Orchestra\". It is also the only song from \"The President of the LSD Golf Club\" to feature on \"The Best of Hooverphonic\" compilation in 2016.\nThe second single was announced in late October 2007 as \"Gentle Storm\". The B-side to the single, \"The Perfect Dose\", was also released on iTunes as a download single and on the special edition of the album in select countries.\nThe third single \"Circles\" was released in February 2008. The song was remixed for the single release and included the b-side \"Cry\", a cover of a song by Godley &amp; Creme, released in 1985.\nThe song \"50 Watt\" was released as a radio-only single in Belgium in early 2008 along with a cover of Nirvana's \"In Bloom\".\nTrack listing.\nAll songs written by Alex Callier\nB-sides and covers:"

        "title": "Great Britain national baseball team",
        "text": "The Great Britain national baseball team is the national men's baseball team of the United Kingdom. It is governed by the British Baseball Federation, and is also a member nation of the Confederation of European Baseball.\nHistory.\nThe British team, managed by George McNeil, won the inaugural Baseball World Cup in 1938, beating the United States by four games to one in the series hosted in England. This series was subsequently declared the first world championship of amateur baseball by the International Baseball Federation, and so Great Britain became the first amateur world champions. With the backing of Sir John Moores a team was set to compete in the 1939 series, in Havana, as defending champions. In doing so they would have become the first national representative team to compete outside of the United Kingdom but the outbreak of the Second World War interrupted the development of baseball in the United Kingdom, the team withdrew and the sport entered into decline domestically. So severe was the impact of the Second World War on baseball in the United Kingdom that it was over 70 years before the team qualified for another world championship event, when they reached the 2009 Baseball World Cup by virtue of its second-place finish at the 2007 European Baseball Championship.\nIn 2007, the Great Britain team won the silver medal at the European Baseball Championship, finishing top of Group B and only losing two games in the tournament. It ultimately finished second overall to the Netherlands. This marked Britain's highest placing in the tournament since its first entry into the event in 1967, when it also finished second.\nPrior to 2007 the team's showing in the European Baseball Championship was generally limited to finishing in the lower half of the standings, which often resulted in relegation to the secondary tournament known as the European Baseball Championship Qualifier (sometimes referred to as the 'B-Pool'). In 1988 and 1996 Great Britain hosted and won the Qualifier, thereby returning to the main European Championship event the following year (sometimes referred to as the 'A-Pool'). Since the silver medal in 2007, Great Britain has on occasion had to repeat the process of qualification through the B-Pool.\nBy winning the silver medal in 2007 Great Britain qualified both for the 2009 Baseball World Cup and for the Final Qualifying Tournament in Taiwan for the 2008 Summer Olympics. However, a lack of funding including a refusal by UK Sport to provide any backing meant it was forced to withdraw from the Final Qualifying Tournament and was replaced by Germany. This was the Great Britain team's last chance to qualify for an Olympic baseball competition due to the earlier decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to remove baseball from the Games after 2008. That decision – announced one day after London had been awarded the 2012 Olympics on 6 July 2005 – also meant that the Great Britain baseball team would not have the opportunity to play in front of a home crowd in the 2012 London Olympics and to promote the sport in the United Kingdom. It also meant that the team ceased to receive elite funding from bodies such as UK Sport.\nAt the 2009 World Cup – held simultaneously in various countries around Europe – Britain qualified out of the first group stage before eventually finishing 15th overall. Following the World Cup, in October 2009 the IBAF announced a new set of world rankings in which Britain rose to 21st., though they since dropped to 32nd as of 2017.\nGreat Britain was invited to compete in the qualifying round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic. In 2016 Hall of Fame inductee Trevor Hoffman joined the coaching staff, honouring his maternal English ancestry, with his grandfather having been a professional footballer in the Football League. Great Britain competed in the qualifying round of the 2017 World Baseball Classic, where it was defeated in the finals by Team Israel.\nOn September 20, 2022, Great Britain qualified for its first World Baseball Classic by defeating Spain 10–9 in 10 innings in Regensburg, Germany. \nNotable figures.\nHall of Fame inductee Trevor Hoffman has previously coached the Great Britain national team, as has the English-born, highly experienced Major League Baseball player Lance Painter. The most high-profile recent player to represent the United Kingdom as a player is Jazz Chisholm Jr. Former major leaguer Vance Worley has also played for the team, starting the qualifying game against Spain in 2022 that clinched a spot in the 2023 World Baseball Classic.\nCurrent roster.\nThe team’s roster for the 2023 World Baseball Classic qualification. Very few members of the team were born in Britain, instead qualifying through British parents or grandparents, and almost none of them played in the domestic league.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of professional baseball match results currently active in the latest version of the WBSC World Rankings, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nTournament record.\nWorld Baseball Classic.\nGreat Britain was invited to compete in the qualifying round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic, where they were grouped Canada and Germany. After an 11–1 defeat to the Canadians, they won against the Czech Republic, 12–5. In the third group game, however, Great Britain lost to Germany. 16–0 down at the 7th inning stretch, they pulled one back before the mercy rule came into effect, and GB exited the qualifiers 16–1.\nEuropean Baseball Championship.\nTeam Great Britain have played in 17 tournaments, with a current unbroken streak going back to 1997. The best result a silver medal (1967 and 2007).\nNotable among these appearances was 2019, with former MLB pitchers Barry Enright and Michael Roth playing for the team."

Foster (March 18, 1946 – October 4, 1985) was an American professional basketball player.\nEarly life.\nFoster grew up in Springfield, Ohio, and attended Springfield South High School.\nCollege career.\nFoster played as a 6'5\" forward at Miami University. After averaging only 3.4 points per game as a sophomore, as a junior he exploded for 21.3 points and 10.1 rebounds per game and was named first-team All-Mid-American Conference. In his senior season of 1967–68, he earned the first-ever Mid-American Conference Player of the Year award and set a school record that still stands—the all-time single-season points-per-game average with 26.9 in 1967–68, ahead of the 24.9 of basketball hall-of-famer Wayne Embry and NBA world champion Ron Harper. His single-game high was 43 points against Ball State University on December 2, 1967. Foster also averaged 12.5 rebounds per game that year, sixth in Miami history.\nFoster ranks third in Miami history in career points per game at 18.8 and seventh in career rebounds per game at 8.9 from 1966 to 1968. He had a career field goal percentage of .484.\nNBA career.\nHe was drafted in the third round of the 1968 NBA draft by the Cincinnati Royals and was also selected in the 1968 American Basketball Association draft by the Kentucky Colonels.\nIn his rookie season with the Royals, Foster made his debut on October 19, 1968, as the Royals' last man in a win over the Detroit Pistons. For the season, he averaged 3.4 points per game.\nFoster came on strong in his second season, 1969–70, when he averaged 14.8 points and 4.8 rebounds per game, both career highs. He also had career highs in minutes per game (28.1) and field goal percentage (.449). He twice had a single-game career best of 32 points—on January 7, 1970, against the Milwaukee Bucks when he made 13 field goals and was 6-for-6 at the free throw line, and again on February 15 against the San Diego Rockets.\nIn 1970–71, after playing one game with the Royals, he was traded along with Connie Dierking to the Philadelphia 76ers for Darrall Imhoff and a future draft pick. For the season, Foster averaged 5.5 points and 2.3 rebounds per game.\nIn 1971–72, he was a steady contributor, averaging 23 minutes per game and 11.9 points and 3.7 rebounds per game. He had a season-high 30 points on February 10, 1972, against the Golden State Warriors.\nPrior to the 1972–73 season, on July 31, 1972, Foster was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers for a future draft pick, then on the same day Portland traded him to the Detroit Pistons for Terry Dischinger. In 23.2 minutes per game, he averaged 8.7 points per game.\nOn October 8, 1973, he was waived by the Pistons and three weeks later signed as a free agent with the Cleveland Cavaliers for the 1973–74 season, averaging 4.8 points per game. In 1974–75, he upped his average to 6.9 points per game.\nHe did not play in the 1975–76 season, and in 1976–77 he returned to the NBA, signing as a free agent with the Buffalo Braves, for whom he averaged 3.9 points per game in his eighth and final NBA season.\nPersonal life.\nFoster died in 1985 at age 39 in his hometown of Springfield, Ohio. In 1998, he was posthumously inducted into the Miami Athletics Hall of Fame. In 2017, he was enshrined into the Ohio Basketball Hall of Fame. His sister accepted his posthumous award on behalf of their family.\nReferences.\nBook,\"Cincinnati's Basketball Royalty\" by Gerry Schultz"

        "text": "The Gay and Lesbian Tennis Alliance (GLTA) is a not-for-profit international organization that manages and sanctions the gay tennis circuit around the world. The goal of the organization is to promote access to tennis and diversity and acceptance within the sport. GLTA-sanctioned tournaments provide a safe space for LGBT players to have fun playing competitive tennis in an environment where all who share the value of diversity are welcome.\nFounding.\nThe first gay tennis groups emerged in Dallas, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Houston as early as 1979. During the 1980s an informal gay and lesbian tennis \"circuit\" began to form. By the late 1980s gay tennis organizations were hosting tournaments that drew players from around the U.S., and the idea of a more formalized gay tennis circuit was becoming popular around the time of the 1990 Gay Games in Vancouver.\nThe GLTA was founded in 1991, and there are now over 80 gay and lesbian member clubs around the world. The first officers were elected at the San Diego Open in July 1991. The first Commissioner of the GLTA was Scott Williford, who was also elected to the GLTA Hall of Fame in 1992 along with Les Balmain, who founded of the San Francisco Gay Tennis Federation in 1981. Other original GLTA board members were Norm Burgos, David Black, Chris Walker, and Gary Sutton. The organization continued to grow rapidly in the 1990s and spread to Australia, Canada, and Europe.\nRecent Status.\nTournaments in Thailand, Ireland and Australia were added to the portfolio of events in 2010, increasing the number of tournaments to over 80 around the globe. An estimated 10,000 players take part in GLTA tournaments each year, and the number of tournaments and players continues to grow. Individual tournaments range in size from less than 100 competitors to over 400. Depending on the location, tournaments take place on grass, clay, or cement (hard) courts. Many tournaments encourage international participation by asking local competitors to host visiting players at their homes.\nPlayers at all levels can compete within divisions determined by ability—the Open division being the highest, followed by divisions A, B, C, and D. Where possible, similar divisions are provided for players over 40 years old. Each year, an international GLTA World Tour Championships invites the top 8 players in each of the 5 GLTA divisions to compete.\nTournaments are usually organized at a local level by clubs and associations, while the GLTA provides technical support, governance, and direction. Each event raises funds for charitable causes chosen by that particular association, and each cause usually has a tie to gay and lesbian issues such as HIV prevention or the mentoring of gay youth.\nThe GLTA is developing partnerships with national sports organizations such as the United States Tennis Association (USTA) which have identified diversity as a worthwhile objective. The organization has begun to formulate a financial and organizational support strategy to bring events to communities where the political, legal, and cultural situation for gays and lesbians limits opportunities to compete in the sport without hiding their sexuality."

Detroit would win the series 3–1 to win their first Stanley Cup.\nPath to the Final.\nDetroit defeated the defending champion Montreal Maroons in a best-of-five 3–0 to advance to the Finals. The Leafs had to play a total-goals series; 8–6 against Boston Bruins, and win a best-of-three 2–1 against the New York Americans to advance to the Finals.\nStanley Cup engraving.\nThe 1936 Stanley Cup was presented to Red Wings captain Doug Young by NHL President Frank Calder following the Red Wings 3–2 win over the Maple Leafs in game four.\nThe following Red Wings players and staff had their names engraved on the Stanley Cup\n1935–36 Detroit Red Wings\nDetroit: \"City of Champions\".\nWhen the Red Wings won the 1936 Stanley Cup, the City of Detroit was mired in the Great Depression, which had hit Detroit and its industries particularly hard. But with the success of the Red Wings and other Detroit teams and athletes in the 1935/36 sports season, Detroit's luck appeared to be changing, as the city was dubbed the \"City of Champions\". The Detroit Tigers started the winning streak by winning the 1935 World Series, and the Detroit Lions continued the process by capturing the 1935 NFL Championship Game. When the Red Wings completed their own championship drive, the city had seen three major sporting league championships in less than a year. Detroit's champions also included Detroit's \"Brown Bomber\", Joe Louis, the heavyweight boxing titlist; native Detroiter Gar Wood, top unlimited powerboat racer and the first man to go 100 miles per hour on water; and Eddie \"the Midnight Express\" Tolan, a black Detroiter who won gold medals in the 100- and 200-meter races at the 1932 Summer Olympics."

        "text": "Ealing Trailfinders Rugby Club is an English professional rugby union club based in West London. The club's first team were the champions of the RFU Championship in 2021/22 but were considered ineligible for promotion to Premiership Rugby as their home ground's capacity is too small. They were promoted to the league after they won National League 1 in 2014–15.\nStructure of the club.\nThe club's registered playing name with the RFU is Ealing Trailfinders. The club is a Mutual Society registered with the FSA, and run on behalf of its members and the game. The club is located in West London at Trailfinders Sports Ground, just south of the A40 at the upper end of West Ealing.\nThe club has a first team squad, Men's Section, Academy Section, Youth Section, Minis Section and Referees Section. The Ealing Trailfinders first team finished as champions in National League 1 for season 2012–13 and won promotion, for the first time, to the second tier of the English rugby union leagues, the RFU Championship. After one season they finished in twelfth place and were relegated back to National League 1. They were then promoted once more the following season and have remained in the Championship ever since.\nThe Men's Section runs four teams, competing in The Shield and the Middlesex Merit Leagues, and Middlesex Veterans League. The academy and Youth Sections are for players aged 13 to 23 and the new academy feeds players directly into senior rugby. The youth teams cater for boys and girls at all levels of ability and currently have players representing the county at all age group levels, as well as players just being introduced to the game. The youth play in the Hertfordshire and Middlesex leagues and, in season 2011–12, were league winners at U14 level as well as winning Division Three at U16 level. The club is active at all levels. The mini and youth sections have teams in several age groups with over 750 registered players, making it the biggest club in Middlesex and one of the largest in the country. The club's junior teams are regular winners of County Festivals, and champions of the Herts and Middlesex Leagues for Youth Rugby.\nThe club has developed a pathway for female players starting at 10 and running through to U18. Known as the Emeralds, this section has provided players to the England Elite Programme. The club has also seen players develop through the new structures to play for England and U.S.\nHistory.\n1869 – 1995.\nFounded as Ealing Football Club (RU), the team played its first match in 1869 on Ealing Common, prior to the formation of the Rugby Football Union in 1871. The early years saw regular fixtures against the likes of Wasps, London Irish, Harlequins, Richmond and Blackheath with 75% win rate for a long period.\nLeopold de Rothschild was the first president of the club and held this office from 1896 to 1914.\nBetween 1894 and 1958 the club moved location numerous times – Hanger Lane – West Middlesex Polo Club – Gunnersbury Park – Drayton Green – Syon Lane, Horsenden Hill.\nEaling Rugby Club's centenary match was played against Harlequins in 1970. In the 1970s and ’80s Ealing supplied many county level players for Middlesex. In 1987 the club finished top of London Division 1 and during the next six years was never lower than 2nd in London 1 nor higher than 10th in National 5. Ealing won the Middlesex cup three times in this period.\n1995 – present.\nIn 1996 Ealing were relegated from London 1. In response, the club formed youth and minis sections, and moved to a new ground at Trailfinders Sports Club in 1999. The club has been awarded two RFU Presidents Awards, the first in 2007 for its work on referee development that has extended into a national programme, and the second in 2008 for coaching excellence. In 2009, the club fielded two first team players who had been developed through the Juniors.\nIn the 2009–10, season the club was the only team in the National Leagues to score more than 1,000 points, averaging more than 36 in each game. The club narrowly missed out on promotion to National One by losing to Barking RFC by 2 points and Rosslyn Park by 1.\nIn 2010–11, the club started its Community Rugby programme providing coaching support and access to the game to schools and other groups throughout Ealing and West London. During this season, Ealing's winger Phil Chesters scored 70 tries which is the record for the most tries in an English Rugby season.\n2007–08: National Division 3 South, 3rd place Mounts Bay 1st; Cinderford 2nd\n2008–09: National Division 3 South, 3rd place London Scottish 1st; Rosslyn Park 2nd\n2009–10: National League 2 South, 3rd place Barking 1st; Rosslyn Park 2nd\n2010–11: National League 2 South, 1st place Jersey 2nd\n2011–12: National League 1, 2nd place Jersey 1st\n2012–13: National League 1, 1st place Esher 2nd\n2013–14: RFU Championship, 12th\nMidway through the season long-serving director of rugby Mike Cudmore announced that he would be stepping down at the season's end. Head coach and fly-half Ben Ward was appointed director of coaching from the start of the 2014–15 season. After fighting against relegation for the majority of the season, Ealing Trailfinders were eventually relegated on the final day of the season by one point after they lost at home to Rotherham Titans, while Jersey won away to Bedford Blues\n2014–15: National League 1: 1st\nEaling Trailfinders quickly established themselves in first place in National 1 and they won the title with a haul of 136 points, nine ahead of their nearest rivals Rosslyn Park.\n2015–16: RFU Championship: 11th\nEaling had another tough season in life back in the Championship, however were able to beat Birmingham Moseley on the last day of the season, ensuring survival in the second division of English Rugby.\n2016–17: RFU Championship : 3rd\nEaling Trailfinders announced the appointment of Alex Codling as Head Coach at Ealing, with Ben Ward being named as director of rugby. The club also signed long time servant of London Scottish and Championship veteran Mark Bright, who became captain on a regular basis as the season progressed. Ealing's season progressed well, winning important games against strong opposition such as Cornish Pirates and Jersey reds and only losing 23–24 to eventual league winners London Irish, where Ealing were winning up until the last minute of the game. Ealing reached the play-offs, eventually finishing 3rd, the highest league position the club has achieved. They faced Yorkshire Carnegie, who in the first leg beat Ealing 34–16. The 2nd leg ended 20–18 to Ealing with a standout end to end try by Luke Peters at the death. However this was not enough, as Carnegie progressed to the final (agg 52–36).\n2017–2018: RFU Championship : 2nd\nEaling Trailfinders started the 2017–2018 campaign after having their most successful season in the club's history. At the start of the season, Mark Bright was named Ealing's Club Captain. The team won the final of the British and Irish Cup against Leinster 'A' 22–7, the last winners of the competition. Towards the end of the season Ealing announced over 25 signings, including the likes of Sam Olver, Guy Armitage, Craig Willis, Harry Sloan, Jordy Reid, and the re-signing of Andrew Durutalo (who had left earlier in the season). Ealing also released about 3/4 of their team from this season.\nDuring a Talksport Interview, Ben Ward, Director of Rugby announced that Ealing wanted promotion to the premiership due to the impending danger of ring-fencing.\n2020–21: Seeking Premiership Promotion.\nTrailfinders finished top of the table during the 2020–21 Championship season and contested a two-legged play-off with Saracens for promotion. In order to be a premiership club, Ealing must increase the capacity of Vallis Way or ground share with a local club. In June 2021, it was confirmed that a ground-share deal at Saracens' Copthall Stadium was in place but the RFU would not permit promotion as a deadline had been missed. Ealing intended to appeal this decision as they claim they had not had sufficient information from the league.\n2021-22: Championship winner\nFollowing the final round of fixtures, Trailfinders remained top of the table and were therefore crowned champions on 2 April 2022.\nIt had previously been announced that they were once again ineligible for promotion due to capacity of Vallis Way. Trailfinders expressed their disappointment to this ruling stating they had a three-year sustainable plan to reach the required capacity. Their appeal against the decision was withdrawn in April 2022.\n2022–2023: RFU Championship holders\nEaling entered the season as reigning champions, and had finished in the top two in each of the last five years. However, it was announced in February 2023 that Trailfinders were once again ineligible for promotion to the Premiership due to their ground not meeting the criteria. They did not nominate an alternative ground for audit.\nEaling 1871.\nEaling Trailfinders also has an amateur team called Ealing 1871 formed in 2019. Ealing 1871 entered the English league structure for the first team during the 2019–20 season, experiencing instant success as they finished as champions of Herts/Middlesex 2 in their debut season.\nClub honours.\nEaling Trailfinders\nEaling 1871 (Amateur)\nCurrent squad.\nThe Ealing Trailfinders senior squad for the 2023–24 season is: "

        "text": "The Spain women's national basketball team () represents Spain in international women's basketball competition and are regulated by the Spanish Basketball Federation, the governing body for basketball in Spain. Spain has one of the most successful women's national teams in the world, being the current FIBA Women's EuroBasket 2023 silver medallists.\nHistory.\nSpain women's basketball team played their first official game in Malgrat de Mar, Barcelona, against Switzerland on 16 June 1963, losing 31–40. They won their first game against the same team two days later, 47–39. It would take six years to play another international friendly game, losing to Cuba 50–70 on 28 September 1969. \nTheir first official games were in March 1970, trying to qualify for the 1970 EuroBasket, winning their first game against Switzerland 61–44 and losing to Hungary and France. The team qualified for their first major international tournament in their next attempt, the 1974 EuroBasket. After losing their three group stage games, they won their first game in a final tournament against Denmark in the placement matches, finishing in 12th position. Rosa Castillo is considered the best player from the mid-70s to the mid-80s.\nUntil 1985, Spain played most Eurobasket tournaments, usually finishing around 10th. An important year for the evolution of the team was the celebration on home soil of the 1987 EuroBasket, finishing on 6th position. The team entered their first Summer Olympics qualification in 1988, but failed to qualify. Their first Olympic games were also on home soil in the 1992 Summer Olympics, finishing 5th.\nAfter failing to qualify for the two previous Eurobaskets and having never played a knockout game in a major tournament, the gold medal at the 1993 EuroBasket came as a surprise, beating the newly formed Slovakia in the semi-finals 73–55 and France in the final 63–53. With Blanca Ares as their key player (19 PPG), Spain undoubtedly took advantage of the dissolution of the dominant European teams of Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, and especially the Soviet Union.\nThe EuroBasket victory gave Spain the right to participate in the 1994 Women's World Cup for the first time, finishing 8th. Since then, the team has qualified for every World Cup -seven in a row-, winning three medals.\nFrom 2001 up to 2009, Spain entered a loop of winning five consecutive medals in the Eurobaskets (1 silver, 4 bronze) and being eliminated in the quarterfinals in Summer Olympics and World Cups, until they finally won bronze in the 2010 Women's World Cup. From her debut in 1995 to her retirement in 2013, forward Amaya Valdemoro became the leader of the Spanish squad, taking part in 13 tournaments, playing 258 games, winning 7 medals and becoming the top scorer with 2,743 points.\nThe defeat against Croatia on 26 June in Katowice in the second stage of the 2011 EuroBasket and the consequent absence from the 2012 Olympics has been cited by coaches and players as a catalyst for a \"golden period\" of seven consecutive medals under coach Lucas Mondelo. After playing the qualification matches in the summer of 2012, Spain went on to win the 2013 EuroBasket with a balance of 9–0. Afterwards, they won silver in the 2014 Women's World Cup, bronze in the 2015 EuroBasket, silver in the 2016 Summer Olympics and gold again in the 2017 EuroBasket. Spain also won the bronze medal at the 2018 Women's World Cup held on home soil in September 2018. In July 2019 Spain successfully defended their European crown by beating France 86–66 in the final of the EuroBasket Women 2019. These seven successful tournaments came to a halt in the summer of 2021, when the team finished 7th in the 2021 EuroBasket played on home soil and 6th in the 2020 Olympic Games. These results are quite commendable, considering that Spain have only competed with the world elite for two decades. This series of results took the Spanish team to be ranked No. 2 in the ranking of FIBA. In the FIBA Women's EuroBasket 2023, despite a strong performance, they lost to Belgium in the final.\nIn the senior team for two decades (2002-2021) point guard Laia Palau is the record-holder for most caps (314) and most medals (12) in 19 final tournaments. In the team since 2008, forward Alba Torrens has been regarded as the most talented player of this generation, having won 9 medals in 12 tournaments. \nAt the Mediterranean Games, Spain won gold in 1991, and bronze in 1993, 2001 and 2005.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket Women 2023.\nIndividual records.\nTop highscorers.\nTop highscorers in official games (friendlies not included).\nTop medallists.\nMost medals won with the national team in Olympic Games, Women's World Cups and EuroBaskets:\nHead coaches.\nTimeline of head coaches with games and results in final tournaments at the (EuroBasket, Women's World Cup and Olympics)&lt;br&gt;(*) "

        "text": "World Cup All Stars, founded by Elaine Pascale and Joelle Antico, is home to the 2007, 2008, 2009, 2015, 2017, and 2019 USASF Cheerleading Worlds champions in the Large Senior All Girl division, the World Cup Shooting Stars. In the International Junior All Girl division, the World Cup Starlites are the 2007 and 2008 World Champions. World Cup was founded in 1994 in Freehold, New Jersey by owner Elaine Pascale and her daughter Joelle Antico. World Cup is one of the most respected all-star programs in the U.S.\nHistory.\nWorld Cup grew out of the Pop Warner success of mother–daughter team Elaine Pascale and Joelle Antico. For many years, Pascale served as coach of the local Pop Warner team that Antico had joined. Eventually, the family moved to Freehold, New Jersey, where Pascale found herself coaching a Pop Warner midget squad. By this time Antico was attending Penn State and would come home on weekends to assist her mother with the team. In 1992, the pair won their first Pop Warner National Championship. The transition from Pop Warner to all stars was not a big leap for Pascale and Antico. After the national win and with the Pop Warner season over, a small group of their students and parents persuaded them to start a competition squad, and the World Cup All Stars were born.\nWorld Cup All Stars officially began in 1994. The first team formed was the Shooting Stars. In 1995 World Cup won its very first national championship. From that point, the team from World Cup has won numerous national championships from NCA, Spirit Sports, Americheer, WSF and many other companies. Most recently, winning 2015 IASF Cheerleading Worlds in the Large Senior All Girl division and earning the bronze in the International Junior division. Both the Large Senior All Girl (Shooting Stars) and International Junior All Girl (Starlites) are back-to-back world champions, winning in both 2007 and 2008. Also in 2008, World Cup's Large Senior Limited Coed Team (Odyssey) received 3rd place at the Cheerleading Worlds. One of their other well known teams is the Twinkles. They are a youth level 5 team composed of girls ages 8–12 who compete many of the same advanced stunt and tumbling skills as the teams composed of much older athletes. This team has won the NCA National Championship five times recently, in 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015, and 2017. Both in 2012 and 2014, Twinkles finished the season undefeated. Starlites won NCA in 2011, 2014, and 2015. Cosmic Rays won NCA in 2012. The Shooting Stars have won NCA eight times in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2016. World Cup has had multiple teams competing in the Cheerleading Worlds for years. In 2014, they have received 4 full paid bids to attend Worlds, one for each of their Worlds eligible teams.\nWorld Cup didn't win any world Championships from 2009-2014, though Shooting Stars still medaled in Large Senior each year. In 2015 Shooting Stars won World Cup's 6th and the team's 4th World Championship title in 6 years in the Large Senior All Girl Level 5 division! This broke a tie the team held with Cheer Extreme Allstars Senior Elite for winning the most times in the division; previously both held 3 titles respectively. In 2014 World Cup Allstars acquired two Pennsylvania based cheer gyms, Keystone Extreme and Rocket Elite, that will henceforth be known as World Cup Genesis and World Cup Phoenix respectively. Both gyms will have Worlds teams this 2014-2015 season.\nIn 2008, American Cheerleader Magazine ranked World Cup the 2nd \"Top All Star Program\" in the country.\nWorld Championship Placements 2006-2017.\nP: Prelims\nSF: Semi-Finals\nPublicity.\nWorld Cup All Stars has received a considerable amount of publicity, and has been in various media. They were featured in a 2004 and 2005 performance at the Career Transition for Dancers gala, performing alongside Toni Basil, Bette Midler, Patti LaBelle and Liza Minnelli. As a result of the performance with Toni Basil of her hit \"Mickey\", she named the Shooting Stars the official Mickey cheerleaders. They have also been featured in \"Time Magazine\", the \"New York Times\", \"American Cheerleader Magazine\", \"All-star Cheer Magazine\", \"Inside Cheerleading Magazine\", and \"Cheer Coach &amp; Advisor\". In 2009, the Shooting Stars were invited to act as the Glee Cheerleaders at the Glee NYC premiere party.\nin 2012, the World Cup Twinkles (Youth Level 5) had their own 1-hour documentary and media companion called \"Twinkles Chasing Perfection\" produced by The Star Ledger."

        "text": "The 2007 UCI Road World Championships – Women's Road Race took place on September 29, 2007 around the German city of Stuttgart. The race started at 9:00.\nThe race was won by Italian Marta Bastianelli, who broke away 15 km from the finish and held a gap over the chasing group. Last year's champion Marianne Vos of the Netherlands took silver with Giorgia Bronzini of Italy taking bronze to cap a dominant performance by the Italian team. It was Bastianelli's first victory of the season.\nRace.\nAlthough the sun was out at the start of the race, the road were still wet and treacherous. The first victim of the conditions was Toni Bradshaw of New Zealand, this was the first of many early crashes, which included Zulfiya Zabirova.\nThe race started at a gentle pace but the climbs immediately stretched out the field. Rosario Rodriguez Maria of Spain attacked but was not successful, so the front of the peloton remained quiet. The first lap was completed in just over 33 minutes, with an average speed of 34.709 km/h.\nThe second lap was equally uneventful, except for Christine Thorburn of the United States who suffered a slight mechanical. Her chain came off on an uphill section, bringing her to a standstill and impeding the progress of several other riders. The second lap was completed in 33'07\", an average speed of 34.604 km/h.\nThe Brazilian Clemilda Fernandes Silva attempted to attack on the third lap, but was marked by the strongest teams. The peloton completed the third lap marginally slower, in 33'32\" (average speed 34.494 km/h).\nThe Italian rider Tatiana Guderzo launched an attack on lap four. Katheryn Curi (USA), Oxana Kozonchuk (Russia) and Hanka Kupfernagel (Germany) responded immediately. Kupfernagel marked attacks throughout the race, attempting to ensure a sprint finish for teammate Judith Arndt, Kupfernagel had already won a gold medal in the time trial. Trixi Worrack was the second rider to drop her chain on a climb, but a passing teammate gave her a little push to get her going again. Lap four was completed nearly a minute faster than the previous lap, with an average speed 34.66 km/h.\nIt was Guderzo who attacked again on the fifth lap, with the first serious attack of the race. She quickly built 10 second lead, which was then extended to 20 seconds. Other riders began to attack including Spaniards, Australians and Swiss riders, but the German team was trying to keep the race under control and no others were able to get away. Guderzo was within the bunch's sights when an advertising barrier was blown over, bringing down several riders, including Priska Doppmann, Maribel Moreno Allue, Regina Bruins and Edita Pučinskaitė. The peloton's rhythm was sufficiently disrupted so that Guderzo was once more able to increase her lead.\nWith two laps to go, Guderzo had a second lead, but it was never more than 25 seconds. Noemi Cantele was 43 seconds behind having been caught up in the crash, but with the help of her team she quickly caught up. It was the turn of the American team set the pace, as Amber Neben attacked, but Cantele went with her, driving the break as they caught and passed Guderzo, gaining 25 seconds on the bunch. But the gap began to fall as the bunch worked hard up the climbs, catching Neben and Cantele two kilometres before the start of the final lap. This penultimae lap had been the fastest so far, completed in 31'37\", an average speed of 36.246 km/h.\nDefending champion Marianne Vos and Cantele attacked on the first climb of the final lap, and built small lead. It was Marta Bastianelli's turn to attack from the front of the bunch, she did so strongly, taking advantage of other riders' hesitation. A group of around a dozen riders was able to catch back up to the second group, which consisted of seven riders.\nBastianelli increased her lead to 20 seconds, and despite a brief problem with her chain, she was soon approximately 15 seconds ahead of the small chase group made up of 22 riders. She had wanted to avoid sprinting head to head with Marianne Vos; her tactics worked as she crossed the line first. Vos came in to take the bunch sprint and second position, just in front of Giorgia Bronzini.\nFinal classification.\nSeptember 29, 2007: Stuttgart, 133.7 km\nDid not finish.\n61 riders failed to finish the race."

From 1977 to 1991, Johnson's teams at Maurice J. McDonough High School in Pomfret, Maryland were annually ranked among the top squads in the Washington Metropolitan Area. In his final eight years, the Ram dynasty amassed an 82-10 record, made eight consecutive appearances in the state playoffs, were 8–2 in championship games and captured three Division 3A state championships (1983, 1985, and 1990). His overall record as head coach was 139–36.\nFrom 1992 to 1993, Johnson was head coach at T. C. Williams High School in Alexandria, Virginia. He was hired by his brother AK Johnson, the school's athletic director.\nCollege coaching career.\nPenn State.\nJohnson was the defensive line coach at Penn State from 2000 to 2013. From 1996 to 1999 he served as the Nittany Lions' defensive ends and special teams coach. In that time, Johnson developed a reputation for being a premier blue chip recruiter, consistently landing top talent from the mid-Atlantic states. He was instrumental in the development of five first-team All-Americans there: Devon Still, first-round NFL draft choices Tamba Hali, Michael Haynes, and Jimmy Kennedy, and former first-overall selection Courtney Brown.\nJohnson was offered the defensive coordinator and assistant head coach job at Illinois in January 2009. He ultimately decided to continue at Penn State. On November 10, 2011 Tom Bradley announced that Johnson and linebackers coach Ron Vanderlinden would serve as co-defensive coordinators.\n On January 7, 2012, Johnson was retained as a coach on the team's staff with the arrival of new head coach Bill O'Brien. On January 1, 2014, Johnson was named interim head coach after O'Brien's departure to the NFL.\nOhio State.\nJohnson left Penn State following the 2013 season after 18 years when he was hired by Ohio State to be an assistant head coach and defensive line coach. At Ohio State, Johnson is known for his ability to develop several highly-touted NFL prospects such as Joey Bosa, Nick Bosa, and Chase Young. All three would later go on to win the NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year award in their respective seasons. Johnson is also lauded for developing the talents of recently drafted defensive linemen such as Sam Hubbard, Dre'Mont Jones, Zach Harrison, Tyquan Lewis, Tommy Togiai, Jonathon Cooper, and Tyreke Smith.\nJohnson was Ohio State's acting head coach for the 2020 win over Michigan State after head coach Ryan Day had tested positive for COVID-19.\nPersonal.\nJohnson has two sons, Larry, who was a running back at Penn State and for nine seasons in the NFL and Tony, who was a wide receiver at Penn State in the early 2000s."

        "text": "The 1969 Masters Tournament was the 33rd Masters Tournament, held April 10–13 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nGeorge Archer won his only major championship, one stroke ahead of runners-up Billy Casper, George Knudson, and Tom Weiskopf. Third round leader Casper was five over-par after ten holes in his final round, then regrouped with three birdies but needed another. Weiskopf was tied for the lead until a bogey at 17, and future champion Charles Coody bogeyed the final three holes and finished two strokes back. Casper would win the title in 1970 in a playoff and Coody would win in 1971.\nThis was the last Masters that Ken Venturi participated in, and he missed the cut by twelve strokes. As an amateur in 1956, Venturi led after 54 holes but finished runner-up to Jack Burke Jr. Burke made the cut at the Masters for the final time in 1969 and finished in 24th place. Past champions were noticeably absent from the leaderboard this year, as Burke tied for the best finish with three-time winner Jack Nicklaus.\nIt was Archer's third Masters and his only top ten finish at Augusta; his next best result was tied for eleventh in 1981.\nBob Lunn won the tenth Par 3 contest on Wednesday with a score of 23.\nCourse.\n^ \nField.\nGay Brewer (9,11), Jack Burke Jr., Doug Ford, Bob Goalby (8,10), Ralph Guldahl, Claude Harmon, Herman Keiser, Cary Middlecoff, Jack Nicklaus (2,3,8,9), Arnold Palmer (10,11), Henry Picard, Gary Player (2,3,8,9), Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead (9), Art Wall Jr. (8)\nBilly Casper (8,9,10,11), Lee Trevino (9), Ken Venturi\nJulius Boros (8,9,10,11), Al Geiberger (9,10,11), Don January (8), Dave Marr (8), Bobby Nichols (9,11)\nBob Barbarossa (a), John Bohmann (a), Bruce Fleisher (6,7,a), Vinny Giles (7,8,a), Hubert Green (a), Jack Lewis Jr. (7,a), Rik Massengale (a), Allen Miller (a)\nDick Siderowf (a)\nTommy Aaron, George Archer (9,10), Miller Barber (10), Frank Beard (10), Gardner Dickinson (11), Raymond Floyd, Lionel Hebert, Jerry Pittman (9), Mason Rudolph, Doug Sanders (10,11), Tom Weiskopf, Bert Yancey (9), Kermit Zarley (10)\nDon Bies, Rod Funseth, Dave Hill, Steve Spray, Dave Stockton\nFrank Boynton, Charles Coody, Marty Fleckman, Lou Graham, Dan Sikes\nGene Littler, Johnny Pott\nBob Murphy\nDeane Beman, Dale Douglass, Bob Lunn, Mac McLendon, R.

Earlier in the round Devlin had made a great scrambling bogey at the difficult Par-4 11th after finding the water on his second shot, but could not repeat the magic when he found the water at 16. \nFinal round.\n\"Sunday, April 13, 1969\"\nSummary.\nBilly Casper started the final round at 8-under par with a one-stroke lead over George Archer, but Casper bogeyed five of the first 10 holes. Meanwhile, Archer gained a three-stroke lead at 8-under after 9 holes over George Knudson, Charles Coody and Tom Weiskopf (who was playing with Archer). As the back nine unfolded there was a lot of movement on the leaderboard and standing on the 18th tee, five of the last 6 players on the course had a chance to win the tournament outright or force a Monday playoff. Only Miller Barber, playing with Casper in the final group, was out of contention for the title. The final three groups ended up on the 18th hole at the same time: Casper (−6) and Barber (-3) waiting on the tee with Archer (−7) and Weiskopf (−6) looking on from the fairway while Coody (−6) was left of the green needing to chip in for a birdie to tie and Knudson (−6) on the green some 26 feet away also needing a tying birdie.\nFinal leaderboard.\nSources:\nScorecard.\n\"Cumulative tournament scores, relative to par\"&lt;br&gt;"

He holds a unique record in Australian rugby league history as the only man to captain two clubs to Grand Final premiership success.\nClub career.\nSt George Dragons\nSteve Edge was graded with the St George Dragons in 1972 and that year played in the club's premiership winning third grade side.\nHe became a regular first grader from 1974 and played in the 1975 Grand Final side that lost to the Eastern Suburbs Roosters. Edge captained the 1977 Dragons' side, playing in the historic 1977 drawn Grand Final and subsequent replay victory the following week.

Edge was regarded as a fine on-field leader, never an overly flashy player with the ball. He had to overcome a serious eye injury (detached retina and punctured iris) to take his place in the 1984 Grand Final and retired after his club's narrow 6–4 loss to the Canterbury Bulldogs. In 1993, Edge was made a life member of the Parramatta club.\nIn 2002, Edge was inducted into Parramatta's hall of fame.\nRepresentative career.\nEdge toured New Zealand with a Combined Sydney side in 1976.

        "text": "The 1990 Rose Bowl was the 76th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Monday, January 1. The game was a rematch of the previous year, won by Michigan, 22–14. Gaining a measure of revenge, the USC Trojans upset the third-ranked Michigan Wolverines, 17–10. USC junior running back Ricky Ervins was named the Player Of The Game. This was Bo Schembechler's final game as Michigan's head coach, and he finished with a 2–8 record in Rose Bowls.\nPre-game activities.\nOn Tuesday, October 24, 1989, Tournament of Roses President Don W. Fedde chose 17-year-old Yasmine Begum Delawari, a senior at La Canada High School and a resident of La Cañada Flintridge, California. She became the 72nd Rose Queen to reign over the 101st Rose Parade and the 76th Rose Bowl Game on New Year's Day.\nThe game was presided over by the 1990 Tournament of Roses Royal Court and Rose Parade Grand Marshal John Glenn, U.S. Senator from Ohio and an original astronaut. Members of the court included princesses Kristin Gibbs, South Pasadena, Pasadena City College; Inger Miller, Altadena, John Muir High School; Marisa Stephenson, Arcadia, Arcadia High School; Joanne Ward, Arcadia, Arcadia High School; Kandace Watson, Pasadena, John Muir High School; and Peggy Ann Zazueta, Temple City, Maranatha High School.\nTeams.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nThe Wolverines lost their opening game, at home, to Notre Dame 24–19. The UCLA Bruins under Terry Donahue and the Michigan Wolverines under Bo Schembechler met for the only time since the 1983 Rose Bowl in a UCLA home game at the Rose Bowl on September 23, 1989. The fifth-ranked Michigan Wolverines defeated #24 UCLA by a point, 24–23. This began a ten-game winning streak for Michigan, the biggest win being a 24–10 win at Illinois that ultimately gave the Big Ten title to Michigan over the runner-up Illini.\nUSC Trojans.\nUSC lost their opener to Illinois 14–13, but won the rest with the exception of a 28–24 mid-season loss at Notre Dame and a 10–10 tie in their regular season finale with rival UCLA. They won the Pac-10 title by 2½ games over Washington, who had struggled early in the season.\nIt was a third-straight berth in the Rose Bowl for the Trojans, but they had lost the previous two, the only such streak in USC history (through , no Pac-12 team has done so since). The previous western team to lose consecutively was California, which dropped three straight (1949–1951) while representing the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC).\nGame summary.\nThe game was expected to be a tight physical defensive struggle, and it was. USC scored first, when quarterback Todd Marinovich ran for a touchdown and led 10–3 at halftime, but Michigan came back to tie the score in the third quarter. Midway through the fourth quarter, Michigan faced a 4th-and-2 at its own 46-yard line. The normally conservative Schembechler called for a fake punt and it worked to perfection as punter Chris Stapleton rambled 24 yards for what would have been a first down, but Michigan was called for holding. On the resultant drive, USC scored the winning touchdown with just over a minute to play.\nAt the end of the game, Schembechler walked off the field as head coach for the last time, refusing interview requests; he remained briefly as the athletic director, a post he gained concurrently in 1988. A few days later, he announced he was leaving Michigan to become the president of the Detroit Tigers of Major League Baseball.\nScoring.\nFirst quarter.\n\"None\" 0–0 tie\nSecond quarter.\nUSC: Todd Marinovich, 1-yard run (Quin Rodriguez kick), USC 7–0&lt;br&gt; \nMich: J.D.

        "title": "1989 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1989 Rose Bowl was the 75th edition of the college football bowl game, played at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, on Monday, January 2. This year marked the 100th anniversary of the Tournament of Roses parade. The Michigan Wolverines of the Big Ten Conference upset the fifth-ranked USC Trojans of the Pacific-10 Conference, 22–14. Down by eleven points at halftime, the Wolverines shut out the Trojans in the second half and won by eight. Michigan fullback Leroy Hoard was named the Player of the Game.\nIt marked consecutive Rose Bowl wins for the Big Ten, which had only two victories (1974, 1981) in the previous eighteen (1970–1987). Michigan head coach Bo Schembechler's record in the game improved to . Under second-year head coach Larry Smith, USC lost consecutive Rose Bowls for the only time in its history, and through , no Pac-12 team has done so since. The previous western team to lose consecutively was California, which lost three straight (1949–1951) while representing the Pacific Coast Conference (PCC).\nThis was the first of 22 Rose Bowls televised by ABC; it had been on NBC since the first television broadcast in January 1952. Because New Year's Day was on a Sunday in 1989, the game was played the next day. Both teams returned the following year for a rematch, with a different result.\nTeams.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nMichigan opened the season with consecutive narrow losses to Notre Dame and Miami (FL) who were ranked #13 and #1 respectively at the time. But they recovered to go unbeaten the rest of the way, their only blemish being a 17–17 tie at Iowa. A 17–3 win over defending Big 10 champ Michigan State proved to be the difference as Michigan won the Big 10 by one game over Michigan State.\nUSC Trojans.\nUSC opened the season with nine straight wins and rose to #2 in the rankings. They faced sixth ranked rival UCLA, who was 9–1 and had been ranked #1 for a couple of weeks earlier. The game in Pasadena was one of the notable ones in the UCLA–USC rivalry in that it was for the Pac-10 championship (Rose Bowl berth), and a possible Heisman Trophy for either starting quarterback, Troy Aikman of UCLA or Rodney Peete of USC. Peete was found to have measles in the days before the game; USC used a strong ground game and \"bend but don't break\" defense, in front of the largest Rose Bowl regular season crowd in history, to beat the Bruins 31–22.\nThe win set up a rare #2 USC vs. #1 Notre Dame matchup the following week in Los Angeles, which the undefeated Irish dominated, 27–10. It was the fifth straight loss for the Trojans in the annual rivalry, a winless streak that continued until 1996.\nGame summary.\nBehind the passing of Heisman Trophy runner-up Rodney Peete and running of Aaron Emmanuel, USC scored two touchdowns in the second quarter and took a 14–3 to halftime. Despite their lack of early success, Michigan stuck with its pounding running attack led by a huge offensive line and running back (and game MVP) Leroy Hoard. They began to wear down the Trojans and USC's offense began to sputter. By the fourth quarter, Michigan's offensive line took over and the Wolverines took a 22–14 lead into the last two minutes. Peete tried to lead the Trojans to a touchdown and game tying two-point conversion but Michigan's defense forced an interception to effectively end the game."

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Hollingsworth batted and threw left-handed. He was listed as tall and . Hollingsworth earned his nickname when, as a first baseman early in his career, he made an error in the field. He became a full-time pitcher during the 1933 season, his sixth in pro ball.\nHollingsworth was a member of the 1944 Browns, the only St. Louis–based team to win an American League pennant. Ironically, 1944 was Hollingsworth's worst regular season among the four full years he spent as a Brown; he won only five of 12 decisions, posted a poor 4.47 earned run average, and surrendered 108 hits and 37 bases on balls in 92 innings pitched, with only 22 strikeouts. He appeared in Game 4 of the \"All-St. Louis\" 1944 World Series, allowing one run in four innings pitched in relief of starting pitcher Sig Jakucki. He had two stellar seasons for the Browns, however, in 1942 and 1945, each time compiling winning records with an ERA of under 3.00.\nHollingsworth was also involved in a noteworthy trade earlier in his career when, on June 13, 1938, he was sent by Cincinnati to the Philadelphia Phillies along with catcher Spud Davis and $50,000 in cash for right-handed pitcher Bucky Walters. Walters would win 160 of 267 decisions during his Cincinnati pitching career, and help lead the Reds to the 1939 and 1940 National League pennants, and the 1940 World Series championship.\nHollingsworth appeared in 315 Major League games pitched, 185 as a starting pitcher. In 1,520 innings, he allowed 1,642 hits and 587 bases on balls, with 608 strikeouts, seven shutouts and 15 saves. His professional playing career lasted for 20 consecutive seasons, including minor league service. He then had a lengthy post-playing career as a manager in the St. Louis Cardinals and Cleveland Indians organizations, the pitching coach for the Cardinals from April 29, 1957, through 1958, and a scout for the Redbirds, Washington Senators, Houston Astros and Oakland Athletics.\nAs a hitter, Hollingsworth posted a .196 batting average (103-for-525) with 53 runs, 2 home runs, 32 RBIs and 23 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .966 fielding percentage.\nHollingsworth died April 28, 1996, in Austin, Texas, aged 88."

        "title": "Ice hockey in Ottawa",
        "text": "In Ottawa, Canada, ice hockey clubs date back to the first decade of recorded organized ice hockey play. The men's senior-level Ottawa Hockey Club is known to have played in a Canadian championship in 1884. Today, Ottawa hockey clubs are represented in all age brackets, in both men's and women's, in amateur and professional.\nEarly hockey.\nPrecursor games of ice hockey are known to have been played in Ottawa. The 1850s medal pictured was presented to a shinny tournament champion. The illustration on the medal depicts two players. The sticks are field hockey sticks and the game was played with a ball. The medal is in the collection of the City of Ottawa archives.\nEarly amateur era.\nJames Creighton, the organizer of the first indoor ice hockey game in 1875 moved to Ottawa and helped develop the game. He worked as a law clerk for the Senate chamber of the Parliament of Canada. Another important figure in the development of the game in Ottawa was P. D. Ross, the publisher of the Ottawa Journal, and later trustee of the Stanley Cup.\nThe Ottawa Hockey Club, formed in 1883. The club played its first competitive matches in the Montreal Winter Carnival tournament of 1884, and helped form the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada in 1886. The team went into hiatus from 1887 until 1889, when the new Rideau Skating Rink opened, and P. D. Ross helped to rebuild the hockey club. They would re-enter play in 1890, in the Ontario Hockey Association (OHA). Ottawa HC were the first winners in the OHA, from 1890 to 1893. They left the OHA after that season in a dispute over the location of playoffs for the Cosby Cup. This schism lead to today's organization of hockey in Ontario where the ODMHA is responsible for eastern Ontario rather than the OHA.\nWhen Lord Stanley was named Governor-General to Canada, he and his sons and daughter developed a keen interest in hockey, and games were played on a natural rink at Rideau Hall. His sons played on a team called the \"Rideau Hall Rebels\".\nOn March 8, 1889, the first recorded organized women's ice hockey match took place at Rideau Skating Rink.\nIn 1892, at an end-of-season banquet at the Russell House honouring the OHA champion Ottawa Hockey Club, Lord Stanley announced his donation of the \"Challenge Cup\", later to be known simply as the Stanley Cup.\nIn 1894, Ottawa HC played in the first Stanley Cup playoffs against the Montreal Victorias, played in Montreal.\nIn 1897 Ottawa HC rival Ottawa Capitals would play in Stanley Cup challenge against Montreal Victorias.\nIn 1901, the Ottawa Hockey Club won its first Canadian championship in the Canadian Amateur Hockey League, but did not challenge for the Stanley Cup.\nIn 1902, the Ottawa Hockey Club first used the nickname 'Senators'.\nIn 1903, the Ottawa Senators won their first Stanley Cup at the Dey's Arena. The individual players each received a silver nugget, and the team picked up the nickname of the \"Silver Seven\".\nFrom 1903 to 1906, the Silver Seven would defeat all challengers in Stanley Cup play, losing in March 1906 to rival Montreal Wanderers in the 1906 ECAHA championship.\nIn 1908, the Ottawa Victorias would challenge the Montreal Wanderers for the Stanley Cup. Losing a two-game playoff, they were the last amateur team from Ottawa to challenge for the Cup.\nIn 1909, the Ottawa Cliffsides were the first champions of the Allan Cup, by virtue of winning the Inter-provincial Hockey League. The Allan Cup was a new trophy given to the senior amateur champions of Canada, after the Stanley Cup was to be only contested by professional teams.\nOttawa City Hockey League.\nThe Ottawa City Hockey League was one of the first developmental competitive leagues. Teams played in junior and senior age groups. The league was formed in 1890 by the Ottawa Hockey Club, with senior teams only in the first season. Ottawa HC continued to operate a team in the OCHL, called the 'Seconds' after concentrating its first team effort in the AHAC. The league operated until 1945 and its teams dispersed between Quebec and Ottawa leagues.\nEarly professional era.\nThe Ottawa HC/Senators helped found or were inaugural season members of several professional leagues in Canada:\nThe Ottawa HC also played in the Federal Amateur Hockey League, which became professional in 1908. Ottawa HC played in the league before it became professional, but a second Senators professional team composed of former Silver Seven players, played in the then Federal Hockey League along with future NHA founders, the Renfrew Creamery Kings during the 1909 season.\nIn 1934, the Ottawa Hockey Association, the Senators NHL club owners, would split its hockey operations. The NHL club would relocate to St. Louis, Missouri and become the Eagles. The Eagles would play one season in St. Louis before the NHL bought out the Association and disperse the players. Separately, the Ottawa Senators were continued as a senior amateur team, the 'Senior Senators', taking the NHL club's place in the Ottawa Auditorium, using the same striped sweaters and 'O' logo, but play senior amateur clubs in Quebec, including those the original Ottawa HC played before the rise of professionalism in hockey. The club would continue until 1954, dissolving after crowds dwindled, citing the rise of hockey on television. The club would win the Allan Cup in 1949.\nWomen's teams.\nTeams were formed prior to 1915 at Ottawa Ladies' College and the Young Women's Christian Association, but they did not play outside teams. In 1915, the Ottawa Alerts were organized, featuring the best women's players in Ottawa. The team were immediately champions. In 1916, the club defeated the Pittsburgh Ladies Club three times in one day, then defeated Toronto the following day. The team, based at Dey's Arena was not in a league, but played exhibitions in a circuit from Montreal to Renfrew. Their first coach was Hamby Shore. In 1922–23, the Alerts won the Canadian championship. The club then passed under the sponsorship of the Ottawa Rowing Club. The team would win one more Canadian championship before it was folded in 1929. Eva Ault of the Ottawa Alerts is crediting with helping to popularize women's hockey during the early 20th century.\nWorld War II years.\nDuring the World War II years, NHL players enlisted in the war effort. A large number of them were posted to Ottawa base. This included the complete Boston Bruins 'Kraut Line'. The clubs played in the Quebec Senior Hockey League, and the Ottawa Commandos (war-time name for the Senators) and the Ottawa RCAF Flyers won the Allan Cup senior men's Canadian ice hockey championship.\nPostwar teams.\nAfter World War II, Ottawa's RCAF Flyers, a senior amateur team, played in the 1948 Winter Olympics, representing Canada and winning the gold medal. The club had won the Allan Cup in 1942.\nThe Senior Senators continued to play in the Quebec Senior Hockey League after the war. While unaffiliated with any NHL team, Senators players were often the property of the Montreal Canadiens, Toronto Maple Leafs or former Ottawa-born NHLers reinstated as amateurs. Larry Regan, future GM of the Los Angeles Kings played for the Senators before moving to the American Hockey League. The QSHL became the QHL professional league in 1953. By then, Tommy Gorman, who had owned the club when it was a member of the NHL, was back as owner of the team and the Ottawa Auditorium. In the face of national broadcasts on Saturday nights of the Canadiens and the Toronto Maple Leafs, he suspended the club in December 1954.\nAfter the Senior Senators dissolved in 1954, the senior Hull-Ottawa Canadiens were formed, an affiliate of the Montreal Canadiens, managed by future hall of famers Scotty Bowman and Sam Pollock. The club started play in the Ontario Hockey Association, and moved to the Eastern Professional Hockey League in 1959, playing four seasons before disbanding in 1963.\nMajor junior hockey.\nThe first Ottawa junior-age team to qualify for the Memorial Cup was the Ottawa Gunners of 1928, followed by the Ottawa Primroses of 1931. No teams qualified for the final until the 1950s.\nWhen the Hull-Ottawa Canadiens were formed in 1956, a junior-age team was also formed, the Ottawa Junior Canadiens. Playing as an independent team, the team played senior-level teams and other junior-age team. The team qualified twice for the Memorial Cup, in 1957 and 1958, playing for the title both times against other Montreal Canadiens-sponsored junior teams. The Junior Canadiens won the 1958 Cup to become the first Ottawa team to win the Cup. In 1959, the junior team was suspended, and some of its players joined the senior squad.\nThe 1960s saw the return of top-level junior hockey to the city. The Ottawa 67s of the OHA began play in December 1967 at the new Ottawa Civic Centre. The Civic Centre, a Centennial project, had to open during 1967 or lose its federal funding. The 67s, which had been playing in Hull, narrowly accomplished the scheduled date, playing their first game in a partially finished Civic Centre on December 29, 1967.\nThe club has remained in the Civic Centre ever since, and as of 2009, is considered one of the most successful junior franchises in Canada. The club has won the Memorial Cup and hosted the Memorial Cup tournament.\nWorld Hockey Association.\nThe Ottawa Nationals played in the WHA's inaugural season 1972–73. The team qualified for the 1973 WHA playoffs, losing in the first round. The team was not successful at the gate and left Ottawa when they could not come to terms with the City of Ottawa over the lease of the Civic Centre. They relocated the following season to Toronto, Ontario, to become the Toronto Toros; which in turn, would relocate in 1976–77 to Birmingham, Alabama, as the Birmingham Bulls. A second try in the WHA was attempted in 1976, when the Denver Spurs relocated to Ottawa to become the Ottawa Civics. The team folded after a handful of games, the final game against Gordie Howe and the Houston Aeros, played in Ottawa.\nReturn of the NHL.\nThe Senators were revived in 1990 after Bruce Firestone and Terrace Investments were granted an expansion franchise by the NHL. The Senators began play in the 1992–93 NHL season, playing their first three seasons in the Ottawa Civic Centre, while their new arena, the \"Palladium\" (now called the Canadian Tire Centre), was constructed, moving in January 1996. For their first four seasons, they were unsuccessful, finishing last in the league. In 1996, the team first qualified for the playoffs and qualified for the playoffs in eleven-straight seasons, peaking with a Stanley Cup Finals appearance in 2007, losing to the Anaheim Ducks. It had been 80 years since an Ottawa team had appeared in the Finals.\nFirestone, while ambitious, did not have the finances to support the team. The team struggled financially from the start, financing the arena and its infrastructure. A recession in the early 1990s and a low Canadian dollar put pressure on the club's finances also. When one of the club's bankers failed in the early 2000s, the Senators were forced into bankruptcy themselves. The club did not fold or relocate, instead re-emerging under the new ownership of Eugene Melnyk a multi-millionaire Canadian businessman with enough personal wealth to own the club outright. Since Melnyk took over, the club has been successful financially, bolstered by the strong play of the on-ice product and strong attendance. The club expanded the seating capacity of Scotiabank Place and built the nearby Bell Sensplex arena facility.\nAdult recreational hockey.\nOttawa plays host to nine organized adult hockey leagues throughout the city. Also known as Senior hockey leagues or Beer hockey leagues. These leagues are composed of amateur men and women starting from the age of twenty and upwards, with no restrictive age ceiling. Their target audience are adults who have a continued interest to play hockey at a recreational level following their minor hockey league careers or adults who have developed an appetite to learn a new sport. All skill levels are invited to join as most leagues have categorized divisions breaking down various competition level based on skill, age, experience and sex. (Younger players below the age of twenty are still eligible to play in minor league associations and if interested in playing organized hockey they can join leagues such as the Hockey East Ottawa Minor hockey league). All adult recreational hockey leagues in Ottawa are either privately run or run by the city and they are operated out of local arenas.\nThe costs associated to joining adult hockey leagues in Ottawa vary from league to league and they are based on the following factors: quality of ice surface, the age of the arena, time of play (peak or non-peak hours), level of arena maintenance, the services provided by organizers (referees, time keepers, live statistics tracking and prizes awarded following each game). League fees are used to pay for the ice rental and all other services described above.\nEach league has their own set of rules governing the games and enforced by the referees on the ice, but in general they are roughly based on the National hockey league rules. The various league have different requirements relating to equipment warn while playing, however most require CSA approved equipment. The main goal of these leagues is to have fun, get some exercise and spend time with friends therefore they encourage safe play and mutual respect between players and referees.\nThe majority of leagues will run two season, running leagues in the summer and winter. The summer seasons run between late Spring until mid Summer for an approximate total of 14 games. The winter seasons run between late August until mid April for a minimum of 24 games. In addition to the season games, playoffs are held at the end of the regular season and the number of games played are based on elimination and the number of games played will depend on how far you can make it through, in the end crowning a champion for each division. Winning your division championship comes with a photo with the house trophy, bragging rights and a team prize of some kind.\nRegistration to an adult recreational hockey leagues is a month before the start of the season and done through each league's unique website and it is preferable to register a full team of ten players or more plus one goalie. However most senior hockey leagues offer the option of signing up as an individual player and the league organizers will help place individuals on teams with open roster spots.\nList of current teams.\nJunior 'A'.\nNote: Seven other teams play in the Ottawa Valley and surrounding area: Brockville Braves, Carleton Place Canadians, Cornwall Colts, Hawkesbury Hawks, Kemptville 73's, Pembroke Lumber Kings, and Smiths Falls Bears."

In a Boston Globe profile (July 12, 2007) of Russ Adams regarding his July 2007 induction into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, Billie Jean King stated: \"Russ is a national treasure.\" \"He's our dean, our guru, our guardian. Believe me, the players look for him and love him,\" King added.\nHe covered the sport for 50 years and created associated tennis photography rules. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island in July 2007 along with players Pete Sampras, Arantxa Sánchez Vicario, and Sven Davidson.\nAdams spent the last 50 years of his life visually documenting the history of tennis at over 400 events. He is the face behind the camera and his work has illuminated the greatest moments and stories in the sport.\nAdams photographed Grand Slam Tournaments, the World Championship Tour (WCT), all major United States Tennis Association (USTA) tournaments, Fed Cup, Davis Cup, and tennis at the Olympic Games. Watch five video vignettes about the Australian Open that show Russ and highlight his work, produced and aired by The Tennis Channel, that ran on TV during this year's tournament.\nAdams credited learning tennis photographer from 17-time Grand Slam Champion, the \"Queen Mother of American Tennis\", Hazel Wightman, at Longwood Cricket Club in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, where Wightman was a member.\nIn 1967 he became the official (volunteer) photographer of the U.S. National Championship at Forest Hills. At the birth of Open Tennis he developed and implemented the system for on-court photographers at the 1969 U.S. Open Championship in tandem with the tournament director Bill Talbert. He served as director/liaison of photographers for the U.S. Open, and was instrumental in developing the universal \"Code of Conduct\" in conjunction with the Professional Tennis Council to be used by photographers covering tennis events around the world. He was a founding member of the International Tennis Federation Media Commission and served on the Board for 17 years.\nAdams's collection of tennis images was considered the largest privately held source of images in the tennis world. \"His portfolio of photos is probably the most comprehensive volume chronicling the game of tennis from its professional infancy,\" stated fellow International Tennis Hall of Famer Jim Courier in a Northeast Tennis Magazine (Summer 2007) cover profile of Adams.\nAdams died on June 28, 2017, at age 86."

Arnold Palmer finished in fourth and Gary Player finished tied for 6th, while Sam Snead and Ben Hogan, both age 54, finished tied for 10th.

It was later equaled by Player in 1978 and Jack Nicklaus in 1986; both shot 30 on the back nine on Sunday to win by a stroke. The record stood until Mark Calcavecchia shot 29 on the back nine in 1992 (David Toms also shot a 29 on the back nine in 1998). This was Hogan's final appearance in the Masters; his last major was two months later at the U.S. Open. For Snead, a three-time champion, it marked his final top ten finish at Augusta; he participated into the 1980s.\nIt was also the last Masters for three-time champion Jimmy Demaret as a participant, who missed the cut by four strokes. He won the Masters in 1940, 1947, and 1950, but had not played in the other three majors since 1958.\nTwo-time defending champion Nicklaus shot a nine-bogey 79 in the second round and missed the cut by one stroke, the first defending champion not to play on the weekend. (The 36-hole cut at Augusta was introduced a decade earlier, in 1957.) It was his only missed cut at the Masters from 1960 through 1993 (withdrew before 2nd round in 1983); he missed the cut by a stroke in his first appearance in 1959 at age 19. Nicklaus regrouped and won the next major, the U.S. Open at Baltusrol. With the missed cut, Nicklaus failed to qualify for the Ryder Cup team, the first for which he was eligible. He had been in a minor slump and only became eligible in mid-1966, more than halfway through the two-year qualifying cycle, His win in the previous Masters did not count for the Ryder Cup as it was prior to his full PGA of America membership and it was the era prior to captains' picks.\nArnold Palmer won the eighth Par 3 contest with a score of 23.

        "title": "1997 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 1997 State of Origin series was the 16th year that the annual best-of-three series of interstate rugby league football matches between the Queensland and New South Wales representative teams was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. Like the 1995 State of Origin series, players from clubs aligned with Super League were not eligible for selection. Gone were established players Laurie Daley, Allan Langer, Ricky Stuart, Wendell Sailor, Glenn Lazarus, Bradley Clyde, Gorden Tallis and Kevin Walters - all representing their respective states in the newly invented Super League Tri-series.\nFor the Australian Rugby League loyalists, younger talent in Andrew Johns, Matt Sing, Ben Ikin, Adrian Lam, Trent Barrett, Steve Menzies and Robbie O'Davis all came of age in 1997. Fought out against the backdrop of public disillusion and a game bitterly divided due to the Super League war, 1997's was a dour series. The spirit was there, and some new faces, but the intensity wasn't quite the same. The New South Wales camp was brightened with the arrival of one of Australian rugby league's traditional and colourful characters in Tommy Raudonikis as coach who guided New South Wales to their fifth series win in six years on the back of the strong legacy left by Raudonikis' predecessor coach Phil Gould.\nGame I.\nTommy Raudonikis' Blues gained the ascendency in game I - a match lacking the traditional early Origin intensity but which came alive in the second half as the prospect of a New South Wales triumph became reality. The Blues lead 8-0 at half-time after a try to Paul McGregor in the 31st minute and a goal each to Rod Wishart and Andrew Johns.\nInjuries conspired against the visitors with McGregor, Wishart and Johns all forced from the field and sensing vulnerability the Maroons surged back. Queensland dominated the second-half but the Blues defence held out. Eventually weight of possession told and the Blues were cut to a 2-point lead when Maroons debutant Adrian Lam - a Papua New Guinean representative given dispensation to play Origin since 1995 - scored in the 68th minute.\nNew South Wales' brave and nuggety hooker Geoff Toovey lifted for the occasion and in the last ten minutes made a series of probing darts which kept the Maroons on the back foot and which earned him man-of-the-match honours and victory for the Blues.\nGame II.\nIn the 50th State of Origin match played, New South Wales looked to have wrapped up Game II by racing to a 14-0 lead after just 27 minutes via tries to Ken McGuinness, Nik Kosef and Jim Dymock. However Queensland kept their cool and reduced the deficit to 14-10 at halftime with two tries in four minutes to Matt Sing and Robbie O'Davis.\nThe Maroons levelled the scores five minutes after the break when Brett Dallas broke a Jamie Ainscough tackle and crossed for 14-all. There were no further points in a classic tight contest until the 69th minute when Blues half John Simon landed a 26-metre field goal. The Queensland camp was left to rue a missed penalty attempt by Julian O'Neill in the dying minutes, presenting NSW victory and their fifth series win in six years.\nGame III.\nGame III was dead rubber with only pride and soul at stake for the Maroons who were facing their second consecutive whitewash.\nQueensland were outstanding on the night at the Blues' home ground and broke a five-game losing streak to win 18-12. Ben Ikin was the Maroons' hero, scoring a superb solo try after just four minutes and then firing a pass for Julian O'Neill to extend the Queensland lead to 12-0 at the 13-minute mark. New South Wales came back with tries to Ainscough and Johns but a Mark Coyne try sealed the victory for the Maroons.\nWith Queensland leading 6-0 following Ikin's try, there were a number of spiteful incidents. Queensland front rower Clinton O'Brien was all but knocked out attempting to tackle Blues prop Mark Carroll, while rival hookers Andrew Johns and Jamie Goddard also traded punches. Then from a scrum near half way, Carroll flattened replacement Maroons prop Craig Smith (who had only just come on for O'Brien), while Johns and Goddard continued their private war with Johns actually running around one of the touch judges to continue the fight, though the issue was soon put beyond doubt when Goddard landed a right hand that put the future rugby league Immortal on the deck and requiring stitches from a split lip. Referee Eddie Ward soon restored order to the game, penalising Carroll for the scrum blow up while sending both Johns and Goddard to the sin-bin, while Johns was also placed on report."

        "title": "1981 State of Origin game",
        "text": "The 1981 State of Origin game was the second such match between arch rivals Queensland and New South Wales to be played under State of Origin selection rules. Again it was played as the third game of an already-decided 3-game series. New South Wales' victories in the first two games under the \"state of residency\" selection rules were, however, the last matches of this kind to ever be played as the following year the Origin concept was fully embraced.\nThe match featured a stunning comeback by the Maroons, an all-in-brawl, a 95-metre try by Eric Grothe, Sr. and the second consecutive man-of-the-match performance from Queensland centre, Chris Close.\nBackground.\nDespite the success of the 1980 State of Origin game, there was still opposition to the game going ahead from certain parts of the Sydney media. One who had opposed the game the year before, \"The Daily Mirror's\" Ron Casey, was still against the concept and wrote \"It's a mark of the lack of sophistication of Brisbane football fans that they will accept as serious football the State of Origin match on Tuesday week. Its just an excuse for 30,000 fans to see top footballers thrown together for a Lang Park Roman Holiday. The game will prove nothing except that Brisbane is the only place in the world that would take it seriously.\"\nThough it seemed that it wasn't just the media who opposed the game. In a column in the \"Sunday Telegraph\", NSW and Australian centre Steve Rogers wrote: \"\"And while we are on the State of Origin match, I hope it is canned this year. The players have enough representative football this season with the tour by France. The players don't relish the thought of the match and to put it on after a side has toured here is a bit hard\".\" For Rogers, the NSW captain, the Origin game (played on July 28) would be his 7th game in 24 days having played in the two tests against France as well as four games for his club team Cronulla-Sutherland since July 4.\nMatch report.\nWith rugby league officials from NSW still not convinced of the State of Origin format, the 1980 model was repeated in 1981 when the first two matches were played under the old residential selection criteria. With the confidence gained from the 1980 Origin win, the Queensland residents were more competitive than they had been in years, losing 10–2 at Lang Park and 22–9 at Leichhardt Oval, with New South Wales taking the series before the third match reverted to the new Origin selection criteria and the intensity again picked up.\nQueensland chose to call on only four Sydney-based players for the game - winger Mitch Brennan from South Sydney, second-rower Paul McCabe from Easts and front-rowers Rod Morris (Balmain) and Paul Khan (Cronulla). Maroons captain-coach Arthur Beetson, who was seeing out his playing days at age 36 with Redcliffe, had been in fine form for the two residential clashes, but pulled out with an eye injury on the day of the match, giving the Queensland captaincy to 21-year-old five-eighth Wally Lewis. Beetson later told the real reason he pulled out of the game was that he had lost the motivation to keep playing representative football after being overlooked for the test series against France. Beetson was reportedly in line for his first test since the 1977 World Cup, but NSWRL and ARL boss Kevin Humphreys voted against Beetson's selection with a view to the future and the Kangaroo Tour to be held at the end of 1982. Humphreys felt that at 36 Beetson had nothing left to offer the test side.\nNSW had originally selected South Sydney's Michael Pattison to play , but had fallen ill before the team left Sydney and the flight at altitude had caused a middle-ear infection that forced him to withdraw. Pattison spent the game on the sidelines compiling stats for Channel 7 (Sydney) sideline reporter Barry Ross. Selectors then chose young Western Suburbs player Terry Lamb as his replacement and rushed him to Brisbane on the afternoon of the game. This was against the wishes of coach Ted Glossop who wanted to move Steve Rogers to the halves, Phil Sigsworth to the centres, bring in Garry Dowling as fullback and play Lamb from the bench. The team actually trained in those positions on the morning of the game before Lamb arrived and according to Glossop, Rogers trained very well at pivot and combined well with Qld born Peter Sterling who was making his Origin debut for the Blues. Glossop later recounted that he was told of Lamb's selection immediately after training and even then thought of going his own way until told the NSWRL insisted that Lamb play 5/8 and Rogers was not play anywhere but in the centres.\nParramatta Eels halfback Sterling, who had represented City Seconds earlier in the season, was a surprise choice over incumbent test halfback Steve Mortimer who had made his test debut a few weeks earlier against France. Mortimer reportedly paid the price for the Australia's less than convincing 17–2 second test win against the weak French at Lang Park despite having led Australia to a comprehensive 43–2 win in the first test at the Sydney Cricket Ground where he scored two tries on debut. The Canterbury-Bankstown halfback, who had played in the two State of Residence games that had preceded both the French tests and the Origin game, described his demotion as \"A nice kick in the guts.\"\nOpposing props Rod Morris and Newtown's Steve Bowden clashed in an early tackle, following an errant elbow from Bowden, and punches were thrown. In the ensuing melee, Lewis sought out Terry Lamb and gave him a rugged welcome to interstate football with a number of uppercuts. After 7 minutes of play, the next scrum erupted into a brawl with Bowden and Morris singled out by referee Kevin Steele as the chief instigators, with both then sent to the sin-bin for 10 minutes (though replays indicated that Morris had done most of the punching with Bowden unusually restrained) with NSW receiving a penalty. In that period the Blues raced to a 15–0 lead thanks to their Parramatta connection of Peter Sterling, Ray Price, Eric Grothe and Mick Cronin, with Price and Sterling setting up one try for Grothe and another for Cronin (all four players would later that year feature in the Eels' inaugural premiership victory). This was the second of Grothe's tries for the game, the first came after 13 minutes when he swooped upon a wayward pass by Maroons' hooker Greg Conescu and raced 95-metres down the touchline, easily out pacing his opposite number Mitch Brennan and Qld halfback Ross Henrick before busting through the cover defending tackles of Brad Backer (coming from the opposite wing) and Colin Scott to score in the corner to give the Blues a 5–0 lead after Cronin's sideline conversion. Backer's tackle had actually caused Grothe to fall and he looked to have stopped less than half a metre short, but Scott's subsequent effort hitting the Blues winger as he hit the ground actually dragged him over the line for the try. Soon after Price sent Sterling through a big gap in the defence and he found Cronin backing up on his outside to score. After Cronin converted his own try, NSW led 10–0 after just 16 minutes. Grothe scored his second try moments later after Henrick was penalised for not retiring behind a scrum. A simple run-around move saw Sterling pass to Price who sent his winger bursting through a weak Chris Phelan tackle to score under the posts.\nWith the score 15–0 after less than 20 minutes it looked like the days of old with NSW dominating. However, Queensland's defence stiffened, and they took back some momentum just before half-time when winger Backer grabbed a try in the corner off a long pass from McCabe to make it 15–5. NSW had been running the ball our from their own line but lost possession when second rower Les Boyd, thinking he was a decoy runner and not paying attention, didn't realise the ball was being thrown to him. The ball bounced forward off his hip and was regathered by Queensland who scored through Backer just 3 tackles later.\nFollowing the break, new Queensland captain Wally Lewis sparked a second-half Maroons revival when he stepped past Sterling and went on a long, diagonal run, breaking a late attempt at tackle by Ray Price to score a dazzling (and much-replayed) individual try. Barry Ross told television viewers that Lewis had told him earlier in the day that he was motivated to play well after receiving criticism from the Sydney media for both his selection in the Australian team and his supposedly lacklustre form in the tests against France. The media had wanted City and NSW state of residence games five-eighth Robert Laurie in the test team instead of Lewis who they felt was only selected to give the Queensland Rugby League a player in the team. There were 5 Queenslanders in the first test team, but Lewis was the only one not playing in the Sydney premiership.\nMinutes after the restart came an enduring moment that has become part of Origin folklore. Queensland fullback Colin Scott received a pass from Lewis off the scrum near halfway and split the defence, bursting past NSW captain Steve Rogers in a 55-metre charge that ended just short of the line thanks to a despairing tackle by Grothe (who had started almost 10 metres behind Scott when he started the chase, showcasing his speed as Scott was no slouch). Grothe clung to Scott's ankles as he waited for his teammates to get back in defence, but in a now-famous image, Maroons centre Chris Close grabbed Grothe's hair before backhanding him out of the way. Close then picked up the ball from dummy-half and dived through Steve Rogers tackle to score next to the posts. Other NSW players would later claim they hung back from tackling Close as they expected to receive a penalty for the back hander and were surprised when it never came (there were claims that Grothe had injured himself when he tackled Scott, though Close disputes this saying he first yelled at Grothe to let go before back handing him when he didn't move). Mal Meninga converted to take the score to 15-all.\nThe momentum was now fully with Queensland and with 5 minutes remaining frustrated Blues lock Ray Price appeared to head-butt Queensland lock Chris Phelan in the play the ball, 20 metres out right in front of the posts. He was penalised and Meninga's kick put the Maroons in front for the first time in the game. In the final moments of the game with Qld again attacking the NSW line as they had done for most of the second half, Meninga grubber kicked the ball into the NSW in-goal and gave chase, but he was tackled without the ball by Steve Rogers before he could get to it causing referee Steele to award Qld a penalty try. Meninga converted from in front to complete Queensland's victory, setting a standard of expectation for miraculous Queensland comebacks that has been met time and time again in subsequent contests.\nTeams.\nQueensland Team.\nOf Queensland's fifteen players used, four were selected from New South Wales clubs."

Unlike in England and Wales, where a pyramid system of 4 regions and a Premier above exists, the Scottish system is separate. However, Scottish universities do receive places in the end of season knock-out tournaments which decide overall British champions (see individual division entries below).

Coverage of the amateur game is also included, along with local and international rugby league related news.\nHistory.\nThe current incarnation of this publication is a merger of two previously existing titles, 'Rugby Leaguer' which can trace its origins back to the 1940s, and 'League Express', which first appeared on Monday 10 September 1990.\nLeague Express.\nIn 1990, Martyn Sadler (chairman) and Tim Butcher (managing director) believed that limited coverage of rugby league every Monday morning in the national newspapers had opened a niche market for a specialist rugby league newspaper to be published every Monday. The very first edition of League Express, edited by Mike Rylance, appeared on 10 September 1990. The first six editions of League Express were printed by the Yorkshire Weekly Newspaper Group at their Wakefield printing press, before production was transferred to Bradford, to the Telegraph and Argus press.\nAt the start of the 1993/94 season Martyn Sadler became the managing editor of League Express. LPL decided to expand its production with a new title – League Express Weekend – edited by Tim Butcher and published each Friday during the season. In the years that followed, the Friday newspaper changed its title to Rugby League Weekend, Super League Week, and then Total Rugby League.\nAt the end of the 2000 season League Publications Limited decided to convert its Total Rugby League newspaper into an online publication, TotalRL.com, which launched on 1 March 2001 and became one of the world's most popular rugby league sites.\nRugby Leaguer &amp; League Express.\nIn May 2002, League Publications Limited acquired the 'Rugby Leaguer' newspaper and merged it with League Express to create \"Rugby Leaguer &amp; League Express\".\nIn 2008, the Albert Goldthorpe Medal, named after Albert Goldthorpe, was created by the newspaper to honour the leading players in the Super League.\nStaff.\nEditor: Martyn Sadler\nAssistant editor: Lorraine Marsden\nSenior reporter: Doug Thomson\nProduction editor: Dan Spencer\nCartoonist: Honor James"

Running back Brent Moss of Wisconsin was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game.\nPre-game activities.\nOn Tuesday, October 19, 1993, Tournament of Roses Interim President Michael E. Ward selected 18-year-old Erica Beth Brynes, a senior at Arcadia High School and a resident of Arcadia, as the 76th Rose Queen, to reign over the 105th Rose Parade and the 80th Rose Bowl Game.\nThe game was presided over by the 1994 Tournament of Roses Royal Court and Rose Parade Grand Marshal William Shatner. The Royal Court was led by Queen Erica and consisted of six rose princesses: Nicole Bangar, South Pasadena; Therese Erdman, Arcadia; Shannon Hall, San Marino; Sabrina Prud'homme, Altadena; Shannon Sheldon, San Marino; and Jennifer Trayner, San Marino.\nBefore the game, Chris Farley gave Wisconsin's “motivational speech” playing his popular Saturday Night Live character, Matt Foley.\nTeams.\nWisconsin Badgers.\nIn the final game of the season, Wisconsin defeated Michigan State in the last Coca-Cola Classic to secure a conference co-championship. The Badgers' sole loss was to Minnesota by a score of 21–28 in their annual rivalry game.\nOhio State lost to Michigan, 28–0, in their annual rivalry game. Wisconsin and Ohio State ended the season with identical 9–1–1 records with 6–1–1 conference records, and tied when they met during the season in a game at Camp Randall (college football would not adopt \"overtime\" to resolve ties in regulation until the 1996 season). Wisconsin and Ohio State were co-champions of the Big Ten Conference. Wisconsin won the Rose Bowl invitation tiebreaker due to Big Ten rules which resolved first-place ties by eliminating the most recent invitee: Wisconsin had last been to the Rose Bowl in 1963, while Ohio State was in the 1985 Rose Bowl.\nUCLA Bruins.\nUCLA opened the season with two close losses: 25–27 against California, and 13–14 against Nebraska. The Bruins then won seven in a row, including a win over #7 Arizona. They lost 3–9 against Arizona State. The 1993 UCLA–USC rivalry game had the Pac-10 championship and the Rose Bowl berth on the line for both the Bruins and the Trojans. UCLA won 27–21 at the Coliseum. Arizona was tied for first, but did not receive the Rose Bowl invitation because of the head-to-head loss at UCLA. This was coach Terry Donahue's last Rose Bowl appearance.\nGame summary.\nThe weather was 73 degrees and hazy. UCLA receiver J. J. Stokes set Rose Bowl records for receptions (14) and receiving yards (176). Brent Moss gashed the UCLA defense for 158 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns.\nScoring.\nThird quarter.\nNo Scoring"

Michigan scored the final two touchdowns to win by seven points, avenging the previous year's loss and foiling the Huskies' attempt at a third straight Rose Bowl title. MVP Tyrone Wheatley scored three touchdowns and rushed for 235 yards on just 15 carries \nMichigan finished the season undefeated (with three ties) at 9–0–3, ranked #5 in the final polls. Washington (9–3) was ranked #1 in early November at 8-0, but losses to Arizona and Washington State, along with this one, dropped them to #11 (AP) and #10 (Coaches) in the final national rankings.\nThis turned out to be Don James' last game as the Huskies' head coach. He resigned in protest shortly before the beginning of the next season after the NCAA and Pac-10 levied sanctions against Washington for rules violations."

He played 106 games in the National Hockey League with the Minnesota North Stars between 1976 and 1979. The rest of his career, which lasted from 1976 to 1980, was spent in various minor leagues.\nCareer.\nBorn in Toronto, Roberts grew up in Proton Station, Ontario (now a part of Southgate) near Flesherton, Ontario. He attended Grey Highlands Secondary School and played hockey for local teams until he was old enough to move up to Junior B hockey.\nRoberts's junior hockey career started with the 1972–73 Owen Sound Greys of the Mid-Ontario Junior B Hockey League. With the help of Roberts, the Greys won their league championship. The Greys eventually came within a win of defeating the Toronto Nationals, which would have given them the chance to win the Sutherland Cup as provincial champions. The next season saw him move up to the Ottawa 67's of the Ontario Major Junior Hockey League. In three seasons with the 67's, Roberts tabulated 62 goals and 176 points in 188 regular seasons games.\nIn 1976, after three seasons with the 67's, Roberts was drafted 31st overall by the Minnesota North Stars in the 1976 NHL Amateur Draft. The same year, Roberts was also drafted 34th overall by the Houston Aeros in the 1976 WHA Amateur Draft. Roberts started the 1976–77 season off in the American Hockey League with the New Haven Nighthawks, but after ten games was brought up to play with the Stars for the rest of the season. Roberts split the 1977–78 season between the North Stars and the Central Hockey League's Fort Worth Texans and split the 1978–79 season between the North Stars and the CHL's Oklahoma City Stars. At the end of the season, the North Stars left Roberts unprotected and he was picked up by the Winnipeg Jets in the 1979 NHL Expansion Draft; however, he never played another game in the National Hockey League. In 106 National Hockey League games, Roberts scored 17 goals and had 23 assists with 33 penalty minutes, all with the Minnesota North Stars.\nIn 1979–80, Roberts jumped from the Tulsa Oilers to the Cincinnati Stingers of the CHL and Maine Mariners of the AHL before retiring from professional hockey at the end of the season. Afterwards, he returned to the Flesherton area and played senior hockey for the Ontario Hockey Association's Durham Huskies for several years. He was also added to the Cambridge Hornets roster in February 1983 and was a valuable contributor to the team winning the 1982-83 Allan Cup."

        "text": "The Scottish Regional Leagues are the lowest levels of the Scottish rugby union system. They consist of three regions:\nUnlike the Premiership, National League and parts of the League Championship, which were formed in 1973 and have remained roughly the same since, the Regional Leagues have grown over time, in a process which saw the old District Leagues amalgamated into the national structure. Up to and including season 2006–07, some divisions operated pools (where the division was split in two, with pre-Christmas and post-Christmas mini-groups) but from season 2007–08 all the divisions will be standard all-play-all formats of between 10 and 12 clubs.\nFrom season 2012–13 the whole League was revamped into a pyramid structure. The 6 National Divisions were scrapped because of travel costs and lack of movement between leagues. The new leagues were:\nThe Caledonia Leagues were then broken down again into Midlands, North-East and North-West for travel cost reasons. For season 2014–15, Championship divisions A &amp; B were scrapped and two additional National League divisions were re-introduced under National League Division 1.\nThe champion from each league would be promoted to replace the bottom team of the corresponding division. Also two-legged play-offs were introduced at the end of each season for the 2nd placed team and 2nd bottom team of the higher league. The winner over two legs would play in the higher league the next season, meaning greater potential movement throughout the divisions.\nHistory.\nUp to season 1972–73, Scotland's rugby union clubs participated in what was known as an 'unofficial championship'. It provided very unbalanced competition: some clubs played more fixtures than others and some fixture lists provided stiffer opposition than others. The resulting league table at the end of each season gave a very unbalanced and difficult-to-comprehend set of results.\nStarting in season 1973–74, the Scottish Rugby Union organised the full member clubs into six leagues. Though the SRU's administrators were often seen as backward looking, Scotland had a national league before England, Wales or Ireland. Since the advent of the leagues, the Scottish Rugby Union and its member clubs have re-organised the competition several times, usually to change the number of teams.\nThe current Regional Leagues are based more on political than physical geography. The Caledonia region covers a much larger area and more clubs but a smaller population. The East region is made up of the City of Edinburgh, the Lothians and the Borders, traditionally the strongest rugby playing regions. The West region is based on the old Strathclyde council region, from the South-West English border, through Ayrshire, Lanarkshire, Glasgow and suburbs North to Stirlingshire. The Caledonia Region covers the whole North of Scotland from Fife and Stirling, all the way to Orkney and Eilean Siar. It is sub-divided (in leagues 2 and 3) into Midlands, North and North-West.\nTennents West Regional League 2021-2022.\nIn League One, with the exception of Carrick the teams remained the same as the 2019-20 season, due to the covid 19 pandemic. In League Three, the Isle of Mull RFC moved to non-league status.\nCaledonia Regional League, 2021–22.\n2nd and 3rd XVs not included."

        "title": "Duquesne Dukes men's basketball",
        "text": "The Duquesne Dukes represent Duquesne University in college basketball. The team, which started in 1914, has only ever played in NCAA Division I and has had six appearances in the NCAA Tournament. The Dukes play in the Atlantic 10 Conference, of which they have been members since 1976 (minus the 1992–93 season in which the Dukes were single-season members of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference). Their head basketball coach is Dru Joyce III.\nThe Dukes men's basketball team has had great success over the years, playing twice in national championship games in the 1950s and winning the National Invitation Tournament championship in 1955. Duquesne also emerged victorious in the 1976–77 Eastern Collegiate Basketball League (the forerunner to the Eastern Athletic Association, now known as the Atlantic 10 Conference) tournament and 2024 Atlantic 10 tournament. The Dukes were also 1979–80 and 1980–81 Eastern Athletic Association regular-season co-champions. The Associated Press ranked Duquesne as the No. 1 college basketball team in the country for two consecutive weeks during the 1953–54 season. They also have gone through lean years, as Duquesne went 47 years between appearances in the NCAA Division I Tournament (which was the eighth-longest active streak) after winning their first Atlantic 10 title in 1977. They reached (and lost) the A10 tournament final in 1981 and 2009 before finally winning the conference tournament in 2024 and snapping the 47-year appearance drought in the NCAA tournament.\nDuquesne is the only school to have back-to-back first overall picks in the National Basketball Association draft (Dick Ricketts by the Saint Louis Hawks in 1955 and Sihugo Green by the Rochester Royals in 1956). The Dukes men's basketball program can also claim the first African-American player selected in an NBA draft (Chuck Cooper by the Boston Celtics in 1950). The 1939–40 Dukes basketball team finished with a 20–3 record and appeared in the Final Four of both the NIT and NCAA Tournaments. Duquesne has had the most Atlantic 10 scoring champions in conference history.\nHistory.\nEarly history.\nThe history of basketball at Duquesne University can be dated back to 1914, when the university administration established basketball as a varsity sport. The first game, against Bethany College, was won in a gym under the college chapel on January 9, 1914 (Rishel 23). The team was first coached by Alexander Hogarty, whose tenure lasted only one season. The position was filled by Father Eugene McGuigan, who was called \"Father Mac\" on campus and \"Coach Gene Martin\" in newspaper reports in order to prevent the name of a Holy Ghost father from being associated with the rowdiness of \"Basket-ball\". Father McGuigan coached football, baseball, and basketball until he was transferred from Duquesne University in 1923 (Rishel 38).\nWhen a proper gymnasium was constructed in 1923, Duquesne Basketball was finally allowed to come into its own, as the previous court was in reality a stage below the chapel and was not only slanted but demarcated by a steel cage on its perimeter. Teams had previously refused to play the \"Bluffites\" on their home court. Coach \"Chick\" Davies initiated a new era in the basketball program, filling the 1,200-seat gymnasium and bringing the team into national prominence. In its first season with Davies, Duquesne tied with Waynesburg University for the Tri-State Conference championship and dominated the same conference in 1926 and 1927 before moving to a higher level of competition. The season expanded from 20 to 28 games and became more competitive in 1930 when the team faced the University of Iowa, Loyola University Chicago, Adrian College, Elmhurst College, Alfred State College, John Carroll University, American University, Catholic University, Colgate University, St. Bonaventure University, Seton Hall University, Manhattan College, and the City College of New York. Davies, immensely popular, coached Duquesne basketball until 1948 (Rishel 40–41).\nWorld War II era.\nThe university tried to hold on to basketball during World War II, having reworked the gymnasium in 1942 to seat an extra 800 spectators, but was forced to drop the sport at the end of the 1943 season (Rishel 81–82). However, the sport was reinstated in the spring of 1946. During the 1946–1947 season Davies led the Dukes to 19 straight victories before a loss to Georgetown University. In that same season, Duquesne received its third invitation to the NIT, losing by one point to the University of Utah, the eventual champion, which it had defeated during the regular season (Rishel 101).\nDuring this first postwar season, the University of Tennessee refused to play a scheduled game against Duquesne at the McKeesport (PA) Vocational High School because the Dukes had a black player--Chuck Cooper. The December 23, 1946, game had been highly anticipated since Tennessee had two All-Americans and four other returning lettermen. As Davies refused to remove Cooper from the squad, Tennessee canceled at the last minute. In 1950, Cooper became the first African-American drafted to play professional basketball when he joined the Boston Celtics (Rishel 101).\nMid-century success.\nDukes Basketball continued to impress with a new coach in the 1948–49 season--Donald \"Dudey\" Moore, who had also played for Duquesne. In the 1949–50 season, Moore's team achieved a 17–5 record in the 1948–49 season, and in 1950, 23 wins and another bid to the NIT. By the 1950s, Duquesne's Locust Street gym had become inadequate to seat the team's spectators, so games were usually played in a high school gym in McKeesport or the Duquesne Gardens in Oakland. Even at this point, daily practice was held at North Catholic High School (Rishel 102).\nThe 1950s marked an age of immense success for Dukes Basketball, with Moore leading his team to six NIT bids (1950, 1952, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1956). The team went 21–1 during the 1951–52 regular season and was the top seed in the tournament. Moore was named \"Coach of the Year\" by the New York Basketball Writers Association. In 1953, Duquesne was rated as a preseason \"best in the East\" and possibly the nation. With a 23–2 record, they were top seed for the NIT that year. Although they lost to the College of the Holy Cross, they achieved a new record of 26 victories in a season. Top-seeded again in '54, Duquesne, following a 19–4 regular season, finally won the title of NIT Champions in 1955 (Rishel 137–138).\nThe 1956 season almost came to an early end, as the Duquesne Gardens, then Duquesne's home court, was to be demolished. However, in a gesture which athletic director Doc Skender called \"one of the finest acts of sportsmanship I've ever known,\" long-standing rival the University of Pittsburgh allowed the Dukes use of the Fitzgerald Field House for home games (Rishel 138).\nCoach Red Manning, initially unpopular, soon led the Dukes to another era of postseason play, ending up in the Final Four in the 1962 NIT tournament, with further appearances in the NIT in 1964, 1968, and 1970, plus appearances in the NCAA Tournament in 1969 and 1971.\nNotable in this decade was Willie Somerset, nicknamed by the press as \"Wonderful Willie.\" Though only 5'11\", he could jump higher than any other player on the team (Rishel 177).\n1970s to 1990s.\nThe 1970s saw the end of Manning's tenure. Duquesne had seen only four different basketball coaches in fifty years, but this decade alone saw three coaches: Red Manning, John Cinicola, and Mike Rice. The decade was relatively lackluster, although it saw the likes of \"the greatest guard in Duquesne basketball history\"--Norm Nixon (Rishel 216). The 1980s were marked by problems with many players' academic eligibility—calling into question the university's recruiting and support procedures—and are best described as \"trying times\" for the Dukes (Rishel 246). There were only two winning seasons in the decade--'80–81 and '85–86. Even so, the 1988 construction of the A. J. Palumbo Center—Duquesne Basketball's current home—is a notable event of this time period.\n21st century.\nThe Dukes have had mixed success in the 21st century, reaching one NCAA Tournament (reaching the second round in 2024), one NIT Tournament (eliminated in the first round in 2009) and four College Basketball Invitational tournaments (twice making the second round). Despite coming off a second straight winning season and losing to Temple in the Atlantic 10 Conference Championship Game in 2009, coach Ron Everhart was fired after the 2011–2012 season; the university cited a lack of postseason success as the main reason for the firing. Jim Ferry was hired but failed to improve the team's performance and was fired in 2017 with an overall record of 60-97. Keith Dambrot was hired away from Akron and coached the team to a bid in the 2024 NCAA Tournament as an 11 seed after winning the Atlantic 10 Conference Tournament for the second time. They defeated the 6th-seeded BYU Cougars in the first round 71-67, their first NCAA tournament win in 55 years.\nPostseason.\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Dukes have appeared in the NCAA Tournament six times. Their combined record is 5–6.\nNIT results.\nThe Dukes have appeared in the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) 17 times. Their combined record is 17–19. They were NIT champions in 1955.\nCBI results.\nThe Dukes have appeared in the College Basketball Invitational (CBI) four times. Their combined record is 2–4.\nNational Campus Basketball Tournament results.\nThe Dukes appeared in the only National Campus Basketball Tournament. Their record is 0–1.\nRetired numbers.\nOn January 27, 2001, during the halftime of a game against Xavier University, the Duquesne University Department of Athletics retired the jersey numbers of five of its all-time greatest players: Chuck Cooper, Sihugo Green, Norm Nixon, Dick Ricketts and Willie Somerset. Mike James' number 13 was retired in 2017.\nNotable players.\nAll-Americans\nProfessional"

        "title": "Mount Hood climbing accidents",
        "text": "Mount Hood climbing accidents are incidents related to mountain climbing or hiking on Oregon's Mount Hood. As of 2007, about 10,000 people attempt to climb the mountain each year. As of May 2002, more than 130 people are known to have died climbing Mount Hood since records have been kept. One of the worst climbing accidents occurred in 1986, when seven high school students and two teachers froze to death while attempting to retreat from a storm.\nDespite a quadrupling of forest visitors since 1990, the number of people requiring rescue remains steady at around 25 to 50 per year, largely because of the increased use of cell phones and GPS devices. In 2006, 3.4 percent of search and rescue missions were for mountain climbers. In comparison, 20% were for vehicles (including ATVs and snowmobiles), 3% were for mushroom collectors, the remaining 73.6 percent were for skiers, boaters, and participants in other mountain activities.\nRegardless of route, Mount Hood is a technical climb. It requires ropes, crampons, and ice axes. Approximately 95% of Mount Hood's climbs occur during the period of April through July.\nHazards.\nCascade Range weather patterns can be deceptive, with sudden sustained winds of , and visibility quickly dropping from hundreds of miles to an arm's length; climbers can experience temperature drops in less than an hour after leaving an access point. This pattern is responsible for the most well-known incidents of May 1986 and December 2006.\nAvalanches are popularly believed a major climbing hazard, but relatively few Mount Hood deaths are attributed to them. For the 11-year period ending April 2006, there was one death on Mount Hood caused by an avalanche,\nwhile 445 avalanche-related deaths occurred throughout North America.\nCompared to other western states, Oregon has relatively few avalanche fatalities (16 of the 1009 for the U.S. from 1951 to 2015).\nThere are between 100 and 200 deaths each year worldwide from avalanches.\nIn the United States from 1947 to 2018, \"2,799 people were reported to be involved in mountaineering accidents\" and 2% of these total accidents occurred on Mount Hood.\nThe two most common causes of fatal climbing incidents on Mount Hood are falls and hypothermia.\nIncident history.\nFrom 1890 through 1990.\nAccording to \"Mount Hood: A Complete History\" by Jack Grauer,\nthe first recorded climbing fatality on Hood's slopes occurred on July 12, 1896, when Frederic Kirn eschewed his guide and attempted the trip to the summit alone. Kirn's body was found on the Newton Clark Glacier on the east side of the mountain, after an apparent 40-story fall in connection with an avalanche.\nIn an unusual accident reported in Grauer's book, on August 27, 1934, Victor Von Norman successfully climbed the mountain via the southern route, along with a group of fellow University of Washington students. He then ventured too close to a fumarole between Crater Rock and the \"Hogsback\" that connects Crater Rock with the summit ridge, was overcome by oxygen-barren gases emanating from the fumarole, and fell about to his death. A number of men who tried to retrieve the body over several days were also nearly overcome by the fumes, even after obtaining an oxygen mask, before finally succeeding in their efforts.\nIn 1961, experienced climber, Colin Chisholm, and his teenage son, Doug, climbed the Eliot Glacier. During the descent of Cooper Spur, a crampon slipped on ice, causing a fall. The two fell on Eliot Glacier. Colin broke his ribs and Doug was unharmed. Their route became known as \"The Chisholm Trail\".\nOn March 1, 1969, James Eaton died when he fell headfirst into a concealed crevasse near the edge of the upper portion of the White River Canyon. Eaton was a ski instructor and a member of the Mount Hood Ski Patrol.\nOn August 8, 1971, Harry B. Carson, 42, and his wife, 34, Joanne and two sons, Harry Jr., 13, and Clifton, 12, fell on Eliot Glacier while climbing Mount Hood. Carson and his family fell about 1,000 feet while descending from the summit. Harry B. Carson and his son Clifton died from their injuries while Joanne and Harry Jr. were critically injured but survived.\nOn July 26, 1976, Cecil Rose, 62, a Sheffield, Alabama man fell to his death near the Summit at about 7:30 am. Two climbers who witnessed his fall told Clackamas County Sheriffs’ officers they estimated he fell quite a long ways, but were unsure of the exact distance. Other witnesses recalled a 300' fall down icy hard snow, and reports claim Rose was not roped up. One climber stayed with Rose while the other went for help. Clackamas County authorities attempted a helicopter rescue, but it failed because of extreme air turbulence. By the time the ground crew reached him, Rose was dead, deputies said.&lt;ref&gt;"

They played their first test against Samoa in 2006, and compete annually in the Oceania Rugby Women's Championship. In 2022, they created history when they scored the third-highest points in both Men's and Women's Rugby at the Oceania Championship when they trounced Papua New Guinea 152–0. They made their first Rugby World Cup appearance at the delayed tournament in New Zealand.\nHistory.\nFiji played their first match in 1997 against a visiting United States XV's team. They played their first international test match against Samoa in the one-off Women's Pacific Tri-Nations in 2006.\nTen years after the Women's Pacific Tri-Nations, the Oceania Rugby Women's Championship was established. The first tournament was held in 2016 between Fiji and Papua New Guinea at the ANZ National Stadium in Suva. The tournament was also part of the 2017 Women's Rugby World Cup qualification process. Fiji beat Papua New Guinea 37–10 to win the inaugural Oceania Championship and progress to the next stage of qualifications.\nFiji met Hong Kong and Japan in a Repechage tournament, but lost both matches and did not qualify for the 2017 World Cup.\nIn 2018, Fijiana won the second edition of the Oceania Championship and successfully defended their title after winning all their matches. \nThe 2019 Oceania Championship also served as a qualifier for the 2021 Rugby World Cup in New Zealand. It was also the first time that the Oceania region was granted a spot at the World Cup. New Zealand and Australia had already qualified from the previous World Cup, Fijiana won the remaining spot and qualified for their first World Cup. \nFiji played two test matches against Australia and Japan in 2022 at Brisbane. It would be their first test match against the Wallaroos and only their second time to meet Japan. Fiji won the 2022 Oceania Rugby Championship in New Zealand.

        "title": "2018 FIFA World Cup",
        "text": "The 2018 FIFA World Cup was the 21st FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Russia from 14 June to 15 July 2018, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in late 2010. It was the eleventh time the championships had been held in Europe, the first time they were held in Eastern Europe, and the first time they were held across two continents (Europe and Asia). At an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion, it was the most expensive World Cup ever held until it was surpassed by the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\nThe tournament phase involved 32 teams, of which 31 came through qualifying competitions, while the host nation Russia qualified automatically. Of the 32, 20 had also appeared in the 2014 event, while Iceland and Panama each made their debut at the World Cup. 64 matches were played in 12 venues across 11 cities. Germany, the defending champions, were eliminated in the group stage for the first time since 1938. Host nation Russia was eliminated in the quarter-finals. In the final, France played Croatia on 15 July at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. France won the match 4–2, claiming their second World Cup and becoming the fourth consecutive title won by a European team, after Italy in 2006, Spain in 2010, and Germany in 2014.\nCroatian player Luka Modrić was voted the tournament's best player, winning the Golden Ball. England's Harry Kane won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals during the tournament with six. Belgium's Thibaut Courtois won the Golden Glove, awarded to the goalkeeper with the best performance. It has been estimated that more than 3 million people attended games during the tournament.\nHost selection.\nThe bidding procedure to host the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup tournaments began in January 2009, and national associations had until 2 February 2009 to register their interest. Initially, nine countries placed bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, but Mexico later withdrew from the proceedings, and Indonesia's bid was rejected by FIFA in February 2010 after the Indonesian government failed to submit a letter to support the bid. During the bidding process, the three remaining non-UEFA nations (Australia, Japan, and the United States) gradually withdrew from the 2018 bids, and thus all UEFA nations were ruled out of the 2022 bid. As such, there were eventually four bids for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, two of which were joint bids: England, Russia, Netherlands/Belgium, and Portugal/Spain.\nThe 22-member FIFA Executive Committee convened in Zürich on 2 December 2010 to vote to select the hosts of both tournaments. Russia won the right to be the 2018 host in the second round of voting. The Portugal/Spain bid came second, and that from Belgium/Netherlands third. England, which was bidding to host its second tournament, was eliminated in the first round.\nThe voting results were:\nHost selection criticism.\nThe choice of Russia as host was controversial. Issues included the high level of racism in Russian football, human rights abuses by Russian authorities, and discrimination against LGBT people in government (including gay propaganda laws) along with wider Russian society. Russia's involvement in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine had also prompted calls for the tournament to be moved, particularly following the annexation of Crimea. In 2014, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that \"the World Cup has been given and voted to Russia and we are going forward with our work\".\nRussia was criticised for alleged abuse of migrant labourers in the construction of World Cup venues, with Human Rights Watch reporting cases where workers were left unpaid, made to work in dangerously cold conditions, or suffering reprisals for raising concerns. A few pundits claimed it was slave labour. In May 2017, FIFA president Gianni Infantino admitted there had been human rights abuses of North Korean workers involved in the construction of Saint Petersburg's Zenit Arena. By June 2017, at least 17 workers had died on World Cup construction sites, according to Building and Wood Workers' International. In August, a group of eight US senators called on FIFA to consider dismissing Russia as the World Cup host if an independent investigation verified allegations of North Koreans being subjected to forced labor.\nRacism and Neo-nazi symbols displayed in the past by some Russian football fans drew criticism, with documented incidents of racial chants, banners spewing hate-filled messages, and sometimes assaults on people from the Caucasus and Central Asia. In March 2015, FIFA's then Vice President Jeffrey Webb said that Russia posed a huge challenge from a racism standpoint, and that a World Cup could not be held there under the current conditions. On July, United Nations anti-discrimination official Yuri Boychenko said that Russian soccer authorities had failed to fully grasp what racism was and needed to do more to combat it. To address this as well as concerns of hooliganism in general, Russian intelligence services blacklisted over 400 fans from entering the stadiums by June 2018, with 32 other countries also sending officers to help local police screen attendees for valid ID cards.\nAllegations of corruption in the bidding processes and concerns over bribery on the part of the Russian team and corruption by FIFA members for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups led to threats from England's FA to boycott the tournament. They claimed that four members of the executive committee had requested bribes to vote for England, and Sepp Blatter had said it had already been arranged before the vote that Russia would win. FIFA appointed Michael J. Garcia, a US attorney, to investigate and produce a report on the corruption allegations. Although the report was never published, FIFA released a 42-page summary of its findings as determined by German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert. Eckert's summary cleared Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing, but was denounced by critics as a whitewash. Because of the controversy, the FA refused to accept Eckert's absolving Russia from blame. Greg Dyke called for a re-examination of the affair and David Bernstein called for a boycott of the World Cup. Garcia criticised the summary as being \"materially incomplete\" with \"erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions\", and appealed to FIFA's Appeal Committee. The committee declined to hear his appeal, so Garcia resigned to protest of FIFA's conduct, citing a \"lack of leadership\" and lack of confidence in Eckert's independence.\nOn 3 June 2015, the FBI confirmed that federal authorities were investigating the bidding and awarding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. In an interview published on 7 June 2015, Domenico Scala, the head of FIFA's Audit And Compliance Committee, stated that \"should there be evidence that the awards to Qatar and Russia came only because of bought votes, then the awards could be cancelled\". Prince William of Wales and former British Prime Minister David Cameron attended a meeting with FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon in which a vote-trading deal for the right to host the 2018 World Cup in England was discussed.\nTeams.\nQualification.\nFor the first time in the history of the FIFA World Cup, all eligible nations—the 209 FIFA member associations except automatically qualified hosts Russia—applied to enter the qualifying process. Zimbabwe and Indonesia were later disqualified before playing their first matches, while Gibraltar and Kosovo, who joined FIFA on 13 May 2016 after the qualifying draw but before European qualifying had begun, also entered the competition. Places in the tournament were allocated to continental confederations, with the allocation unchanged from the 2014 World Cup. The first qualification game, between Timor-Leste and Mongolia, began in Dili on 12 March 2015 as part of the AFC's qualification, and the main qualifying draw took place at the Konstantinovsky Palace in Strelna, Saint Petersburg, on 25 July 2015.\nOf the 32 nations qualified to play at the 2018 FIFA World Cup, 20 countries competed at the previous tournament in 2014. Both Iceland and Panama qualified for the first time, with the former becoming the smallest country in terms of population to reach the World Cup. Other teams returning after absences of at least three tournaments included: Egypt, returning to the finals after their last appearance in 1990; Morocco, who last competed in 1998; Peru, who last appeared in 1982; Senegal, competing for the second time after reaching the quarter-finals in 2002. Poland, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Sweden have also returned after 12 years. It was the first time three Nordic countries (Denmark, Iceland and Sweden) and four Arab nations (Egypt, Morocco, Saudi Arabia and Tunisia) qualified for the World Cup.\nNotable teams that failed to qualify included: four-time champions Italy (for the first time since 1958), who were knocked out in a qualification play-off by quarter-finalists Sweden and were the highest-ranked team to not qualify; and the Netherlands, who were three-time runners-up and had finished in third place in 2014, had qualified for the last three World Cups, and failed to qualify for their second major tournament in a row, missing out on the UEFA Euro 2016 as well. Four reigning continental champions: 2017 Africa Cup of Nations winners Cameroon; two-time Copa América champions and 2017 Confederations Cup runners-up Chile; 2016 OFC Nations Cup winners New Zealand; and 2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup champions the United States (for the first time since 1986) also failed to qualify. The other notable qualifying streaks broken were for Ghana and Ivory Coast, both of which had qualified for the three previous tournaments. The lowest-ranked team to qualify was the host nation, Russia.\nAFC (5)\nCAF (5)\nCONCACAF (3)\nCONMEBOL (5)\nOFC (0)\nUEFA (14)\nDraw.\nThe draw was held on 1 December 2017 at 18:00 MSK at the State Kremlin Palace in Moscow. The 32 teams were drawn into eight groups of four, by selecting one team from each of the four ranked pots.\nFor the draw, the teams were allocated to four pots based entirely on the FIFA World Rankings of October 2017. Pot one contained the hosts Russia (who were automatically assigned to position A1) and the best seven teams. Pot two contained the next best eight teams, and so on for pots three and four. This was different from previous draws, when only pot one was based on FIFA rankings while the remaining pots were based on geographical considerations. However, teams from the same confederation still were not drawn against each other for the group stage, except that two UEFA teams could be in each group. The pots for the draw are shown below.\nSquads.\nInitially, each team had to name a preliminary squad of 30 players, but in February 2018 this was increased to 35. From the preliminary squad, the team had to name a final squad of 23 players (three of whom had to be goalkeepers) by 4 June. Players in the final squad could be replaced for serious injury up to 24 hours prior to kickoff of the team's first match. These replacements did not need to have been named in the preliminary squad.\nFor players named in the 35-player preliminary squad, there was a mandatory rest period between 21 and 27 May 2018, except for those involved in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final played on 26 May.\nOfficiating.\nOn 29 March 2018, FIFA released the list of 36 referees and 63 assistant referees selected to oversee matches. On 30 April 2018, FIFA released the list of 13 video assistant referees, who acted solely in this capacity in the tournament.\nReferee Fahad Al-Mirdasi of Saudi Arabia was removed on 30 May 2018 over a match-fixing attempt, along with his two assistant referees, compatriots Mohammed Al-Abakry and Abdulah Al-Shalwai. A new referee was not appointed, but two assistant referees, Hasan Al Mahri of the United Arab Emirates and Hiroshi Yamauchi of Japan, were added to the list. Assistant referee Marwa Range of Kenya also withdrew after the BBC released an investigation conducted by a Ghanaian journalist which implicated him in a bribery scandal.\nVideo assistant referees.\nShortly after the International Football Association Board's decision to incorporate video assistant referees (VARs) into the Laws of the game (LOTG) on 16 March 2018, the FIFA Council took the much-anticipated step of approving the use of VAR for the first time in a FIFA World Cup tournament.\nVAR operations for all games were operated from a single headquarters in Moscow, which received live video of the games and were in radio contact with the on-field referees. Systems were in place for communicating VAR-related information to broadcasters and visuals on stadiums' large screens were used for the fans in attendance.\nVAR had a significant impact on several games. On 15 June 2018, Diego Costa's first goal against Portugal became the first World Cup goal based on a VAR decision; the first penalty as a result of a VAR decision was awarded to France in their match against Australia on 16 June and resulted in a goal by Antoine Griezmann. A record number of penalties were awarded in the tournament, a phenomenon partially attributed to VAR. Overall, the new technology was both praised and criticised by commentators. FIFA declared the implementation of VAR a success after the first week of competition.\nVenues.\nRussia proposed the following host cities: Kaliningrad, Kazan, Krasnodar, Moscow, Nizhny Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Saint Petersburg, Samara, Saransk, Sochi, Volgograd, Yaroslavl, and Yekaterinburg. Each chosen city was located in European Russia (except Yekaterinburg, which is located in Asia but lies very close to the Europe-Asia border) in order to reduce travel time for the teams in the huge country. The bid evaluation report stated: \"The Russian bid proposes 13 host cities and 16 stadiums, thus exceeding FIFA's minimum requirement. Three of the 16 stadiums would be renovated, and 13 would be newly constructed.\"\nIn October 2011, Russia reduced the number of stadiums from 16 to 14. Construction of the proposed Podolsk stadium in the Moscow Oblast was cancelled by the regional government. Also, in the capital, Otkritie Arena was competing with Dynamo Stadium over which would be constructed first.\nThe final choice of host cities was announced on 29 September 2012. The number of cities was reduced further to 11 and the number of stadiums to 12 as Krasnodar and Yaroslavl were dropped from the final list. Of the 12 stadiums used for the tournament, three (Luzhniki, Yekaterinburg and Sochi) had been extensively renovated and the other nine were brand new; $11.8 billion was spent on hosting the tournament.\nSepp Blatter had said in July 2014 that, given the concerns over the completion of venues in Russia, the number of venues for the tournament may be reduced from 12 to 10. He also said, \"We are not going to be in a situation, as is the case of one, two or even three stadiums in South Africa, where it is a problem of what you do with these stadiums\".\nIn October 2014, on their first official visit to Russia, FIFA's inspection committee and its head, Chris Unger, visited St. Petersburg, Sochi, Kazan and both Moscow venues. They were satisfied with the progress. On 8 October 2015, FIFA and the local organising committee agreed on the official names of the stadiums to be used during the tournament. Of the twelve venues, the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow and the Saint Petersburg Stadium—the two largest stadiums in Russia—were used most; both hosted seven matches. Sochi, Kazan, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara each hosted six matches, including one quarter-final match each, while the Otkritie Stadium in Moscow and the Rostov Stadium hosted five matches, including one round-of-16 match each. Volgograd, Kaliningrad, Yekaterinburg and Saransk each hosted four matches, but did not host any knockout stage games.\nStadiums.\nTwelve stadiums in eleven Russian cities were built or renovated for the FIFA World Cup. Between 2010 (when Russia were announced as hosts) and 2018, nine of the twelve stadiums were built (some in place of older, outdated venues) and the other three were renovated for the tournament.\nTeam base camps.\nBase camps were used by the 32 national squads to stay and train before and during the World Cup tournament. On 9 February 2018, FIFA announced the base camps for each participating team.\nPreparation and costs.\nBudget.\nAt an estimated cost of over $14.2 billion , the 2018 FIFA event was the most expensive World Cup in history, surpassing the $11.6 billion cost of the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil.\nThe Russian government had originally earmarked a budget of around $20 billion, which was later slashed to $10 billion, for World Cup preparations. Half was spent on transportation infrastructure. As part of the program to prepare for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, a federal sub-program—\"Construction and Renovation of Transport Infrastructure\"—was implemented with a total budget of ₽352.5 billion (rubles), with ₽170.3 billion coming from the federal budget, ₽35.1 billion from regional budgets, and ₽147.1 billion from investors. The biggest item of federal spending was the aviation infrastructure costing ₽117.8 billion. Construction of new hotels was a crucial area of infrastructure development in World Cup host cities. Costs continued to mount as preparations were underway.\nInfrastructure spending.\nPlatov International Airport in Rostov-on-Don was upgraded with automated air traffic control systems. Modern surveillance, navigation, communication, control, and meteorological support systems were also installed. Koltsovo Airport in Yekaterinburg was upgraded with radio-engineering tools for flight operation and received a second runway. Saransk Airport received a new navigation system; two new hotels were constructed in the city—the Mercure Saransk Centre (Accor Hotels) and Four Points by Sheraton Saransk as well as few other smaller accommodation facilities. In Samara, new tram lines were laid. Khrabrovo Airport in Kaliningrad was upgraded with radio navigation and weather equipment. Renovation and upgraded radio-engineering tools for flight operations was completed in the Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Volgograd, Samara, Yekaterinburg, Kazan and Sochi airports. On 27 March, the Russian Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector of reported that all communications within its area of responsibility had been commissioned. The last facility commissioned was a waste treatment station in Volgograd. In Yekaterinburg, where four matches were hosted, hosting costs increased to over ₽7.4 billion, exceeding the ₽5.6 billion rubles originally allocated from the state and regional budget.\nVolunteers.\nVolunteer applications to the 2018 Russia Local Organising Committee opened on 1 June 2016. The 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Volunteer Program received about 177,000 applications, and engaged a total of 35,000 volunteers. They received training at 15 Volunteer Centres of the local organising committee based in 15 universities, and in volunteer centres in the host cities. Preference, especially in key areas, was given to those with knowledge of a foreign language and volunteering experience, but not necessarily to Russian nationals.\nTransport.\nFree public transport services were offered for ticketholders during the World Cup, including additional trains linking host cities, as well as services such as bus services within them.\nSchedule.\nThe full schedule was announced by FIFA on 24 July 2015 without kick-off times, which were confirmed later. On 1 December 2017, following the final draw, FIFA adjusted six kick-off times.\nRussia was placed in position A1 in the group stage and played in the opening match at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow on 14 June against Saudi Arabia, the two lowest-ranked teams of the tournament at the time of the final draw. The Luzhniki Stadium also hosted the second semi-final on 11 July and the final on 15 July. The Krestovsky Stadium in Saint Petersburg hosted the first semi-final on 10 July and the third place play-off on 14 July.\nOpening ceremony.\nThe opening ceremony took place on Thursday, 14 June 2018, at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow, preceding the opening match of the tournament between hosts Russia and Saudi Arabia.\nAt the start of the ceremony, Russian president Vladimir Putin gave a speech, welcoming the countries of the world to Russia and calling football a uniting force. Brazilian World Cup-winning striker Ronaldo entered the stadium with a child in a Russia jersey. Pop singer Robbie Williams then sang two of his songs solo before he and Russian soprano Aida Garifullina performed a duet. Dancers dressed in the flags of the 32 competing teams appeared carrying a sign with the name of each nation. At the end of the ceremony Ronaldo reappeared with the official match ball which had returned from the International Space Station in early June.\nYoung participants of the international children's social programme Football for Friendship from 211 countries and regions took part in the opening ceremony of the FIFA World Cup at the Luzhniki stadium.\nGroup stage.\nCompeting countries were divided into eight groups of four teams (groups A to H). Teams in each group played one another in a round-robin, with the top two teams advancing to the knockout stage. Ten European teams and four South American teams progressed to the knockout stage, together with Japan and Mexico.\nFor the first time since 1938, Germany, the reigning champions, were eliminated in the first round. This was the third consecutive tournament in which the holders were eliminated in the first round, after Italy in 2010 and Spain in 2014. No African team progressed to the second round for the first time since 1982. The fair play criteria came into use for the first time when Japan qualified over Senegal because the team had received fewer yellow cards. Only one match, France versus Denmark, was goalless. Until then there were a record 36 straight games in which at least one goal was scored. All times listed below are local time.\nKnockout stage.\nIn the knockout stages, if a match was level at the end of normal playing time, extra time was played (two periods of 15 minutes each) and followed, if necessary, by a penalty shoot-out to determine the winners. If a match went into extra time, each team was allowed to make a fourth substitution, the first time this had been allowed in a FIFA World Cup tournament. Below is the bracket for the knockout round of the tournament, teams in bold denote match winners.\nStatistics.\nDiscipline.\nIn total, only four players were sent off in the entire tournament, the fewest since 1978. International Football Association Board technical director David Elleray stated a belief that this was due to the introduction of VAR, since players would know that they would not be able to get away with anything under the new system.\nA player is automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:\nThe following suspensions were served during the tournament:\nAwards.\nThe following awards were given at the conclusion of the tournament.

Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said the logo was inspired by \"Russia's rich artistic tradition and its history of bold achievement and innovation\", and FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that it reflected the \"heart and soul\" of the country. For branding, Portuguese design agency Brandia Central created materials in 2014, with a typeface called \"Dusha\" – – designed by Brandia Central and edited by Adotbelow of the DSType Foundry in Portugal.\nTicketing.\nThe first phase of ticket sales started on 14 September 2017, 12:00 Moscow Time, and lasted until 12 October 2017.\nThe general visa policy of Russia did not apply to participants and spectators, who were able to visit Russia without a visa right before and during the competition regardless of their citizenship. Spectators were nonetheless required to register for a \"Fan-ID\", a special photo identification pass. A Fan-ID was required to enter the country visa-free, while a ticket, Fan-ID and a valid passport were required to enter stadiums for matches. Fan-IDs also granted World Cup attendees free access to public transport services, including buses, and train service between host cities. Fan-ID was administered by the Ministry of Digital Development, Communications and Mass Media, which could revoke this accreditation at any time to \"ensure the defence capability or security of the state or public order\".\nMerchandise.\nOn 29 May 2018, Electronic Arts released a free update to their video game \"FIFA 18\" that added content related to the 2018 FIFA World Cup. The expansion included a World Cup tournament mode with all teams and stadiums from the event, official television presentation elements, and World Cup-related content for the Ultimate Team mode.\nPanini continued their partnership with FIFA by producing stickers for their World Cup sticker album. Panini also developed an app for the 2018 World Cup where fans could collect and swap virtual stickers, with 5 million fans gathering digital stickers for the tournament.\nSymbols.\nMascot.\nThe tournament's official mascot was unveiled on 21 October 2016, and selected through a design competition among university students. A public vote was used to select the mascot from three finalists—a cat, a tiger, and a wolf. The winner, with 53% or approximately 1 million votes, was Zabivaka—an anthropomorphic wolf dressed in the colours of the Russian national team. Zabivaka's name is a portmanteau of the Russian words забияка (\"hothead\") and забивать (\"to score\"), and his official backstory states that he is an aspiring football player who is \"charming, confident and social\".\nMatch ball.\nThe official match ball, the \"Telstar 18\", was unveiled on 9 November 2017. It was based on the name and design of the first Adidas World Cup ball from 1970. A special red-coloured variation, \"Telstar Mechta\", was used for the knockout stage of the tournament. The word \"mechta\" (Russian: мечта) means \"dream\" or \"ambition\".\nGoalkeepers noted that the ball was slippery and prone to having unpredictable trajectory. In addition, two Telstar 18 balls popped in the midst of a first-round match between France and Australia, leading to further discussions over the ball's performance.\nMusic.\nThe official song of the tournament was \"Live It Up\", with vocals by Will Smith, Nicky Jam and Era Istrefi, released on 25 May 2018. Its music video was released on 8 June 2018.\nOther controversies.\nThirty-three footballers who were alleged to be part of the Russian steroid programme are listed in the McLaren Report. On 22 December 2017, it was reported that FIFA had fired a doctor who had been investigating doping in Russian football. On 22 May 2018, FIFA stated that the investigations concerning all Russian players named for the provisional squad of the FIFA World Cup in Russia had been completed, with the result that insufficient evidence was found to support anti-doping rule violations. FIFA's medical committee also decided that Russian personnel would not be involved in performing drug testing procedures at the tournament, an action taken to reassure teams that samples would not be tampered with.\nRussia relaxed its visa rules during the World Cup, allowing Fan ID holders to enter and exit Russia without a visa through 31 December 2018. Traffickers exploited this system to bring foreign sex trafficking victims into the country, especially from Nigeria. Reuters had raised concerns about the victims' conditions, who had allegedly been forced into prostitution, with some of them enduring violent abuse. Russian authorities were accused of doing little to fix to the issue, allegedly because many locals blamed the victims for falling into prostitution.\nResponse to Skripal poisoning.\nIn response to the March 2018 poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal, British prime minister Theresa May announced that no British ministers or members of the royal family would attend the World Cup, and issued a warning to any travelling England fans. Russia responded to the comments from the UK Parliament claiming that the West are trying to \"take the World Cup out of Russia\". The Russian Foreign Ministry denounced Boris Johnson's statements that compared the event to the 1936 Olympics held in Nazi Germany as \"poisoned with venom of hate, unprofessionalism and boorishness\" and \"unacceptable and unworthy\" parallel towards Russia, a \"nation that lost millions of lives in fighting Nazism\".\nCritical reception.\nAt the close of the World Cup, Russia was widely praised for its success in hosting the tournament, with Steve Rosenberg of the BBC deeming it \"a resounding public relations success\" for Putin, adding: \"The stunning new stadiums, free train travel to venues and the absence of crowd violence has impressed visiting supporters. Russia has come across as friendly and hospitable: a stark contrast with the country's authoritarian image. All the foreign fans I have spoken to are pleasantly surprised.\"\nDespite the British Foreign Office and MPs repeatedly warning English football fans travelling to Russia of \"racist or homophobic intimidation, hooligan violence and anti-British hostility\", fans who did travel said they received a warm welcome from ordinary citizens after arriving in Russia.\nFIFA president Gianni Infantino stated: \"Everyone discovered a beautiful country, a welcoming country, that is keen to show the world that everything that has been said before might not be true. A lot of preconceived ideas have been changed because people have seen the true nature of Russia.\" Infantino has proclaimed Russia 2018 to be \"the best World Cup ever.\" 98 percent of the stadiums were sold out, there were 3 billion viewers on TV around the world and 7 million fans visited the fan fests. It was the most viewed World Cup to date, and the third most viewed television broadcast, surpassing the Beijing Olympics in 2008.\nBroadcasting rights.\nFIFA, through several companies, sold the broadcasting rights for the 2018 FIFA World Cup to various local broadcasters. After having tested the technology at limited matches of the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup, and the 2014 FIFA World Cup (via private tests and public viewings in the host city of Rio de Janeiro), the 2018 World Cup was the first World Cup in which all matches were produced in 4K ultra high definition. Host Broadcast Services (HBS) stated that at least 75% of the broadcast cut of each match would come from 4K cameras (covering the majority of main angles), with instant replays and some camera angles being converted up from 1080p high definition sources with limited degradation in quality. These broadcasts were made available from selected rightsholders and television providers.\nIn February 2018, Ukrainian rightsholder stated that it would not broadcast the World Cup due to existing tensions with Russia amidst the Russo-Ukrainian War. This came in the wake of growing boycott of the tournament by the Football Federation of Ukraine and sports minister Ihor Zhdanov. Additionally, the FFU refused to accredit journalists for the World Cup and waived their quota of tickets. However, the Ukrainian state TV still broadcast the World Cup, and more than 4 million Ukrainians watched the opening match.\nBroadcast rights to the tournament in the Middle East were hampered by an ongoing diplomatic crisis in Qatar, which saw Bahrain, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates cut diplomatic ties with Qatar—the home country of FIFA's Middle East and Africa rightsholder beIN Sports—in June 2017, over its alleged state support of terrorist groups. On 2 June 2018, beIN pulled its channels from Du and Etisalat, but with service to the latter restored later that day. Etisalat subsequently announced that it would air the World Cup in the UAE, and continue to offer beIN normally and without interruptions. In Saudi Arabia, beIN was banned from doing business; as a result, its channels and other content have been widely and illegally repackaged by a broadcaster identifying itself as \"beoutQ\". While FIFA attempted to negotiate the sale of a package consisting of Saudi matches and the final indirectly, they were unable to do so. On 12 July 2018, FIFA stated that it had \"engaged counsel to take legal action in Saudi Arabia and is working alongside other sports rights owners that have also been affected to protect its interests.\"\nIn the United States, the 2018 World Cup was the first men's World Cup whose English rights were held by Fox Sports, and Spanish rights held by Telemundo. The elimination of the United States in the qualifiers led to concerns that U.S. interest and viewership of this World Cup would be reduced, noting that \"casual\" viewers of U.S. matches caused them to peak at 16.5 million in 2014, and determined how much Fox paid for the rights. During a launch event prior to the elimination, Fox stated that it had planned to place a secondary focus on the Mexican team in its coverage to take advantage of their popularity among Hispanic and Latino Americans. Fox stated that it was still committed to broadcasting a significant amount of tournament coverage. Viewership was down overall compared to 2014; match scheduling and time zones were not as favourable to viewers in the Americas as they were in 2014. Many games aired in the morning hours, although Telemundo's broadcast of the Mexico-Sweden Group F match was announced as being its most-watched weekday daytime program in the network's history.\nUnlike previous tournaments, where the rights were bundled with those of South Korea, Korean Central Television acquired rights to the 2018 World Cup within North Korea. Broadcasts only began with the round of 16, and matches were tape delayed and edited for time. In addition, matches involving Japan were excluded from the broadcasts, due to strained relations and campaigns against the country.\nAudience.\nA combined 3.572 billion unique viewers (live global 1-minute reach) – more than half of the global population aged four and over – tuned in to world football's ultimate competition, according to audience data for official broadcast coverage of the 2018 FIFA World Cup.\nThe average global live audience for every game of the tournament was 191 million viewers (for a cumulative live audience of 12.224  billion viewers), a 2.1% increase over the 2014 tournament average of 187 million viewers, including that average audience in the early stages (group stage and round of 16) were bigger than in 2014. However, in 2018, the audience was 15 percent smaller for the semi-finals, 17 percent for the third place play-off, and 5.1 percent for the final, which was watched by 517 million people on average (only in-home TV viewers), compared to 545 million in 2014. Presumably, the reason for that is the smaller countries involved in the top four games compared to those in 2014, and only one global region (Europe) being represented in 2018 (compared to South America and Europe in 2014). However the live global 1-minute reach of the final was 1.12 billion people (884.37 in-home TV viewers and 231.82 million out-of-home and (or) digital-only viewers)."

        "title": "Joe Gallagher (baseball)",
        "text": "Joseph Emmett Gallagher (March 7, 1914 – February 25, 1998), nicknamed \"Muscles\", was an American professional baseball left fielder. He played two seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Yankees, St. Louis Browns, and Brooklyn Dodgers between 1939 and 1940.\nIn 165 games, Gallagher posted a .273 batting average (133-for-487) with 73 runs, 16 home runs and 73 RBIs. He recorded a .950 fielding percentage playing at left and right field.\nBorn in Buffalo, New York, he attended and played ball for the same high school as Warren Spahn, South Park High School in South Buffalo. He was one of the \"Four Joes\" of the 1939 New York Yankees, along with Baseball Hall of Famers Joe DiMaggio, Joe McCarthy, and Joe Gordon. His major league career ended after missing the entire 1941–1945 seasons due to military service, though he spent a brief time with the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946. He later coached collegiately, for both the Stephen F. Austin and Rice baseball teams. He died at age 83 in Houston, Texas.\nPro career.\nIn 1936, Gallagher was signed by the New York Yankees and assigned to their affiliate in the Piedmont League, the Norfolk Tars. Gallagher performed well for the team, which was managed by former major leaguer first baseman Johnny Neun. That season, Gallagher played in 142 games, and finished the season with 19 home runs and a .348 batting average. Gallagher began to climb his way up the ladder in the Yankees farm system, eventually playing for their Double-A ball club, the Kansas City Blues. At Kansas City, Gallagher continued to show his power at the plate, leading the team with 24 home runs. He hit two more than teammate Wally Judnich.\nIn 1939, Gallagher made his debut in the major leagues, which made him briefly a teammate of Lou Gehrig. Gallagher was back-up to outfielder George Selkirk and made his MLB debut April 20th, going 0-3 in the Yankees 2-0 win over the Boston Red Sox. On June 13 of his rookie season, the Yankees traded Gallagher to the St. Louis Browns for reserve infielder Roy Hughes. While with St. Louis, Gallagher batted .282 and hit nine home runs while appearing in 71 games. The Browns finished the season in last place.\nOn May 27, the Browns traded Gallagher to the Brooklyn Dodgers in exchange for Roy Cullenbine, and infielder/outfield. In 1946, at the age 32, Gallagher appeared in six games for the Montreal Royals, where he was teammates with Jackie Robinson. After his brief return, Gallagher retired from baseball.\nCollege baseball.\nGallagher's playing career was interrupted by service in the United States Army in 1941 but, by the time his service had ended, he had gained too much weight to continue playing at the Major League level. After returning to North America and playing minor league baseball briefly, Gallagher graduated from Stephen F. Austin State University in 1947, graduated from the University of Houston in 1950 and attended the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in 1951.\nIn March 1947, he was hired as the head coach of the Stephen F. Austin Lumberjacks baseball team. He held that job through the 1949 season, after which he resigned to attend the University of Houston and was replaced by Paul Geisler. He was named the head coach of the Rice Owls baseball team prior to the 1962 season."

The site is often used by major media organizations and baseball broadcasters as a source for statistics. It offers a variety of advanced baseball sabermetrics in addition to traditional baseball \"counting stats\".\nBaseball-Reference is part of Sports Reference, LLC; according to an article in Street &amp; Smith's \"Sports Business Journal\", the company's sites have more than one million unique users per month.\nHistory.\nFounder Sean Forman began developing the website while working on his Ph.D. dissertation in applied math and computational science at the University of Iowa. While writing his dissertation, he had also been writing articles on and blogging about sabermetrics. Forman's database was originally built from the \"Total Baseball\" series of baseball encyclopedias.\nThe website went online in April 2000, after first being launched in February 2000 as part of the website for the \"Big Bad Baseball Annual\". It was originally built as a web interface to the Lahman Baseball Database, though it now employs a variety of data sources.\nIn 2004, Forman founded Sports Reference. Sports Reference is a website that came out of the Baseball Reference website. The company was incorporated as Sports Reference, LLC in 2007. In 2006, Forman left his job as a math professor at Saint Joseph's University in order to focus on Baseball-Reference full-time.\nIn February 2009, Fantasy Sports Ventures took a minority stake in Sports Reference, LLC, the parent company of Baseball-Reference, for a \"low seven-figure sum\".\nAt the end of April 2021, the site changed a number of identifying names, \"discontinuing the use of nicknames that are racially or ethnically influenced\" and \"names based upon a player's disability\", such as Chief Bender and Dummy Hoy, who are now listed as Charles Bender and Billy Hoy, respectively.\nFeatures.\nThe site has season, career, and minor league records (when available, back to ) for everyone who has played Major League Baseball, year-by-year team pages, all final league standings, all postseason numbers, voting results for all historic awards such as the Cy Young Award and MVP, head-to-head batter vs. pitcher career totals, individual statistical leaders for each season and all-time, managers' career records, the full results of all MLB player drafts, Negro leagues statistics (Baseball Reference added Negro League Statistics to its website in 2021), a baseball encyclopedia (the Bullpen), and box scores and game logs from every MLB game back to , among other features.\nTo compare ballplayers to one-another it offers \"Black ink\" and \"Gray Ink\" tests, which tally a player's dominance and overall productivity against his peers. It also offers sabermetrician Jay Jaffe's system acronymned \"JAWS\" for ranking players of different eras against each other by weighting their primes.\nIn addition, there are a number of what the website calls \"Frivolities\", e.g., The Oracle of Baseball, which links any two players by common teammates in the way the pop culture favorite \"Oracle of Bacon\" website does. Another one of their Frivolities is the page devoted to Keith Hernandez's mustache, which is the only \"fictional\" page on Baseball-Reference. Another \"Frivolity\" was added in 2023, when the site made \"Tungsten Arm O'Doyle\", an internet meme associated with Shohei Ohtani, a redirect to Ohtani's page.\nBullpen.\nBaseball-Reference has its own baseball encyclopedia, a wiki called \"Baseball Reference Bullpen\", which can be edited by anyone and is modeled after Wikipedia. the Baseball Reference Bullpen contains over 109,100 articles."

        "title": "One-wall handball",
        "text": "One-wall handball, also known as 1-wall, wallball or international fronton, is an indirect style of a ball game where the player hits a small rubber ball with their hand against a wall. The goal of the game is to score more points than the opponent. The player then hits the ball, and the ball bounces off the wall and the floor within court lines, if the opponent fails to return the ball, the player scores a point. The sport was created to bring together varieties, such as American handball, Basque pelota, Patball, Gaelic handball, Pêl-Law (Welsh handball) and Valencian frontó.\nCourtfield.\nInternational fronton uses the most basic courtfield layout of the indirect style: one wall where the ball must bounce.\nThis only wall, the fronton, is wide and high. From the left and right corners two lines are drawn on the ground, long, that mark the place into which the ball may bounce, this is the courtfield.\nThere must be some free space out the courtfield for the players to play balls that are risking to bounce twice.\nAt from the fronton wall there is a line on the ground, the fault line. The serving player must throw the ball before that line, and the ball must surpass it after bouncing on the fronton.\nAt from the fronton there is another line on the ground, the back line, which the ball may not bounce from.\nIn agreement with American handball (and unlike Basque pelota and Valencian frontó) there is no left or back wall, the ball may bounce on the lines, and, specially, there is no line on the fronton for the ball to ball over.\nBall.\nThe One Wall ball / International fronton ball ('big ball') is a synthetic one, without any default colour. According to the GAA Handball 1-Wall playing rules [As of January 2019] (which is in line with United States Handball Association playing rules), the ball used shall be in line with the following: \nThis ball is also used in the 'Big Ball' grades at the World Handball Championships organised by the World Handball Council. The One wall ball is widely available - manufacturers of the One Wall ball include O'Neills, Decathlon 'Urball' brand, MacSports 'Challenger' brand &amp; Sky Bounce. The 'small ball' (mainly used in 4-Wall American handball/Gaelic handball competitions) is also used in the 'small ball' one-wall/wallball grades at the World Championships.\nRules.\nTwo players (1 against 1) or four players (2 against 2) play to score points until one of them attain two sets (composed by 21 points).\nPlayers strike the ball with the hand so that it bounces on the fronton and falls into the courtfield. Whoever fails to do so commits a fault and so loses a point, then the opponent serves.\nA fault is committed if:\nCompetitions.\nThere are several major international competitions held in the sport, in addition to clubs/communities/regional associations across the globe hosting their own local/regional tournaments. \nThe European 1-Wall Tour is a Wallball circuit around Europe.

He served as the head football coach at Hardin–Simmons University (1935–1940), Baylor University (1941–1942, 1945–1946), and West Texas State University—now West Texas A&amp;M University (1947–1957). Kimbrough was also the head basketball coach at Hardin–Simmons from 1936 to 1941, tallying a mark of 29–50. He was the brother of Texas A&amp;M star football player John Kimbrough.\nKimbrough began his college coaching career at Hardin–Simmons in 1935. After finishing the 1940 season with a perfect 9–0 record, Kimbrough—at age 37—was hired by Baylor, replacing Morley Jennings. With mediocre results in his first three seasons, Kimbrough resigned after Baylor went 1–8 in 1946. In the middle of his Baylor tenure, Kimbrough served as the head coach for the North Carolina Pre-Flight School team in 1943 and led the Cloudbusters to an overall record of 2–4–1. He was immediately hired by West Texas A&amp;M, where he coached the following 11 years. In 1950 his team went 10–1, including a Sun Bowl win over Cincinnati. Kimbrough retired in 1957 to become the school's athletic director. Kimbrough Memorial Stadium in Canyon, Texas, West Texas A&amp;M's football field, is named in his honor."

        "text": "Cynthia Louise \"Cindy\" Brown (born March 16, 1965) is a retired American women's basketball player, at the college, Olympic and professional levels. Brown was a member of the USA Basketball team which went on to win a gold medal at the Pan American Games in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1987, and the gold medal at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. She was also a member of the gold medal-winning team for the US at the 1985 World University Games, and the 1986 World Championship team.\nCollege career.\nBorn in Portland, Oregon, Brown played basketball for Long Beach State University between 1983 and 1987. As a senior, she set two NCAA scoring records—the most points in a single season (974) and the most points in a single game (60). The 60 point game was against San Jose State, a game Long Beach would win 149–69. Brown was a member of the Final Four All-Tournament team in 1987, and earned first team All-America honors in 1986 and 1987.\nLong Beach State University statistics.\nSource\nProfessional career.\nBecause the U.S. lacked a women's pro league, Brown played professionally in Europe and Japan for almost a decade. She played for:\nShe was selected by the Seattle Reign in the second round of the ABL Draft on June 19, 1996. A 6'-1\" center/power forward, a tenacious rebounder and a strong inside scoring presence, Brown earned Second Team All-ABL honors following the 1996–97 season. She was assigned to the site of her college success, the expansion Long Beach Stingrays on April 26, 1997. Before she ever reported to Long Beach, however, Brown signed with the rival WNBA.\nWNBA.\nBrown was part of the initial player allocation prior to the 1998 season and was sent to the Detroit Shock. Brown's debut game was played on June 13, 1998 in a 69 - 78 loss to the Charlotte Sting where she recorded 10 points and 8 rebounds.\nIn her first season with the Shock, she was the starting Forward for all 30 games of the season, finished second in the WNBA in rebounding and was named to the 1998 All-WNBA Second Team. On August 10, 1998, Brown broke the Shock franchise record for most rebounds in a game when she grabbed 21 rebounds in a 77 - 73 win over the Utah Starzz. Future Detroit Shock star Cheryl Ford would tie Brown's rebound record on June 22, 2003 against the Connecticut Sun, but then Ford broke the record on May 22, 2004 when she snagged 22 boards against the San Antonio Silver Stars. The Shock finished the 1998 season with a 17-13 record but missed the playoffs.\nOn July 29, 1999, midway through her second WNBA season, Brown was traded, along with teammate Korie Hlede, to the Utah Starzz for Wendy Palmer and Olympia Scott-Richardson. It was alleged that both Hlede and Brown requested to be traded from Detroit. Hlede wanted more playing time as her minutes per game dropped from 33.8 in her rookie season with the Shock, to 19.4 in her sophomore season. While Brown was alleged to have not gotten along well with coach and general manager Nancy Lieberman.\nBrown played in 9 of Utah's remaining 11 season games (missing the final 2 games of the season). She started in all 9 of those games and averaged 3.8 points and 3.7 rebounds. The Starzz closed out the season winning 8 of their last 11 games. Unfortunately, the team had a 7 - 14 record by the time Brown arrived and the team consequently missed the playoffs after finishing 15 - 17.\nAfter finishing the 1999 season with the Starzz, Brown would announce her retirement from the WNBA. Her final game in the league was played on August 16, 1999 in a 71 - 80 loss to the Houston Comets. In her final game, Brown recorded 2 rebounds, 1 assist but no points."

        "text": "The Seattle Reign was the first women's professional basketball franchise in Seattle, Washington, USA. The Reign was a charter member of the American Basketball League (ABL). The team played from 1996 through 1998. The team's name was a reference to the city's reputation for rain and its location in King County, with an additional allusion to \"The Reign Man\" Shawn Kemp, then the city's biggest basketball star.\nThe Reign played most of its home games in the Mercer Arena, part of Seattle Center, but occasionally the team played at the larger KeyArena, home of the NBA's Seattle SuperSonics. The Arena was an old-fashioned, intimate setting for a basketball game, but its seating capacity of about 5,000 limited the team's upside attendance potential.\nIn the team's inaugural season, the Reign drafted 1996 Olympic team veteran Venus Lacy to play center, but Lacy was generally outshone by the team's other two \"big women\", Cindy Brown and Tari Phillips. (This was the case even before February 4, 1997, when Lacy was lost for the season due to a severe car injury.) The starting point guard for most games was Christy Hedgpeth, and Kate Paye was the shooting guard. Another player of note was Angela Aycock.\nIn the team's second season, with some fanfare, the team drafted Stanford small forward Kate Starbird, who had been a local prep star at Tacoma's Lakes High School. An even bigger impact player proved to be the University of Alabama's Shalonda Enis, who was named the ABL's Rookie of the Year for the 1997–98 season.\nFrom 1997 on, the ABL faced serious competition from the deeper-pocketed WNBA. Fifteen games into the Reign's third season, on December 22, 1998 the ABL suddenly reached a financial crisis and folded its operations. The Reign was in the midst of its only winning season, having only weeks prior achieved their most memorable victory, a double-overtime win before an enthusiastic crowd of 7,400 at the KeyArena, over the San Jose Lasers, led by Jennifer Azzi.\nUnlike most localities that had an ABL team, Seattle was quickly awarded a WNBA franchise two years later. The Seattle Storm debuted in 2000, and won their first WNBA Championship four years later in 2004, and have gone on to win three more WNBA titles.\nAll-Star Players.\nCindy Brown (All-ABL 2nd Team 1997)&lt;br&gt;\nShalonda Enis (All-ABL 2nd Team 1998)&lt;br&gt;\nTari Phillips (ABL All-Star game MVP, 1997–1998)\nLeague Honors.\nRookie of the Year\nShalonda Enis (1998)"

        "text": "Kevin Murray (born June 18, 1964) is a former American football quarterback at Texas A&amp;M University and is currently a high school football coach. Murray's younger brother is former Major League Baseball (MLB) outfielder Calvin Murray. His son, Kyler, won the Heisman Trophy and was selected first overall in the 2019 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals.\nHigh school.\nHe was an All-State quarterback at North Dallas High School and was named Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex Offensive Player of the Year his senior season. He was also a center fielder for the North Dallas baseball team. Murray was drafted by the Milwaukee Brewers in the 11th Round (287th overall) of 1982 MLB Draft and played one season ('82) for their Pikeville rookie league team in the Appalachian League before enrolling at Texas A&amp;M.\nCollege.\nMurray arrived at Texas A&amp;M in the fall of 1983. Against Arkansas, he threw three touchdown passes in a six-minute span and finished the game off with a late fourth-quarter touchdown toss to set a freshman school record with four touchdowns in a game. By the end of the season, he had been named the Southwest Conference Newcomer of the Year as well as second-team all-conference. He finished the year as the SWC's total offense leader, averaging 165 yds per game and was the conference leader with 14 touchdown passes. On the season, he passed for 1,544 yds and 14 touchdowns with a 53% completion rate. In 1984, in the third game of his sophomore year, Murray shattered his ankle diving for a first down in a game against Arkansas State. The injury would require surgery and a year of rehabilitation.\nIn 1985, Texas A&amp;M appealed to the NCAA and received a medical hardship exemption, making 1984 a redshirt year for Murray and granting him an additional year of eligibility. Murray had an outstanding 1985 season, passing for 2,463 yards then an A&amp;M record. A&amp;M beat SMU, Arkansas, and Texas in three late-season home games that were all televised by ESPN. The Aggies' 42-10 whipping of Texas to return to the Cotton Bowl Classic for the first time since 1968 made Murray a household name.\nFor his efforts, he earned second team All-American honors from the Football News and Offensive MVP honors in the Aggies' 1986 Cotton Bowl Classic victory over Auburn and Heisman Trophy winner Bo Jackson. In the game, Murray passed for 292 yards, breaking Joe Montana's Cotton Bowl Classic record and leading the Aggies to a 36–16 win. After the season, Murray was named Offensive Player of the Year by the Associated Press, The Dallas Morning News and Houston Chronicle.\nMurray had a spectacular 1986 season, one in which he broke most of Texas A&amp;M's passing records and became the Southwest Conference's all-time touchdown leader. He was once again named a 2nd team All-American and led the Aggies to their second consecutive top-10 finish. One of Murray's career highlights came during the 1986 Baylor game at Kyle Field, in which he rallied the Aggies from a 17–0 deficit to a 31–30 victory, completing 25-of-40 passes for 308 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for another. The game was voted the decade's best by Texas Football magazine\nThe Aggies returned to the Cotton Bowl Classic that year to face Ohio State, but Murray's return appearance was not as successful. In what would be his final game at A&amp;M, Murray threw five interceptions while completing only 12 of 31 passes as the Aggies ended a great season with a frustrating defeat. He finished his Aggie career 25-6-1 as a starter, making him the winningest quarterback in Aggie history (his career wins record was later broken by Corey Pullig).\nPost-career awards.\nIn 1999, Murray was named to the Texas A&amp;M Athletic Hall of Fame.\nIn 2012, Murray was inducted into the AT&amp;T Cotton Bowl Classic Hall of Fame. Fellow 2012 AT&amp;T Cotton Bowl Classic Hall of Fame inductees included Texas linebacker/defensive back Tom Campbell, Notre Dame head coach Lou Holtz, BYU middle linebacker Shay Muirbrook, and Arkansas defensive lineman Jim Williams.\nProfessional.\nMurray made himself eligible for the NFL draft after his junior year, but went undrafted. Although one of the nation's top orthopedic specialists cleared Murray to play in the NFL, concerns about his health and lingering issues with his ankle kept teams away. Murray had two brief professional stints, signing as a free-agent with the San Francisco 49ers and the Calgary Stampeders, but eventually retired due to the chronic ankle injury that had plagued him since his early days at Texas A&amp;M.\nCoaching.\nMurray was serving as the high school quarterback coach at Parish Episcopal School and runs the Air 14 Quarterback Academy as of 2013.\nPersonal life.\nMurray is married to Missy Murray. His son Kyler played quarterback in his father's footsteps at Texas A&amp;M before transferring to the University of Oklahoma, where he won the Heisman Trophy in 2018. Kyler went on to become the first-overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft by the Arizona Cardinals."

The side played their first fifteen-a-side test match against Jamaica in 2004.\nHistory.\nIn the late 1990s women’s touch rugby was flourishing in the Cayman Islands under the guidance of Chris “Jacko” Jackson. A small core of all round sports women (Tracy Iler, Mitch Taylor, Lisa Kehoe) and contact rugby veterans (Karen Jessop and Jessica Lane) were keen to take the next step into forming a women’s contact rugby team. With the employment of Richard Adams as the CRFU’s first Director of Rugby in 2000 momentum began to grow until ex-rugby league professional, Steve “Smudger” Smith, was enlisted as the first women’s contact rugby coach. The initial training sessions saw about 14 women attending but as the reality of black eyes and bruises set in, the numbers quickly depleted. Then came an opportunity to train for a seven’s game against the national Jamaican women’s sevens team as part of a men’s sevens tournament being hosted in Kingston.\nThe Cayman girls (all expats) trained hard under Smudger’s tutelage but arrived at the tournament as definite underdogs. The Jamaican team possessed speed and experience but on the day in question this proved no match for the Cayman team’s discipline, structure and hard tackling and the sprinting prowess of Janie Fleming and Lorna Campbell. The Cayman team beat the Jamaican team decisively, twice in one day, which caused a major upset in the Jamaican camp. The inaugural Cayman squad returned home with a taste for victory and a strong desire to improve at sevens and develop into a full 15s squad.\nWith the small pool of players to draw on, the women’s squad focused on sevens for the next 18 months, representing Cayman at the Trinidad Sevens and the Las Vegas Midnight Sevens. Gradually numbers swelled to enable games of 10s and eventually 15s enabling Cayman to host teams from Seacoast USA, Jamaica and Queens University with the first ever National 15s game taking place against Jamaica in 2003 under the captaincy of Caroline Deegan. In those early years the girls were indebted to the succession of coaches (Richard Adams, Adam Craven and Kevin Crooks) and inspired by the enthusiasm of the first Caymanian women rugby players such as Loletta Hanna and Nathalee Curtis.\nThe exciting progress of the women’s squad in those early years was unexpectedly halted when Hurricane Ivan decimated the Cayman Islands in September 2004. Many Caymanians and expatriates alike were forced to evacuate the island for several months and the rugby club itself required extensive rebuilding and renovation. A small core of players remained on island and committed to promoting rugby and rebuilding the women’s program as soon as time and resources allowed.\nResults summary.\n\"(Full internationals only)\""

As the first stage match results amongst the teams which advanced to this stage also counted, the two groups had been predetermined, one group formed by groups A and C teams while the other was formed by groups B and D teams. In each of the two groups, the teams played once against every opponent they had not faced in the tournament (total of three matches each), adding that to the results obtained against the other two teams who also advanced from the first stage same group.

The original cast included host Kevin Harlan, with former New York Yankee player and Baltimore Orioles manager, Hank Bauer and statistician John Matthews.\nFormat.\nThe basic format of \"Baseball Sunday\" involved a round table chat about the goings on in Major League Baseball at the time. The hosts would also take calls from the listeners. Radio highlights from that particular Sunday's Major League Baseball action would be mixed in for good measure. \"Baseball Sunday\" was a precursor of sorts to ESPN's \"Baseball Tonight\", which debuted in 1990.\nHosts.\nAs previously mentioned, the initial host of \"Baseball Sunday\" was Kevin Harlan, who was also joined by regulars Bill James and Hal Bodley (of \"USA Today\"). Around 1990, Harlan left the program and was replaced by Joe Garagiola. What then became known as \"Baseball Sunday with Joe Garagiola\" was created by Shane Hackett and Miles McMillan. It was owned and produced by United Syndications Associates and aired on over 200 radio stations."

He also worked the All-Star Game in 1972 and 1977, calling balls and strikes for the second contest. Kunkel's experience as the plate umpire is documented in the MLB official highlight film of the 1977 All-Star Game.\nNotable games.\nOn August 10, 1971, Kunkel was the home plate umpire when Harmon Killebrew hit his 500th career home run. As a pitcher, Kunkel had given up three home runs to Killebrew during the 1961 season.\nOn September 28, 1974, Kunkel was the first base umpire when Nolan Ryan pitched the third of his record seven no-hitters. On September 28, 1975, exactly one year later, Kunkel was behind the plate when four Oakland Athletics pitchers—Vida Blue, Glenn Abbott, Paul Lindblad and Rollie Fingers—combined to no-hit the California Angels, 5–0.\nOn September 30, 1980, Kunkel caught pitcher Rick Honeycutt of the Seattle Mariners using a thumb tack to illegally alter baseballs during a game against the Kansas City Royals.

Kunkel ordered the boxes redrawn by the grounds crew, and Wills was later fined and suspended.\nDeath.\nKunkel died on May 4, 1985 of cancer at age 48 in Red Bank, New Jersey. During his battle with cancer, Kunkel was featured in \"Safe at Home\", a 10-minute film released by the American Cancer Society. Regarding his recovery, Kunkel stated that \"I'm living proof that there's life after cancer. ... My problem never enters my mind until someone brings it up.\"\nLegacy.\nKunkel's uniform number 9, assigned when the American League adopted umpire numbers in 1980, was retired after his death until the umpiring staffs were unified in 2000, when it was assigned to Brian Gorman.\nAt the time of his death, Kunkel was one of only two umpires still using the outside chest protector, Jerry Neudecker being the other.\nKunkel was the last MLB player who later became a major league umpire.\nIn addition to his son Jeff Kunkel playing in MLB; son Kevin Kunkel, both had minor league playing careers. Father-and-son Bill and Jeff were featured on a Topps baseball card in 1985, # 136.\nThere is a park named in Kunkel's honor in the Leonardo section of Middletown Township, New Jersey, where he had been a longtime resident."

He never returned to the majors, though he continued to play in the minor leagues in 1983, with the Pittsburgh Pirates AAA affiliate in Hawaii and in 1984 with the A's in Tacoma and Modesto. During that time, Robinson was a player-coach for the Modesto A's in , where he worked with future stars Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco.\nEarly years.\nBruce Robinson was born in La Jolla, California, a beach community within the city of San Diego.

        "title": "1999 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1999 Rose Bowl was the 85th Rose Bowl game and was played on Friday January 1, 1999, at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, California. It was a college football bowl game at the end of the 1998 NCAA Division I-A football season. Wisconsin defeated UCLA by a score of 38–31. Ron Dayne of Wisconsin was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game. He tied a modern Rose Bowl record with four touchdowns. This was the first year that the Rose Bowl became part of the Bowl Championship Series, ending a long-standing agreement between the Big Ten and the \"West Representative\" (PCC/AAWU) and the first year that the game was branded with corporate sponsorship. Unlike the other bowl games, the sponsor was not added to the title of the game, but instead as a presenter, so it became known as The Rose Bowl Game presented by AT&amp;T.\nBowl Championship Series.\nThe Bowl Coalition was restructured into the Bowl Alliance for the 1995 season, involving five conferences (reduced to four for the 1996 season) and three bowls. The championship game rotated among the three bowls. However, it still didn't include the Pac-10 or Big Ten champs.\nMichigan and Nebraska split the National Championship during the 1997 season after never having met on the field. After a protracted round of negotiations, the Bowl Alliance was reconfigured into the Bowl Championship Series for the 1998 season. The Pasadena Tournament of Roses, which operates the Rose Bowl Game, agreed to release the Big Ten or Pac-10 champions if necessary to facilitate a national championship game. In return, the Rose Bowl was added to the yearly national championship game rotation.\nTeams.\nUCLA Bruins.\nBeginning in November, the Bruins were ranked number 2 behind Tennessee. It appeared that they would face the Volunteers in the BCS championship. The UCLA Bruins went undefeated through the 1998 football season until their final game. In late September, Miami had been forced to postpone their game with UCLA due to Hurricane Georges. The game was rescheduled for December 5 and for the #2-ranked Bruins, a trip to the National Championship game was at stake. The Hurricanes put up over 600 yards of total offense and the result was a stunning 49–45 Miami victory. Instead of advancing to the first Bowl Championship series game (the 1999 Fiesta Bowl) as a contender for the national championship, the Bruins \"settled\" for the Rose Bowl, something that previously had been the ultimate goal of the Pacific-10 conference champion.\nWisconsin Badgers.\nWisconsin ended up in a three-way tie for first place in the Big Ten with Michigan and Ohio State. All three teams had 7–1 conference records and were conference co-champions. Michigan had defeated Wisconsin 27–10 in \"The Big House\". Wisconsin and Ohio State did not meet. At the time, the Big Ten awarded the Rose Bowl invitation to the tied team which had gone the longest period of time without an invitation: Michigan had been in the 1998 Rose Bowl, Ohio State had been in the 1997 Rose Bowl, while Wisconsin had last been in the 1994 Rose Bowl.\nThe circumstances of this selection and the fact that UCLA had so recently fallen from the lofty #2 in the nation status led many to deride and seriously underestimate the Badgers; most notably, ESPN analyst Craig James with his infamous declaration that Wisconsin was \"the worst team to ever play in the Rose Bowl\".\nGame summary.\nThe weather was sunny and 74 degrees and the crowd of 93,872 at the Rose Bowl was described by one reporter as a \"sea of red […] with a few small breaks of Bruin blue.\"\nIn the first half, both teams scored three touchdowns, with UCLA answering each of the first two Wisconsin scores and then taking its only lead of the game (21–14) in the second quarter. After re-tying the game, Wisconsin would add a field goal to account for the halftime score of 24–21.\nAll six touchdowns had come on lengthy drives, with UCLA's best starting position being its own 35-yard line and Wisconsin's its own 25. The Badgers' scoring plays were emblematic of their style of play: Relying heavily on the run (running the ball 48 times in the game as opposed to just 17 passing attempts), they scored three times on rushes by Ron Dayne, including a 54-yard run for the first touchdown of the game. UCLA on the other hand, scored its three first-half touchdowns on passing plays, including one thrown by wide receiver Freddie Mitchell on a trick play.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Wisconsin continued the scoring trend, going ahead 31–21 on Ron Dayne's fourth touchdown run of the game. This would, however, turn out to be the last offensive score by the Badgers.\nUCLA would then sustain two long drives of its own. However, the Bruins lost the ball on a fumble on the Wisconsin 6-yard line before scoring a touchdown on their next drive on a 10-yard run by Jermaine Lewis to cut the Wisconsin lead to 31–28.\nThe eventual \"clinching\" play occurred on UCLA's next drive, at the start of the fourth quarter, when Cade McNown threw an interception to Jamar Fletcher, which was returned 47 yards for a Wisconsin touchdown to extend the Badgers' lead to 38–28.\nOn its next possession, UCLA came up short on a fake punt, but subsequently regained possession after a Wisconsin fumble on a bad snap. Starting from the Wisconsin 33, the Bruins went deep on their first play, which resulted in Jamar Fletcher being called for pass interference on Danny Farmer in the endzone. However, UCLA had to settle for a field goal to make the score 38–31 Wisconsin with 6:05 left in the game.\nOn their last possession, the Bruins allowed a \"sack of McNown on fourth-and-3 at the Wisconsin 47-yard line with 59 seconds remaining.\" This sealed the victory for the Badgers, who won despite being outgained 538–497 in terms of offensive yards and not scoring an offensive touchdown for the last 26 1/2 minutes of the game.\nAftermath.\nRose Bowl records.\nEight Rose Bowl records were set or tied in the game.\nWith his four touchdowns, Ron Dayne tied three modern Rose Bowl touchdown records: most touchdowns, most rushing touchdowns and most career rushing touchdowns. With 24 points, he also tied most points in game and career. These records are shared along with Eric Ball from the 1986 Rose Bowl and Sam Cunningham from the 1973 Rose Bowl. Vince Young would also join this group following the 2006 Rose Bowl, and the records still stand as of the 2015 Rose Bowl. Dayne was named the Rose Bowl MVP for 1999 and would repeat this feat in the 2000 Rose Bowl, becoming one of only three (now, four) players to ever repeat as a Rose Bowl MVP (and the only player from the Big Ten Conference).\nFor the teams, the following records were broken, but no longer stand."

Hosted by England for the second time, it was the fifth edition of the Women's Cricket World Cup, and came over four years after the preceding 1988 World Cup in Australia.\nThe tournament was organised by the International Women's Cricket Council (IWCC), with matches played over 60 overs. It was \"run on a shoestring\", and was close to being cancelled until a £90,000 donation was received from the Foundation for Sport and the Arts. England won the tournament for a second time, defeating New Zealand in the final by 67 runs. A record eight teams participated, with Denmark, India, and the West Indies joining the five teams from the 1988 edition. Denmark and the West Indies were making their tournament debuts. England's Jan Brittin was the tournament's highest run-scorer, while her captain Karen Smithies and New Zealand's Julie Harris led the tournament in wickets.\nWarm-up matches.\nEleven warm-up matches were played against various English teams, all before the beginning of the tournament.\nFinal.\nThe final at Lord's was attended by 4,500 spectators, including the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, John Major. The match was broadcast live on BBC's \"Grandstand\", and England's victory received front-page and back-page coverage in all of the major national newspapers, a first for women's cricket. England's performance was often contrasted with that of the English men's side, which had lost the 1993 Ashes series to Australia less than a week earlier. The Women's Cricket Association (WCA) was praised for its management of the final, but the increased media coverage also led to some criticism of its role in the sport as a whole.\nStatistics.\nMost runs.\nThe top five runscorers are included in this table, ranked by runs scored, then by batting average, then alphabetically by surname.\nSource: CricketArchive\nMost wickets.\nThe top five wicket takers are listed in this table, ranked by wickets taken and then by bowling average.\nSource: CricketArchive"

        "text": "William F. Greenwood (April 19, 1857 – May 2, 1902) was an American Major League Baseball player (mostly a second baseman) for six seasons from to . He played more games at second base than any other left-handed player.\nCareer.\nGreenwood was fast and was often among the league leaders in stolen bases, but he usually hit for a mediocre batting average. He was a left-handed infielder, not entirely uncommon in the 19th century, and he is the all-time leader in games played at second base by a left-hander with 538. He also played 30 games at shortstop.\nFor the season, he signed and was playing for the Merrits of Camden, New Jersey, when Charlie Byrne of a fellow league team, the Brooklyn Grays, bought his contract, along with other Merrits Sam Kimber, Charlie Householder, Frank Fennelly, and Jack Corcoran. He finished out the year and transitioned with the team over to the American Association, where they would be known as the Atlantics.\nPlaying in the AA until 1890, Greenwood changed teams every year, except for 1887-88, when he played two seasons for the Baltimore Orioles. His 1887 season with Baltimore was one of his best; he hit .263, recorded 65 RBI, and stole 71 bases. During an 1887 home game, Greenwood was on the receiving end of a collision at second base from St. Louis Browns outfielder Curt Welch. The collision angered Baltimore fans, and St. Louis players had to run off the field to avoid the irate fans. \nThe next year, his batting average fell to .191 and he did not hit above .225 again in the major leagues.\nGreenwood thought that his biggest struggle as a left-handed middle infielder was fielding ground balls, but he also had a problem that would be expected of a left-hander: making quick, accurate throws to first base. Compounding his problems was the fact that he liked to drink to excess, so he sometimes got on the bad side of a manager with his behavior.\nPost-career.\nGreenwood died in his hometown of Philadelphia at the age of 45. He had a heart attack while discussing the Athletics game that had been played that day. He is interred at the Mount Moriah Cemetery in Philadelphia."

        "text": "The American Society of Golf Course Architects (abbreviated as ASGCA) is a professional organization of golf course designers in America. Founded in 1946, its members are actively involved in the design of new courses and the renovation of existing courses in the United States and Canada. One of its founders was noted golf course architect Robert White. The abbreviation is typically referenced at the end of a person's name when documenting or discussing golf course architecture.\nAbout ASGCA.\nFounded in 1946, the American Society of Golf Course Architects (ASGCA) is the oldest professional organization of golf course designers in America.\nAll ASGCA members have completed of a minimum of five major golf course projects and are peer-reviewed by the ASGCA membership.\nOver the past several years ASGCA has published three editions of \"An Environmental Approach to Golf Course Development\" to help educate permitting boards, town councils, developers, media, and the general public about the positive role golf courses can play in preserving the environment. Released in 2008, the current, third edition highlights 18 case studies that showcase success stories dealing with a variety of sensitive habitats.\nHistory.\nThis excerpt from the 1947 ASGCA minutes confirms ASGCA and the golf industry have faced some of the same issues for decades. In the following, Mr. Richard Tufts of Pinehurst addresses the 10 assembled charter members regarding the work of the \"Implements and Balls Committee\" of the USGA:\n\"This problem primarily concerns the flight of the golf ball, of course, which is why I thought you as golf course architects would be interested in it essentially. It is something the USGA has been working on for a good many years. Mr. Fownes, who is president here (Pinehurst), was very active as chairman of this committee when he held that position prior to his service as President of the USGA, and he did a great deal of work on this whole problem of the golf ball. I've been very much interested in it since I've been Chairman of the committee. We feel that a golf course is designed for a certain type of shot to the green, and that as you increase the length of the tee shot, you throw the golf course all out of scale. Therefore, it spoils the pleasure of the play to have this continual increase in the flight of the ball. We feel that the question involves not only the ball but also the equipment of the game; that possibly the shaft had something to do with the increased length of the ball. We've done a lot of work in Chicago with our machine there in testing the ball. Since our tests first started back in 1942 we haven't observed much increase in the flight of the ball, it's been pretty constant. The manufacturers say pretty much the same thing: that they haven't changed the ball very much, and in their opinions it hasn't increased.\n\"However, that doesn't mean that it might not increase in the future. It's quite possible that improvements to the present ball have just about reached 100 percent efficiency under the present method of manufacture, but it's quite possible that there might be improvements in plastics, or other material, that would greatly increase the flight of the present ball. We feel that it would be a very serious thing for the game, and we'd like the support of your association in maintaining the present ball; helping us with this...\n\"At the conclusion of Mr. Tuft's speech, Mr. Thompson made a motion that the Society send a resolution to the USGA to the effect that as a body the members pledge their support to the rules and regulations adopted by the USGA, and that the Society recognizes the USGA as the ruling body of golf in the United States. Mr. Bell seconded the motion and it passed unanimously...\n\"The Society then appointed a committee of two to work on this resolution: Mr. Donald J. Ross and Mr. Robert Trent Jones. Mr. Jones was appointed delegate to the USGA's annual meeting.\"\nMembership.\nMembership in ASGCA signifies that an architect is a qualified profession golf course architect. Every ASGCA member must complete a two-year application process and prove that they have acquired sound technical training, have no less than eight years of practical experience in golf course architecture, have designed at least five 18-hole golf course equivalents and is recognized by other ASGCA members as a competent professional golf course architect.\nPeer Review.\nASGCA members are very involved in the review of each potential member's application. Four of the five representative courses submitted on an application are evaluated in person by an ASGCA member. The member studies plans of the course, interviews construction personnel, club management and either walks or plays the course with the applicant.\nEach applicant must also be sponsored by three ASGCA members. The sponsors are members who can personally vouch for the character, professional integrity and high level of applied architecture skill of the applicant.\nCode of Ethics.\nIn addition, ASGCA members abide by standards of professional practice and a stringent code of ethics. The code of ethics set standards for the golf course architect's role in contract negotiations and their responsibilities to the client. Many public agencies and entities have recognized that the ASGCA membership constitutes the highest professional standards in golf course design.\nDescription of Membership.\nA member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects is one who by virtue of their knowledge of the game, training, experience, vision and inherent ability, is in all ways qualified to design and prepare specifications for a course of functional and aesthetic perfection. They are further qualified to execute and oversee the implementation on the ground of his plans and specifications to create an enjoyable layout that challenges golfers of all abilities and exemplifies the highest standards and traditions of golf. They will counsel in all phases of the work to protect the best interest of their client.\nEach member of the American Society of Golf Course Architects is engaged primarily in golf course architecture, and their qualifications have satisfied the Board of Governors in all respects.&lt;ref name=\"http://asgca.org/our-members\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;\nDonald Ross Award Winners.\nThe Donald Ross Award, ASGCA's highest honor, is presented annually to an individual who has made significant and lasting contributions to the profession of golf course architecture."

At that time, the CBC only had rights to the Montreal Canadiens and Toronto Maple Leafs' games; home games only during the season and all games in the playoffs. However, with both the Canadiens and Maple Leafs eliminated in the semi-finals, the CBC's worst nightmare became reality. The CBC had to conceive a way to carry the Finals between the Chicago Black Hawks and Detroit Red Wings or face public revolt. According to lore, the CBC found a way to link their Windsor viewers as having a vested interest in the Finals with the across the river Red Wings. Thus, CBC was able to carry the series after inking special contracts with the Red Wings and Black Hawks as a service to the Windsor market. From Windsor, CBC linked the signal to Toronto and they relayed the coverage Dominion-wide. From there, Canadians were able to see the Finals with nary a glitch in the coverage."

        "text": "The goalie blocker is a rectangular piece of equipment worn by goaltenders in the sports of ice hockey, roller hockey, rink hockey, broomball, and ringette. It is generally worn on the dominant hand. This article deals chiefly with blockers worn by goalies who play winter sports.\nThe blocker is a close-fitting glove augmented on the back of the hand, wrist and part of the forearm by a rectangular \"block\" of padding and fabric (leather or synthetic). Goaltenders hold their stick in that hand and use the padded rectangle to block shots -- bouncing them away from the net, as opposed to holding them in the catching glove. Experienced goalies can \"steer\" the shot by angling the blocker as the puck strikes. The padding also serves to protect the hand and lower forearm of the goaltender."

        "text": "James Gordon Pritchard (born 21 July 1979) is an Australian-Canadian professional rugby union and rugby league footballer, who currently plays his club rugby union for Ampthill in National League 1 following short spells with Old Albanian and Coventry (where he was player-coach). Pritchard is best known for his time with Bedford Blues, where he spent 12 seasons across two spells with the club, and he is the club's record points scorer with 2,883 points in all competitions, including 99 tries. He is also the RFU Championship all-time top points scorer with 2,673 points from 251 league and play-off games while playing for Bedford Blues and Plymouth Albion (a figure that includes 94 tries), as a fullback, wing or centre. Pritchard has played internationally for , with whom he appeared in four Rugby World Cups, and is his countries all-time top points scorer with 607 points.\nYouth and early amateur career.\nPritchard was born in Parkes, New South Wales, Australia and started in rugby league football at the age of 13. He played for NRL side the Parramatta Eels in the Under-19 age division after he left school, before changing to play rugby union and joining the Randwick District Rugby Union Club in 1999 and winning the Citibank/MasterCard Cup with them in 2000. In his first year of First grade with the club he also picked up the Ron Don Trophy for Most Improved as well as being runner-up in the Sydney Morning Herald Rookie of The Year Awards. He also finished the top points scorer in the competition with 183 points in ten games.\nProfessional career.\nBedford Blues.\nJames Pritchard captained the Blues in its 125th Season – one of the most successful in its history when the side finished second in the Championship and made the playoffs semifinals and the final of the British and Irish Cup. He played mainly at fullback or the wing but whatever number he wore on his shirt his authority and influence on the team was clear. For him personally, 2010–11 was probably his best in a Bedford career that started when he was signed in 2001 from the Randwick club in Australia. He broke the club points scoring record with 403, the first player ever to pass 400; he passed 300 for the third time, the only one ever to do that, and he joined Andy Finnie as the only Bedford player to score 2000 points in his Bedford career. James Pritchard first broke the club's points scoring record with 386 in his second season with the club then left to pursue international honours with Canada before returning in 2006 and making an indelible mark on the history of the Blues.\nJames Pritchard has played more international matches as a Bedford player then anyone save 'Budge' Rodgers. By the end of the 2010–11 Championship season in England he had played 33 times for Canada – 28 of them as a Bedford player – and had scored 332 international points. And he was in such form as captain of the Blues, having just set another record, that more caps looked certain to follow. Add to that 181 appearances and the second highest career total of points in 125 years – including 65 tries – and its clear he belongs among Bedfords all-time greats. Australian born, with a Canadian grandfather and a grandmother from Northamptonshire, he was signed by Colin Jackson from the Randwick club with a reputation as a points machine – and he didn't disappoint, finishing as top point scorer in all eight seasons he played up to, and including 2011–12. In his second season, 2002–03, he broke the club record with 386, in league and cup, in just 27 games, securing the Player of the Season award on the way. His 374 in the league that season was still a record in 2011 when he regained the overall club record with 403. His early success convinced him to try to make the Canada squad for the 2003 World Cup and so he left Bedford to join the Prairie Fire in the Canadian Super League. He made his international debut in a non-cap match against the New Zealand Maori in Calgary in July 2003 and then played in 3 capped matches in a Pan-American tournament in Buenos Aires, Argentina in August before making the World Cup squad and playing against Wales and Tonga in Australia.\nPlymouth Albion.\nHe joined Plymouth Albion in August 2004 and scored 319 points for them in 29 consecutive appearances. His last match for Albion was against Bedford in the 2005 Powergen Challenge Shield Final at Twickenham where he broke his collarbone in the 16th minute.\nBedford Blues.\nAfter 3 years away and with spells at Perpignan in France and Northampton Saints, James Pritchard returned to Goldington Road for the 2006–07 season and scored 303 points in that campaign, and once again picked up the Player of the Season award for the second time in his career. He was recalled to the Canadian team in 2006 setting a new record of 36 points in a match against the US and then played in all four pool games in the 2007 World Cup in France. On 7 May 2011, Pritchard passed the 400 point mark for the 2010–11 RFU Championship season, the first time this has been achieved by a Bedford Blues player in their 125-year history. He finished the season with 403 points. The 2011–12 season was again another successful season for Pritchard, again surpassing the 200 point mark in the league, as well as captaining the side to the s of the Championship for the second year running only to be beaten by eventual winners London Welsh. For the third time in his career he was named Player of the season for the club.\nInternational career.\nWith a grandfather from Ruthilda, Saskatchewan, Pritchard came to Canada to play for the Rugby Canada Super League side Prairie Fire in 2003, and to pursue a 2003 Rugby World Cup place with Canada. Pritchard made his international debut a few months later for Canada in a non cap match against the New Zealand Maori in Calgary in July 2003 and then played in 3 capped matches in a pan American tournament in Buenos Aires, Argentina in August before making the World Cup squad for the 2003 Rugby World Cup, where he scored conversions against and .\nAfter a few years in the rugby wilderness, Pritchard was recalled for Canada in 2006, setting a new Canadian scoring record of 29 points in a World Cup Qualifying game against Barbados. He then surpassed that against the United States in Canada's 2007 Rugby World Cup – Americas qualification game in Newfoundland in August 2006, with 36 points from three tries, three penalties and six conversions. In that same year Pritchard was also voted Canada's Player of the Year by Canadian Rugby News.\nPritchard was also selected for the Canadian squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup, and was Canada's main kicker for the tournament, in which he played in all four of Canada's pool games against Wales, , and .\nIn 2011 Pritchard was once again selected for the Canadian Squad for the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Making this his 3rd Rugby World Cup for the Canadians. He played fullback in Canada's first 3 games against , France and Japan, before being ruled out for selection against the All Blacks due to concussion he picked up in the previous game against Japan.\nIn 2015 Pritchard was left off of the roster for the World Cup as coach Crowley explained he had more options for kickers who also offered a more versatile fullback than Pritchard. Shortly after that James Pritchard announced his retirement from international rugby. Pritchard has set the record for most points scored for Canada. He has a total of 607 points from 18 tries, 103 conversions and 104 penalties. On 28 September, Pritchard came out of retirement haven been called up to the Canadian squad replacing the injured Liam Underwood.\nHonours and records.\nRFU Championship\nBedford Blues\nCanada"

Packers running back Ryan Grant, who fumbled twice in the first quarter, ended up with a franchise playoff record 201 rushing yards and three touchdowns.\nBoth of Grant's fumbles in the first quarter were converted into Seattle touchdowns. On the first play of the game, Seahawks linebacker Lofa Tatupu recovered Grant's fumble and returned it 12 yards to the Green Bay 1-yard line, setting up Shaun Alexander's 1-yard touchdown run on the next play. Then shortly after the ensuing kickoff, Grant, who only fumbled once during the regular season, lost another fumble which was recovered by Jordan Babineaux at the Packers 49-yard line. Five plays later, Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Bobby Engram, giving the Seahawks a 14–0 lead just four minutes into the game.\nHowever, the Packers responded with a touchdown on all of their ensuing possessions until early in the fourth quarter. First, quarterback Brett Favre completed four consecutive passes for 65 yards and finished the drive with a 15-yard touchdown pass to Greg Jennings. Then after a punt, the Packers drove 64 yards in nine plays, with Grant rushing the ball four times for 43 yards and finishing it off with a 1-yard touchdown run to tie the game.\nOn the first play of the second quarter, with heavy snow falling, Green Bay defensive end Aaron Kampman recovered a fumble from Marcus Pollard on the Seahawks 18-yard line. Following two carries for 16 yards by Grant, Favre threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jennings. Aided by a 15-yard roughing the punter penalty against Green Bay on fourth down, Seattle responded by driving to the Packers 10-yard line where Josh Brown kicked a field goal to cut the score to 21–17. But Green Bay then moved the ball 70 yards in 14 plays and scored with Grant's 3-yard touchdown run to give them a 28–17 lead at halftime.\nAfter a Seahawks punt began the second half, Favre completed a 24-yard pass to Jennings and Grant broke off a 24-yard run to the Seahawks 12-yard line, setting up Favre's 13-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Jackson. Hasselbeck responded by completing six of seven passes for 68 yards en route to another Brown field goal, but Grant's 43-yard run on the Packers next drive set up his third touchdown of the day, making the final score 42–20.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Seahawks and Packers. Green Bay won the only prior meeting 33–27 in OT in the 2003 NFC Wild Card playoffs.\nAFC: New England Patriots 31, Jacksonville Jaguars 20.\nPatriots quarterback Tom Brady threw for 263 yards and three touchdowns, while running back Laurence Maroney added 162 total yards (122 yards on the ground). Overall, New England gained 401 yards and didn't punt the ball until 31 seconds remained in the fourth quarter.\nJacksonville took the opening kickoff and went 80 yards in nine plays, featuring two receptions by Marcedes Lewis for 57 yards, on the way to David Garrard's 9-yard touchdown pass to Matt Jones. The Patriots then went on a 74-yard drive and scored with Tom Brady's 3-yard touchdown pass to Benjamin Watson. On Jacksonville's next possession, New England defensive end Ty Warren forced a fumble while sacking Garrard, and linebacker Mike Vrabel recovered it at the Jaguars 29-yard line. Several plays later, Maroney scored a 1-yard touchdown run to give New England a 14–7 lead.\nJaguars running back Maurice Jones-Drew muffed the ensuing kickoff and was downed at his own 5-yard line. The Jaguars then moved the ball 95 yards in 11 plays without even facing a third down and scored with Garrard's 6-yard touchdown pass to Ernest Wilford. For the third time in a row, New England drove deep into Jacksonville territory. But this time the drive stalled at the 17-yard line and ended with no points when Stephen Gostkowski missed a 35-yard field goal with 53 seconds left in the first half.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Brady completed seven of eight passes for 54 yards on an 82-yard drive. On the last play, he took a snap in shotgun formation with Kevin Faulk to his right, Brady jumped in the air with his arms raised to make it look like a play used by the Patriots before where Faulk took the direct snap. The Jaguars defense followed Faulk, leaving Wes Welker open in the end zone, and Brady threw him the ball for a touchdown to give the Patriots a 21–14 lead. Jacksonville responded with a drive to the New England 21-yard line, but receiver Dennis Northcutt dropped a pass on third down, forcing them to settle for a Josh Scobee 39-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–17. On New England's next drive, Jacksonville's Derek Landri was assessed a roughing-the-passer penalty, turning Welker's 6-yard catch into a 21-yard gain. Maroney gained 40 yards with his next two carries, and following two more Welker receptions, Brady threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to Watson giving New England a 28–17 lead.\nAn unnecessary roughness penalty and a 25-yard reception by Reggie Williams on Jacksonville's next drive set up a 25-yard field goal by Scobee, which cut the Jaguars deficit to one touchdown, 28–20. On the second play after the kickoff, Brady completed a 52-yard strike to Donté Stallworth, setting up Gostkowski's second field goal attempt to put New England back up by two scores, 31–20.\nThen, with 3:46 left in the game, Pats safety Rodney Harrison, intercepted a pass from Garrard at the Patriots' 31-yard line, ending any hope of a Jacksonville comeback. Harrison's interception was his seventh career postseason pick, a Patriots record. This was also his fourth consecutive postseason game with an interception, tying an NFL record held by Aeneas Williams.\nWith this win, the Patriots advanced to the AFC title game for the second year in a row and extended their perfect record to 17–0, matching the final record of the 1972 Miami Dolphins.\nThis would be the Jacksonville Jaguars' last postseason appearance until 2017.\nThis was the fourth postseason meeting between the Jaguars and Patriots, with New England winning two of the prior three meetings, including 28–3 in the 2005 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nSunday, January 13, 2008.\nAFC: San Diego Chargers 28, Indianapolis Colts 24.\nDespite the loss of starting quarterback Philip Rivers and running back LaDainian Tomlinson (the NFL's leading rusher during the season), San Diego still managed to defeat the defending Super Bowl champion Colts in what would be the final game in the RCA Dome.\nThe Colts started out the game on a 76-yard drive and scored on Peyton Manning's 25-yard touchdown pass to tight end Dallas Clark. Then Kelvin Hayden intercepted a pass from Rivers on the Colts 24-yard line and the Colts moved the ball to the San Diego 40-yard line. However, Indianapolis receiver Marvin Harrison, playing in his first game back from an injury in nearly three months, fumbled the ball while being tackled by Antonio Cromartie, and Marlon McCree recovered it. Following the turnover, San Diego drove 78 yards and tied the game with Rivers' 14-yard touchdown pass to Vincent Jackson. Manning responded by completing three passes for 42 yards on a 44-yard drive that ended with an Adam Vinatieri field goal to give the Colts a 10–7 lead. Both teams blew scoring opportunities on their next drives. First the Chargers drove to the Indianapolis 31-yard line, only to have Nate Kaeding miss a 48-yard field goal. Then the Colts advanced to the Chargers 35-yard line, but on their last play of the half, Manning's pass was intercepted by Cromartie. Cromartie's 89-yard touchdown return was called back by a holding penalty, but he managed to prevent the Colts from scoring and it remained 10–7 at halftime.\nThe Chargers took the second half kickoff and quickly took the lead with a 30-yard touchdown catch from Chris Chambers. Once again the Colts drove into Chargers territory, moving the ball all the way to the San Diego 4-yard line. But on third down and 3, Manning's pass was intercepted by Eric Weddle. However, the Chargers could only move the ball to their own 6-yard line and T. J. Rushing returned their punt 12-yards to midfield. This time the Colts drove 50 yards and scored with Manning's 9-yard touchdown pass to Reggie Wayne. Wayne was initially ruled out of bounds at the 7, but a Colts challenge showed he remained in bounds on the way to the touchdown, and the Colts took the lead, 17–14. On the Chargers ensuing drive, Rivers threw a 22-yard completion to Chambers and followed it up with a 56-yard touchdown pass to Darren Sproles, a special teams returner who was brought in on offense as an extra receiver.\nWith 10:50 left in the fourth quarter, Indianapolis retook the lead with Manning's 55-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Gonzalez, who caught the ball along the left sideline and narrowly managed to keep his feet in bounds en route to a score, which was upheld after a Chargers challenge. But San Diego, now led by second-string quarterback Billy Volek, drove 78 yards in eight plays and scored with Volek's 1-yard touchdown run, giving them a 28–24 lead with 4:50 left in regulation. Manning led the Colts down the field, moving the ball 70 yards and converting a fourth down and 5 with a 16-yard completion to Clark. But he threw three consecutive incompletions from the Chargers 7-yard line, turning the ball over on downs. Indianapolis' defense managed to force a punt, but the Colts turned the ball over on downs again after Dallas Clark's fourth-down drop with 53 seconds left, and San Diego ran out the rest of the clock to close the RCA Dome for good.\nThis was the second postseason meeting between the Chargers and Colts, with Indianapolis winning the only prior meeting 35–20 in the 1995 AFC Wild Card playoffs.\nNFC: New York Giants 21, Dallas Cowboys 17.\nWith nine seconds left in the game, Giants cornerback R. W. McQuarters intercepted a Tony Romo pass in the end zone to preserve a victory over the Cowboys, who had defeated New York twice during the season. The win marked the first time in 20 years that the NFC's #1 seeded team had been eliminated in the divisional round, the first time it had happened since the current playoff format was instituted in 1990, and sent the Cowboys home with their sixth consecutive playoff loss since 1996. The Giants advanced to their first NFC Championship Game since 2000 with the win and won their ninth consecutive game away from Giants Stadium. This would also turn out to be the final playoff game at Texas Stadium.\nThe Giants scored on their opening drive when Eli Manning threw a pass to Amani Toomer, who caught the pass on a curl route at the Dallas 39 before spinning away from the defense and running down left sideline for a 52-yard touchdown reception. Following an exchange of punts, Dallas running back Marion Barber rushed twice for 56 yards on a 9-play, 95-yard drive that ended with Romo's 5-yard touchdown pass to Terrell Owens. Then after a punt, Dallas scored on one of the longest drives in playoff history, moving the ball 90 yards in 20 plays and taking 10:28 off the clock. Barber capped the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run to give Dallas a 14–7 lead with 53 seconds left in the second quarter. The Giants responded by scoring a second touchdown, going 74 yards in 46 seconds. Ahmad Bradshaw ran for 13 yards, Manning completed two passes to Steve Smith for 34 yards, and a facemask penalty added another 15 yards. Following a 19-yard reception by tight end Kevin Boss, Manning threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Toomer to tie the game with seven seconds remaining in the half.\nDallas took the second half kickoff and retook the lead with a 62-yard drive that ended with a field goal by Nick Folk. The rest of the quarter was scoreless, but with 53 seconds left, McQuarters' 25-yard punt return gave New York the ball on the Cowboys 37-yard line. Five plays later, Brandon Jacobs scored a 1-yard touchdown run, giving the Giants a 21–17 lead. After an exchange of punts, Dallas got the ball on their own 44-yard line with seven minutes left in the game. But following several penalties, the Cowboys could only move the ball to their 49 and had to punt. Their defense managed to force New York to punt again after only three plays and Patrick Crayton returned it eight yards, giving them a first down with 1:50 left to play, one timeout, and the ball on the New York 48-yard line. Romo threw a 9-yard pass to Barber and an 18-yard completion to Jason Witten at the 27-yard line. The Cowboys, however, only managed to gain four more yards and on fourth down Romo threw an interception to McQuarters in the end zone to clinch the victory for the Giants, who ran out the clock from there.\nThis was the first postseason meeting between the Giants and Cowboys.\nConference Championships.\nSunday, January 20, 2008.\nAFC: New England Patriots 21, San Diego Chargers 12.\nDespite three interceptions from Tom Brady, the Patriots still managed to defeat San Diego, holding them to four field goals while Laurence Maroney rushed for 122 yards and a touchdown for the second game in a row. With this win, the Patriots became the first NFL team to start with an 18–0 record and advanced to their fourth Super Bowl appearance in seven years.\nWith just over five minutes left in the first quarter, Chargers corner Quentin Jammer intercepted a pass from Brady on the Patriots 40-yard line, setting up a 26-yard field goal by Nate Kaeding. New England responded by driving 65 yards and scoring with a 1-yard Maroney touchdown run to take a 7–3 lead.\nKaeding kicked a 23-yard field goal in the second quarter to cut the score to 7–6, but after a punt, Asante Samuel intercepted a pass from Philip Rivers and returned it 10 yards to the Chargers 24-yard line. One play later, Brady's 12-yard touchdown pass to Jabar Gaffney increased their lead to 14–6. Later on, a 26-yard run by Darren Sproles moved the ball to the New England 34-yard line. But once again, the Patriots defense kept San Diego out of the end zone, stopping them on third and 1 and forcing them to settle for another Kaeding field goal, making the score 14–9 at halftime.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, Brady threw his second interception of the game, this one to Drayton Florence at the New England 49-yard line. San Diego then moved the ball to the 4-yard line, but on third and 1, linebacker Junior Seau tackled Michael Turner for a 2-yard loss and the Chargers had to settle for Kaeding's fourth field goal. New England responded with a drive to the San Diego 2-yard line, with Maroney gaining 39 yards on four running plays, but Chargers cornerback Antonio Cromartie ended the drive by intercepting Brady in the end zone.\nOn their first drive of the fourth quarter, New England moved the ball 67 yards and scored with Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Wes Welker, making the score 21–12. Following a Chargers punt, the Patriots ended the game with a 15-play drive that took the final 9:13 off the game clock.\nThis was the third postseason meeting (and second consecutive) between the Chargers and Patriots. Both teams have split the prior two meetings. New England won last season's postseason meeting 24–21 in the 2006 AFC Divisional playoffs.\nNFC: New York Giants 23, Green Bay Packers 20 (OT).\nSeventeen years to the day after their win over the 49ers in the 1990 NFC Championship Game, the Giants won the 2007 NFC Championship Game. And seventeen years to the day that Matt Bahr kicked the winning field goal to send the Giants to the Super Bowl, Giants kicker Lawrence Tynes did exactly the same thing. New York won its fourth NFC Championship Game in as many tries, and won their tenth consecutive game away from home.\nFor the third playoff game in a row, Giants quarterback Eli Manning didn't throw a single interception, finishing the game with 254 yards. His top target was Plaxico Burress, who set a franchise postseason record with 11 receptions for 154 yards. Donald Driver was the Packers top receiver with five catches for 141 yards.\nThe game was played in frigid conditions, with a gametime temperature of and a wind chill of . The Giants drove twice into Packers territory early, but were unable to score a touchdown on either drive and had to settle for two Tynes field goals. On the kickoff following the second field goal Packers return man Koren Robinson misplayed the ball and was forced to chase after it. Tramon Williams, the other returner on the play, recovered the ball at the Packers' 10-yard line. On the first play of the ensuing drive Brett Favre responded by hitting Donald Driver on a 90-yard touchdown pass, which was the longest play in Green Bay postseason history and gave them a 7–6 lead. The Packers extended the lead to 10–6 on a second quarter Mason Crosby field goal and kept that lead into the half.\nThe Giants got the ball to start the second half and drove the ball 69 yards for a score, a one-yard run into the end zone by Brandon Jacobs. On the play prior to the touchdown Jacobs fumbled the ball at the one-yard line but tight end Kevin Boss of the Giants recovered. The Packers committed four penalties on the drive, one negating an Al Harris interception and another a roughing the passer penalty on a failed third down conversion.\nWilliams' 49-yard return on the ensuing kickoff put the Packers in New York territory to start their response. The Giants appeared to stop the Packers drive after Driver caught a pass short of the first down, but Sam Madison was called for a personal foul which gave Green Bay a first down at the Giants' 12-yard line. On the next play Favre hit Donald Lee for a touchdown to retake the lead.\nAlmost as quickly as the Packers scored, the Giants answered right back as Manning was given the ball at his own 43-yard line thanks to a short kick from Crosby and a 33-yard return from Domenik Hixon. Seven plays later, the Giants re-took the lead as Ahmad Bradshaw scored from four yards away.\nOnce again, however, Favre and the Packers went down the field and into Giants territory, reaching the 31-yard line. On the second play of the fourth quarter, however, Favre threw a pass that R. W. McQuarters of the Giants intercepted and attempted to return. As he did so, Ryan Grant stripped the ball from McQuarters and it fell into the arms of Packers right tackle Mark Tauscher. The sequence netted the Packers 12 yards, as Tauscher's recovery gave Green Bay the ball at the New York 19-yard line and a fresh set of downs.\nHowever, Green Bay did not gain a yard in three plays and Crosby was called on to kick a game-tying field goal, which he converted. The Giants then attempted to drive down the field and score on their third consecutive drive, and got into position for a go-ahead field goal. Tynes, however, missed from 43 yards and the game remained tied at 20.\nNeither the Packers nor the Giants had any success moving the ball on their next series, resulting in the Packers punting twice and the Giants once. On the second Green Bay punt McQuarters fumbled for the second time in the game. This time, the Giants were able to recover as Hixon fell on the ball after a scrum. With 2:15 remaining and the ball at the Packers' 48, Bradshaw took a hand-off from Manning on the first play of the drive and ran all the way for the apparent go-ahead touchdown, but Chris Snee was called for holding which nullified the play. Despite the penalty the Giants continued to drive, and with the ball at the Green Bay 18-yard line Tynes was called on again for a field goal with four seconds remaining. Once again, however, he did not make the kick, instead hooking the 36-yarder wide left and forcing overtime.\nGreen Bay won the coin toss to start the extra period, but on the second play of overtime Favre's pass, which would be his last as a Packer, was intercepted by Corey Webster, who returned the ball nine yards to the Green Bay 34-yard line. The Giants gained five yards on three plays and then sent Tynes out to try his fifth field goal of the game, and his longest attempt of the day (47 yards). Just as Bahr had done seventeen years prior to the day, Tynes connected on the game-winning field goal, clinching a fourth NFC Championship for the Giants and their first since 2000. The Giants, the NFC's #5 seed, became just the second NFC wild card team ever to win a conference championship (the 1975 Dallas Cowboys being the other) and the third team ever (and first NFC team) to reach the Super Bowl with three road playoff wins (joining the 1985 New England Patriots and the 2005 Pittsburgh Steelers. The Green Bay Packers matched the feat three years later).\nThe game was the third ever conference championship game to be decided in overtime since the AFL/NFL merger, joining the 1986 AFC Championship Game and the 1998 NFC Championship Game. Tynes joined Rich Karlis and Morten Andersen as the only players to score the decisive points in an overtime conference championship game (coincidentally, all three players were members of the respective visiting teams in those years). Since, four more NFC Championship Games have gone to overtime, with the 2009 NFC Championship Game and the 2011 NFC Championship Game won by the Saints and Giants (Tynes would again kick the game-winning field goal in the 2011 game). Tynes also set a record for longest field goal by an opposing player in Lambeau Field playoff history with his game-winning kick. The first NFC Championship Game ending in overtime on a touchdown was the 2014 NFC Championship Game, won by the Seattle Seahawks. The 2018 NFC Championship Game also went into overtime, which was won by the Los Angeles Rams on a game-winning field goal.\nThe Packers' loss was their third in the last five Lambeau Field playoff games and marked the first time that they had ever lost an NFL/NFC Championship Game at home (losing three previous games at the Polo Grounds, Franklin Field, and Texas Stadium).\nThis was the last time the Packers hosted the NFC Championship game until the 2020 season.\nThe game was featured as one of the \"NFL's Greatest Games\" as The Chilling Championship.\nThis was the sixth postseason meeting between the Giants and Packers, with Green Bay winning four of the prior five games. The most recent meeting was won by Green Bay in the 1962 NFL Championship Game.\nSuper Bowl XLII: New York Giants 17, New England Patriots 14.\nThis was the first Super Bowl meeting between the Giants and Patriots."

        "title": "East Lake Golf Club",
        "text": "East Lake Golf Club is a private golf club 5 miles east of downtown Atlanta, Georgia. Established in 1904, it is the oldest golf course in the city. East Lake was the home course of golfer Bobby Jones and much of its clubhouse serves as a tribute to his accomplishments.\nSince 2004, East Lake has been the permanent home of The Tour Championship, the culminating event of the PGA Tour Playoffs for the FedEx Cup. The Tour Championship was first played at the course in 1998. The reigning Tour Championship and FedEx Cup champion is Viktor Hovland.\nAll proceeds from operations at East Lake Golf Club—more than $20 million to date—go to support the East Lake Foundation, which has helped transform one of the nation's worst public housing projects into a thriving community.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Atlanta Athletic Club (AAC) was formed in 1898 and due to its popularity it gained 700 members in only four years. The director of the club's athletic program was John Heisman, the famous football coach for whom the Heisman Trophy is named. In 1904 the AAC bought property at East Lake to build a country club which included a golf course. Course architect Tom Bendelow was asked to lay out the course.\nThe course's first holes were built in 1906 and were initially only seven holes, then nine. In the summer of 1907, the course was expanded to 17 holes, and later that year the 18th hole was built to complete it. Also in 1907, the first significant tournament was hosted at East Lake, the Southern Amateur, won by Nelson Whitney. In 1908, Tom Bendelow opened his \"No. 2\" course at East Lake.\nIn 1913, famed golf course architect Donald Ross redesigned the course at East Lake. The new plan provided for each of the nine holes to conclude at the clubhouse. Ross also redesigned the No. 2 course in 1928.\nA tragic fire destroyed the original clubhouse at East Lake in 1925. Following the fire, famed architect Philip Shutze, who is known for constructing the famous Swan House in Buckhead, was hired by the club to build East Lake's present day two-story Tudor style clubhouse.\nGolfer Bobby Jones is said to have played his first and last games of golf at East Lake. Jones won golf's Grand Slam in 1930, claiming the U.S. Amateur, U.S. Open, British Amateur and British Open titles in the same year. Jones's father, \"Colonel\" Robert P. Jones, served as the president of East Lake from 1937–42 and as a director for 38 years. Bobby Jones himself also served as president of East Lake from 1946–47.\nOther notable East Lake players around the same time were amateurs Watts Gunn, Perry Adair, Charlie Yates and Alexa Stirling Fraser many of whom were assisted by East Lake's golf professional Stewart Maiden.\nIn 1963, East Lake hosted the 15th biennial Ryder Cup where Arnold Palmer served as the playing captain of the winning US Team.\nRedevelopment.\nEast Lake began a downward slope when the surrounding neighborhood deteriorated in the 1960s and became victim to suburban flight. The Atlanta Athletic Club became a part of this when it sold the No. 2 course to developers and moved to its current home in Johns Creek. The original course and clubhouse were saved by a group of 25 members, led by Atlanta businessman Paul Grigsby, who purchased them and created East Lake Country Club in 1968.\nIn 1970, the East Lake Meadows public housing project was built on the site of the No. 2 golf course and became a center for poverty, drugs and violence. Middle-income homeowners fled the surrounding neighborhood, replaced by low-income renters. By the 1980s, East Lake became a mostly forgotten golf course in a seemingly hopeless neighborhood.\nThis all changed in 1993 when a local charitable foundation headed by Tom Cousins purchased East Lake with the intent to restore it as a tribute to Bobby Jones and the club's other great amateur golfers. The East Lake Foundation was also created and has used the renovation as a catalyst for revitalizing the surrounding community.\nIn 1994, Rees Jones, son of golf course architect Robert Trent Jones, restored Donald Ross' original golf course design at East Lake to its current layout.\nIn 1998 the Tour Championship was hosted at East Lake for the first time. In 2005 East Lake was named the permanent home of the Tour Championship. East Lake has hosted the tournament 23 times since 1998.\nThe clubhouse was significantly expanded in 2008 with a 20,000 square foot addition designed to match the existing 1926 structure. The manufacturer of the original B. Mifflin Hood roof tiles had gone out of business in the 1940s, but they were recreated by Ludowici. Construction began in February of that year and was completed by the Tour championship that September.\nToday.\nGolf with a Purpose.\nAll of the profits from East Lake Golf Club go to support the East Lake Foundation which in turn helps to support the health, education, safety and productivity of the East Lake neighborhood. Because of this, East Lake Golf Club's motto is \"Golf with a Purpose\".\nBased on the success of the East Lake model, a new organization, Purpose Built Communities, was established in 2009 to help fight concentrated segments of poverty in communities throughout the United States. Today, Purpose Built Communities is present in 14 cities in the US.\nCharlie Yates Golf Course.\nIn 1998 East Lake's No. 2 golf course was transformed into the Charlie Yates Golf Course, a 9-hole \"executive\" public course that provides golf education to children living in the city of Atlanta. The course was rated one of the top 10 short range courses in America by Golf Range Magazine and all profits from the course go to benefit the East Lake Foundation.\nCharlie Yates was an East Lake golfer who won the British Amateur at Royal Troon Golf Club in 1938. Charlie grew up on Second Avenue, the street which separated East Lake's main course from its No. 2 course. His boyhood hero was Bobby Jones, whom he knew and played with on the course at East Lake.\nThe Tour Championship.\nSince 2004 East Lake Golf Club has been the permanent location of the Tour Championship, the finale of the PGA Tour Playoffs and the FedEx Cup. The Tour Championship is also one of the largest supporters of the East Lake Foundation.\nEast Lake Cup.\nIn May 2015 it was announced that East Lake would be the site of a new collegiate golf tournament, the East Lake Cup. In partnership with the Golf Channel the East Lake Cup invites the top men's and women's teams from the previous season to compete in a match play championship each November. The tournament is broadcast on the Golf Channel. The inaugural East Lake Cup was played November 2 and 3, 2015. The champions of the first year's tournament were Illinois (men's) and USC (women's).\nThe 2016 the tournament added a day of stroke play to the competition with Illinois winning on the men's side and Duke winning on the women's side. The men's and women's winners of the 2017 East Lake Cup were respectively Vanderbilt University and the University of Southern California. The 2018 winner's were Auburn for the men's side and USC on the women's side.\nTournaments hosted.\nEast Lake has hosted many prestigious tournaments including:"

This is determined by the league using an evaluation system to grade each official's calls during the year. However, only officials who have worked in the league for at least five seasons and have previously worked during the playoffs are eligible to officiate in a Super Bowl. A referee cannot work the Super Bowl at that position until she or he has been a referee for at least three seasons, while also meeting the five-year minimum service requirement.\nThis has not always been the case. From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl IV, when the game was the \"AFL (American Football League)-NFL World Championship Game\", the officiating crews consisted of members from both leagues. Then for Super Bowl XXXVIII and Super Bowl XXXIX, the NFL selected the highest rated \"crew\" during the regular season. This was a reaction to several officiating mistakes during the 2002-03 playoffs, and the league felt that preserving the familiarity and cohesiveness of the officiating crews during the postseason might reduce the errors.\nList of officials.\n\"Note: A seven-official system was not used until Super Bowl XIII.

        "title": "Geography of rugby league",
        "text": "Rugby league is a full contact football code and spectator sport played in various countries around the world. It is govererned globally by the International Rugby League (IRL; previously referred to as the Rugby League International Federation).\nThe IRL divides governance of the sport across two confederations governing Asia-Pacific (APRL) and Europe (ERL). The ERL further contains two sub-branches governing The Americas and Middle East and Africa.\nAlthough one of the later football codes to be developed, the game has expanded outside of its traditionals heartlands in Australia, Northern England, Southern France, and New Zealand. As a result, many players of European, and Pacific Islander background have risen to the top professional level in the two major domestic leagues, the National Rugby League and Super League.\nWhilst individual international test matches between nations have been staged regularly since 1907, the first world cup of the sport was held in France in 1954, making it the first world cup of either rugby code and the first to be officially known as the \"Rugby World Cup\".\nFull and affiliate members are eligible for the Rugby League World Cup. However, due to the late rescheduling of the 2026 Rugby League World Cup, only full members will be allowed to compete in the next edition.\nAmericas.\nRugby league is a growing sport in the Americas, having first started with All Star exhibition matches in the 1950s. It has been played at an organised semi-professional level in North America since it was first introduced as a competition sport in the 1990s. There are currently domestic leagues operating in Jamaica, Canada and the United States. Many players of Caribbean heritage live and play in the Super League and have brought their skills back to the islands to foster the development of thousands of new players. The game is also played at a lower amateur level across the Americas by ex-patriates although only recognised national organisations are listed here for brevity.\nCanada currently has two domestic competitions, Ontario and British Columbia, with British Columbia being the premier competition with also the most teams. British Columbia Rugby League (BCRL) also has a provincial team known as the BC Bulldogs. In 2012, the BC Bulldogs competed against Utah Avalanche from Salt Lake who currently play in the AMNRL. The game was contested over two legs, home and away, with BC taking both games. The BC Bulldogs also made an appearance at the Las Vegas Remembrance Cup and come third. Coogee Bay Dolphins from Australia took out the competition for the second time in a row.\nIn 2013, BCRL will be made up of 6 teams, namely Bayside Sharks, Kelowna Crows, Richmond Bears, Sea to Sky Eagles, Surrey Beavers and Vancouver Dragons.\nBrazil has also taken up the sport in 2013.\nSince 2013 the Latin Heat Rugby League has had moderate success in introducing rugby League to players with Latin American heritage living in Australia. In 2014 the Latin Heat opened a U.S chapter.\nAsia-Pacific.\nRugby league is a popular sport in Oceania and the Pacific islands. Australia, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea are the main nations playing rugby league in Oceania. \nThe Cook Islands, Tonga, Samoa and Fiji are also RLIF test nations.\nAffiliate nations include Vanuatu, American Samoa, New Caledonia, Niue and Tokelau.\nThe Solomon Islands also have some history of the sport.\nPacific\nAsia\nEurope.\nEurope is the birth place of rugby league with the game originating in Northern England. The sport is played at amateur level in most European countries however it's is only England, Wales, and France that has professional or semi-professional clubs. These three countries were the original members of the Rugby League European Championship.\nThe Great Britain national rugby league team is the most successful side having won three world cups, however since 1995 the team has split in favour of home nations national sides.\nDomestically, the Super League (Great Britain) is the only professional league on the continent however the RFL Championship, RFL League 1, RFL Women's Super League (all Great Britain), and Elite One Championship, and Elite Two Championship (both France) are semi-professional to varying extents.\nMiddle East-Africa.\nRugby league is a growing sport in Africa and the Middle East, with a large growth in players since the 1990s, some of which have played at the game's elite levels in the National Rugby League and Super League. The game in the Middle East is one of the fastest growing sports with regular internationals played against European and Mediterranean teams.\nRugby league is a growing sport in Africa, with the game first introduced to the continent in early 2017. The vast distance of teams from the game's heartlands has at times affected the development of the sport but new advances in the 21st century have seen a major increase in the number of internationals scheduled. Many high calibre players from the continent have progressed to the top club leagues, including Younes Khattabi, Jamal Fakir, Tom van Vollenhoven, Fred Griffiths and Jarrod Saffy. The large ex-patriate Moroccan population in the south of France has resulted in a growing interchange of players between the two countries. Rugby league in Africa is played in South Africa, Gambia, Morocco, Burundi, Nigeria and Ghana."

He was the fourth son of politician Sir David Monro and his wife Dinah. His father would later become the second Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives. His sister, Maria Georgiana Monro, would marry the Scottish geologist, naturalist, and surgeon James Hector.\nMonro attended Nelson College from 1863 to 1865. He became familiar with the sport of rugby at Christ's College in Finchley near London, which he attended from 1867 to 1869, playing in its 2nd XV.\nRugby.\nMonro introduced the game under the 1868 rules of rugby and with the new Gilbert oval ball to the Nelson Football club in 1870. The first game was played between Nelson College \"The Gown\" and Monro's club \"The Town\" at the Botanics ground at 2pm on 14 May 1870.\nFour months later Monro's commitment to establishing rugby in New Zealand was such that he organised, selected, and coached a Wellington team, played for a Nelson team, and refereed the first game in the North Island at Petone on 12 September 1870.\nFamily life.\nMonro's life was unsettled, and he lived in England and on the continent for some time. In 1885, he married Helena Beatrice Macdonald in New Zealand; his wife was known as Lena and was the daughter of Donald MacDonald from Nelson. In 1889, Monro purchased land in Fitzherbert, on the opposite site of the Manawatu River from Palmerston North. He named their house Craiglockhart, and the Monros had five children. Monro was from a long line of doctors, the Munro of Auchinbowie family, and his three sons all became medical professionals.\nHe died in Palmerston North in 1933, and was buried at Kelvin Grove Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and their five children."

        "text": "The United States Short Course National Championships or USA Swimming Winter Nationals is a national championship meet organized by USA Swimming. The competition is swum short course yards (SCY), in a pool 25-yards long. The meet's most recent incarnation began in 2007 and was held annually in November or December until 2018 when it returned to being held in March.\nPrior to 1991, the annual spring U.S. national championships were swum as a 25-yard meet; however, from 1991-2007, the meet was held as a long course (50m) meet. In the mid-2000s, USA Swimming decided to revive a Nationals meet in the short-course-yards format, but decided that the meet should be in December, rather than the late-March/early April time frame that the Spring Nationals had turned into. For 2016 USA Swimming returned to the old format with two short course Nationals in one year, American Short Course Championships in March in Austin and the Winter National Championships in Atlanta in December."

        "text": "The 1986 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was the 57th playing of the midsummer classic between the all-stars of the American League (AL) and National League (NL), the two leagues comprising Major League Baseball. The game was held on July 15, 1986, at the Astrodome in Houston, Texas, the home of the Houston Astros of the National League. The game resulted in the American League defeating the National League 3–2 and ended a streak where the NL won 13 of the last 14 games. Boston Red Sox pitcher Roger Clemens was named the Most Valuable Player.\nRosters.\nPlayers in \"italics\" have since been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame.\nGame.\nWally Joyner was the first rookie to be elected to the starting team of an All-Star squad by the fans and the 15th rookie overall to actually start in a Midsummer Classic but the evening belonged to Roger Clemens. Roger Clemens made his All-Star Game debut and the game was held in his hometown of Houston. With help from Ted Higuera, Charlie Hough, Dave Righetti and Don Aase, Clemens shut down the National League and started his record setting All-Star Game career.\nClemens pitched three perfect innings, had no hits allowed and no walks allowed, which included only three balls and twenty-one strikes, against the formidable National League lineup earning him the All-Star Most Valuable Player Award. The National League pitching staff struck out twelve batters, a total equaled only three times before in All-Star History: 1934 All-Star Game [National League], 1956 All-Star Game [American League] and 1959 All-Star Game [National League].\nIn the second inning, Tigers second baseman Lou Whitaker followed a Dave Winfield double with a homer off Mets pitcher Dwight Gooden. By the fourth inning, Fernando Valenzuela had achieved five consecutive strikeouts. This tied him with the All Star record set during the 1934 All-Star Game by Carl Hubbell. Valenzuela struck out Don Mattingly, Cal Ripken Jr., Jesse Barfield, Lou Whitaker and fellow Mexican Teddy Higuera. In the seventh inning, Frank White pinch-hit for Lou Whitaker and hit an 0–2 pitch from Astros pitcher Mike Scott over the wall. White became the 14th player in the history of the All-Star Game to have a pinch-hit home run. The last player to do so was Lee Mazzilli at the 1979 Major League Baseball All-Star Game.\nThe National League made it interesting in the bottom of the eighth by roughing up Rangers pitcher Charlie Hough for two runs. In the ninth, the National League had runners at first and third with one out when Don Aase got Chris Brown to hit a check-swing grounder for a double play.\nThis was the last All-Star Game to be entirely played indoors until 2011, when it was played at Chase Field in Phoenix.\nCoaching staff.\nThe 1986 All-Star Game turned out to be the final game that Dick Howser (then managing the defending American League and World Champions, the Kansas City Royals) would ever manage. Broadcasters noticed he was messing up signals when he changed pitchers, and Howser later admitted he felt sick before the game. Shortly thereafter, Howser was diagnosed with a brain tumor and underwent surgery. On June 17, 1987, Dick Howser died at the age of 51."

        "text": "The 2002 State of Origin series saw the 21st time that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was played entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. It was the second drawn series in four years and being the second default title retention by Queensland, it ignited protests from the New South Wales camp eventually accepted by the NRL, for the introduction of extra-time to State of Origin matches was introduced to ensure a definitive result.\nGame I.\nA young and enthusiastic New South Wales side proved far too good for their older opponents when they ran away with a 32–4 win in game I. The result suggested a bright future for the Blues who unearthed a number of new stars in fullback Brett Hodgson, centre Jamie Lyon and forwards Luke Bailey, Steve Simpson and Australian Test hooker Danny Buderus. Lyon showed his worth early with a remarkable try in the 24th minute off an Andrew Johns grubber kick on halfway.\nJohns was named man of the match but it was Hodgson who stood tall after many had questioned the ability of the diminutive fullback to withstand the physical demands of Origin. The Parramatta Eels fullback ran for a record 390 metres - more than twice that of any other player on the field - and capped his night with an 80-metre run from the scrumbase to score under the posts.\nGame II.\nQueensland winger, Lote Tuqiri was charged with a dangerous throw in an NRL match and was left off the Queensland team sheet so he could plead guilty at the judiciary, allowing him to serve his ban on the Friday and be available for Game II the following Wednesday.\nIn a typical Origin script, Queensland managed to reverse the result in game II with a thrilling display to level the series. In a disastrous debut, Maroons centre Justin Hodges emulated the feat of New South Wales' Phil Duke of twenty years earlier when he gathered a Johns kick in the 27th minute and fired a pass in goal to Darren Lockyer, only to see the ball sail over Lockyer's head and Blues five-eighth Braith Anasta pounce to give his side the lead. Then in the 61st minute Hodges did it again for Luke Ricketson to score before he was eventually hauled from the field by coach Wayne Bennett as his confidence dropped.\nOn the other side of the field, Queensland centre Chris McKenna was playing the match of his life as he assisted winger Lote Tuqiri to a three-try haul.\nGame III.\nIt was in this match that Gorden Tallis performed a famous tackle on Blues fullback, Brett Hodgson, dragging and eventually tossing him out of the field of play by the collar like a rag-doll. In a dramatic end to one of the most exciting series in years, the Blues thought they'd stolen the game when Jason Moodie finished off a magnificent team movement with three minutes remaining to take an 18–14 lead. But Queensland back-rower Dane Carlaw's try leveled the score at 18-all after a dramatic 50-metre burst, ensuring the title stayed with the Maroons.\nQueensland skipper Gorden Tallis' reaction in giving the one-finger salute to a section of the crowd, right behind the northern tryline where Carlaw's try was scored, became a major after-match talking point. Tallis gained some sympathy when it was revealed that he was objecting to an offensive sign about his mother. But many again raised questions about his capacity to captain Australia with debate raging over the choice between Tallis or Andrew Johns to succeed Brad Fittler. Days later Johns was chosen to lead Australia in the July Test against Great Britain."

        "text": "The 2001 State of Origin series was the 20th year that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. The series was notable for marking the first time an England-based player was selected for State of Origin: Maroons legend Allan Langer was asked to make his comeback for the third and deciding match of the series and did so, helping Queensland re-claim the shield in Brisbane.\nGame I.\nQueensland stalwart coach Wayne Bennett made it a personal mission to regain the great loss of credibility suffered from the 2000 series whitewash and 40 point last game defeat and decided he wanted his old Maroon coaching job back after a two-year sojourn.\nIn game I Queensland blooded no less than ten new players and Wayne Bennett gambled on the likes of Brisbane Broncos forward Carl Webb and North Queensland Cowboys John Buttigieg and John Doyle who were relative unknowns. But they each announced their representative arrival in dramatic style with a try each in the first game, won 34-16 by the Maroons in the last match played at the \"old\" Suncorp Stadium. The most spectacular was Webb's two minutes before half-time when he brushed off three defenders before powering his way across the line.\nGame II.\nQueensland went into game 2 without captain Gorden Tallis who was out with a neck injury.\nPlayed before 70,000 at Telstra Stadium, Blues skipper Brad Fittler scored two tries in what was to be his last match for NSW on home soil and inspired his side to a 26-8 victory. Man of the match was Trent Barrett playing halfback for the first time due to injuries to Brett Kimmorley and Andrew Johns. Debutante Mark O'Meley was particularly impressive, setting up Fittler's first try after 53 minutes with a smashing run that sent defenders skittling.\nGame III.\nThe lead up to Game III was dominated by emotion regarding Brad Fittler's pending retirement from representative football after 29 Origin appearances. But with the series tied at one game apiece Queensland needed some special emotion of their own to avoid a loss. Without inspirational captain Tallis and an established halves pairing, coach Bennett undertook furtive negotiations with Maroon's veteran Allan Langer, then in his second English season and captain of the Warrington Wolves, and the rumours were only confirmed after Langer had boarded a plane (under a false name) for the flight home, bound for his 31st career Origin appearance. At almost 35 years of age, Langer was named in his famous No.7 jersey for the first time since leaving Australia part-way through the 1999 NRL season.\nDespite NSW centre Ryan Girdler scoring the fastest try in Origin history after 39 seconds, Queensland took a 28-8 lead into the break with Langer heavily involved in three of the Maroons' first half tries. Alongside Darren Lockyer who created his own form of havoc, Langer tore New South Wales to shreds and capped his comeback in the 54th minute when he scored a trademark solo try from close range to sentence the Blues to a series-deciding loss and Fittler to his own bittersweet representative farewell (although he would make a comeback three years later and help his state to a victory in his final year before retirement).\nSydney's \"The Daily Telegraph\" reacted to the New South Wales team's Origin loss with this headline on the front of its paper on July 2, 2001: \"BLOODY ALF\"."

        "title": "Shennecossett Golf Course",
        "text": "Shennecossett Golf Course is a municipal golf course located in Groton, Connecticut. The origins of the course go back to 1898 when Thomas Avery, a local resident, established a four-hole course on his farm. Shennecossett changed significantly over the next few decades, including a redesign by Donald Ross, eventually evolving into a full 18-hole country club. In the 1960s, the town of Groton purchased the property, transforming it into a municipal course. In 1997, the town performed a \"land swap\" with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, losing three holes to the corporation but gaining three along the Thames River and Long Island Sound. The acquisition of these new holes has, according to \"Golf Magazine\", \"turn[ed] the perennially solid muni into one of the deals of the century.\"\nHistory.\nThe early days of the course go back to 1898. Thomas Avery, descendent of one of Groton's first settlers, established a four hole course on his property with \"fairways extending on both sides on his barn and farmhouse.\" Over the next few years five more holes were added to create a nine-hole course. The club was constructed on territory once occupied by the Pequot and Mohegan Native American tribes. The word \"Shennecossett\" means \"level land\" in the Pequot language.\nDuring this era, a summer resort, the Griswold Hotel, was built adjacent to the course. During the early 20th century, the owner of the hotel, Morton Plant, was buying much local property, including property from Thomas Avery. Plant ultimately bought his golf course and, over the course of the years 1913 and 1914, added several more holes to create a full 18-hole course. A clubhouse was also constructed during this era and opened to the public on June 9, 1914. On August 10, 1916, the club became the 128th \"active member\" of the USGA. During this era, this property was referred to as \"Shennecossett Country Club.\" Scottish-born pro Alex Smith was the club professional at the time. He \"remained for many years.\" Smith broke the course record with a 69 during this era. \nIn 1926, the well-known golf course architect Donald Ross re-designed the course. Ross's design remained unchanged until the end of the century. During the early 20th century, Shennecossett hosted a number of significant tournaments including the Connecticut Open, a PGA Tour-level event. It also hosted the Connecticut Amateur several times in the 1920s. Club pro Smith was also able to attract some of the world's leading professionals to play exhibition matches at Shennecossett, including J.H. Taylor, Joe Kirkwood Sr., and Walter Hagen. \nIn 1945, the course was sold to Morton Mencher along with the adjacent Griswold Hotel. The name of the course was re-titled the Griswold Hotel and Country Club. Despite this, it was often informally known as \"the Shennecossett\" during this era. Under the new ownership, the course hosted the Connecticut Open, the state's official open, for the only time in its history. The legendary Harry Cooper served as club pro during this era. \nIn the 1960s, the town of Groton attempted to buy the course. In 1964, the town began negotiating with Milton Slosberg, the owner of the course. During this era, the town also applied for financial aid from the federal government to buy the course. The town requested for 50% of the funds to purchase the course. The application was rejected. The town's Recreation Commission still supported the project and supported the town's next application, this one to the state government. The town intended to apply for 50% aid as they had earlier to the federal government that would be worth $507,000. In early 1967, the State of Connecticut's Attorney General Office looked at the application. Despite initial reservations, they ultimately approved the application. On August 25, 1967, the town purchased the course. They placed a $450,000 down payment on the property. The state government would pay the remaining half. \nIn 1997, the club performed a \"land swap\" with the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. The corporation purchased territory consisting of three holes of the course but granted the club a significant amount of its territory. The club created three new holes with the new territory along the Thames River and Long Island Sound. \"Golf Magazine\" praised the addition of these new seaside holes, stating that they helped transform the \"perennially solid muni into one of the deals of the century.\"\nIn 1994, \"The Hartford Courant\" noted that Shennecossett's par-3 4th hole was rated the top par-3 in the state by the state's club pros. In 2004, it was included in \"Golf Magazine\"'s Thrifty 50, one of the top American courses recreational golfers could play for less than $50.\nScorecard.\nIn the early years, during the 1920s, the course measured 6,512 yards from the back tees. Overall, the total yardage has not changed much at Shennecossett over the ensuing century. In the early 21st century, the yardage measured from the back blue tees is 6,562 yards."

        "title": "FreeStyle Street Basketball",
        "text": "FreeStyle Street Basketball (FSSB) is a massively multiplayer online sports game made by JC Entertainment and with cel-shaded graphics. It is a fast-paced, arcade styled representation of half court streetball, self-described as being Hip-Hoop. Players team up with one another to challenge other online players to matches of basketball that are characterized by high tempo, freedom of movement, and a premium placed on synergy and teamwork. Players can also create clubs and enter club matches, play in a single player story mode, roam around in Open Court mode, drop and add skills as needed, and choose from millions of different outfits to express themselves due to the sheer quantity of wearable items in the ingame shop.\nGameplay.\nAll versions of the game offer half court 1 on 1, 2 on 2, and 3 on 3 play with other players online.\n1 on 1 matches are set at 3 minutes, 2 on 2 matches at 4 minutes and 3 on 3 matches at 5 minutes.\nStandard rules of streetball apply, with a shot clock and an overtime mechanism applied: \nThree on three matches are five minutes long, and are unique in the fact that the game starts with a jump ball rather than the home side receiving the ball.\ntwo on two matches are four minutes long, while one on one matches are three minutes long. Both are different from three on three matches in the fact that the home side will always start with the ball.\nEach player can equip their own skills, which are moves that can be activated by pressing the unique inputs needed and \"FreeStyles\", or modifiers of normal moves that all characters have that will either appear at random in the normal move's place, or takes its place in a set order.\nDue to the arcade nature of the game, certain aspects of momentum and physics were ignored to encourage faster pace. As a result, an entirely different metagame rose from exploiting those deficits to pull off and defend against spectacular and illogical moves\nThe game has an experience-based leveling system. When a player reaches a certain experience requirement, they will level up and be rewarded with Attribute points. Attribute points are used to improve the character's skills such as running, jumping, dribbling, stealing and passing.\nDuring character creation, the three main positions are presented. They are the center (C), the Forward (F) and the Guard (G). This classification is from level 1 to 15 with different skills depending on player position. At level 15, Guards and Forwards further specialize their position by selecting between point guard/shooting guard and small forward/power forward, respectively. Upon position choice, the player is then prompted to choose the name, gender, face type, body type and height of their character. Position, gender and height are the only non-cosmetic factors of character creation. After the player's character is successfully created, the player is immediately taken to the game's basic tutorial.\nRecord keeping.\nAs is customary with the sport of basketball, FreeStyle Street Basketball offers an in depth record keeping system.\nThe following statistics are kept by the game when a player completes a 1 on 1 match in their league:\nThe following statistics are kept by the game when a player completes a 2 on 2 or 3 on 3 match in their league:\nMonthly rankings are made for all of these aforementioned stats per league. Career stats are also kept for everything excluding averages and percentages, and as such a career ranking is in place as well.\nThe Man of the Match award is given to the most statistically impactful player on the winning side of a 3 on 3 match. The player with the highest (hidden) MotM points on the winning team receives the reward.\nThere is a special formula for MotM points\nEach point scored = 1\nEach rebound collected = 2\nEach assist made = 3\nEach block converted = 4\nEach steal converted = 5\nWhoever finishes with the greatest number of MVP points wins the award. \nIn the event of a tie, the character that occupies the slot furthest left while in the team wins the award.\nBecause an impressive statline is usually required to win a Man of the Match award, it is popular to use these awards along with the win–loss record of the player to judge an unknown player's quality.\nIn-game economy.\n\"FreeStyle\" uses a micropayment business model in which players can purchase the premium in-game currency varying in name to each server. Another currency, Points, is awarded after games.\nBoth are used to buy skills, freestyles, clothes, and various accessories. Although, there are certain items and skills that can only be bought by the premium currency. Some clothing items have an expiration date, and will disappear after the date.\nReception.\nFreeStyle was rated 6.8 out of 10 by IGN. The enjoyable gameplay and cell-shaded graphics were highlighted. However, criticisms included the lack of initial character customization options, frustrations with joining a game and the \"marketed\" urban style.\nSequels.\nThe sequels of this game are named FreeStyle Street Basketball 2 and FreeStyle 3on3. FreeStyle Street Basketball 2 had its closed beta by publisher Gamekiss from May 14 to May 20 of 2014. The open beta for this sequel began June 20 of 2014 and is currently in progress.\nA Steam version of the game was also released on April 1, 2015.\nThe third installment of this series and direct sequel to FreeStyle Street Basketball 2 is \"3on3 Freestyle\". It was initially released in 2016 by Sony Interactive Entertainment exclusively for PlayStation 4 and build with Unreal Engine 4 game engine. It was later released on Steam on Oct 16, 2017 and published by JoyCity."

        "title": "2000 State of Origin series",
        "text": "The 2000 State of Origin series was the 19th year that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was played entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. During the 2000 series Gorden Tallis was sent off for calling the referee a cheat, Ryan Girdler amassed an incredible 32 points in one match and New South Wales whitewashed the series in a combined scoreline of 104 to 42 - the biggest gap between the two sides in history.\nGame I.\nAfter Ryan Girdler had scored a try to level at 16-all which appeared to have included two knock-ons in the lead up, a furious Gorden Tallis confronted Bill Harrigan and was immediately dismissed after calling him a cheat. Six minutes later the Blues took advantage of the extra man for David Peachey to cross out wide and secure a 20-16 win.\nImmediately after the game Tallis was summonsed to a judiciary hearing at the ground but was not suspended. He had been to the referee's room beforehand and apologised to Harrigan. Blues prop Robbie Kearns later claimed in the Melbourne Herald Sun newspaper that Tallis was to blame for Queensland's loss by showing poor discipline and that he had let himself and his side down.\nGame II.\nNew South Wales' win in the second game secured their first series win since 1997 and the 28-10 scoreline would be their biggest ever winning margin until game III two weeks later.\nGame III.\nNew South Wales centre Ryan Girdler produced the performance of his life and the Blues were hailed as the greatest side in Origin history after they demolished Queensland and completed their third clean sweep. Girdler scored three tries and kicked 10 goals from 10 ten attempts for a record 32-point haul during which New South Wales crossed the Queensland line nine times. New South Wales had led 20-10 at half-time but a try to Andrew Johns after the break saw the floodgates open with six Origin records beaten or matched:\n * Biggest winning margin in State of Origin history (since broken by Queensland in Game III, 2015)\n * Most points in an Origin match\n * Most points by an individual in an Origin match\n * Most points by an individual in an Origin series (Girdler, 52)\n * Most goals by an individual in an Origin match\n * Most tries by an individual in an Origin match (Girdler's three equalled Chris Anderson's in 1983 and Kerry Boustead's in 1984)\nAftermath.\nA major turning point in State of Origin history occurred in this series, when, in the third game, Bryan Fletcher was seen celebrating his try by performing a fake hand grenade aimed towards the Queensland side. The try celebration forced Queensland to change their whole strategy towards Origin and it created a pathway for the Maroons to win fourteen of eighteen series since 2006 (including a record eight straight between 2006 and 2013). Former Queensland player Wendell Sailor said “As a Queenslander, you never forget that\". Queensland Origin great Gorden Tallis had previously spoken about how that try celebration eventually led to a shift in the State of Origin balance of power which saw Queensland win back the Shield in 2001, and retain it in 2002. Former player Matthew Johns claims that the try celebration started a Queensland dynasty. Former Queensland coach Chris Close spoke about Fletcher's try celebration in 2016: \"I thought it was disgraceful act and a disgraceful show of disrespect, You would certainly never, ever see that from any Queensland team, It still burns. F---ing oath it does\"."

        "text": "The 1998 State of Origin series saw the 17th time that the annual three-game series between the Queensland and New South Wales representative rugby league football teams was contested entirely under 'state of origin' selection rules. The return of Super League-aligned stars to Origin following the end of the game's crippling civil war meant the stampeding Brisbane Broncos players were back - to the chagrin of the Blues. The series was notable for being the first in which no team won a game at home.\nGame I.\nGame I was a classic Origin encounter with each side scrambling to gain ascendancy in front of a boisterous Sydney crowd. The Maroons capitalised on mistakes from their opposition to score twice early in the second half before the mercurial Brad Fittler crossed to regain the lead for New South Wales. When Steve Menzies scored close to full-time to give the Blues a 23-18 lead it seemed that they were heading for victory.\nBut with barely a minute remaining and Queensland stuck deep in their own territory, their five-eighth Kevin Walters produced the play of the series as he kicked ahead for replacement back Ben Ikin to regather. The Blues tried desperately to hold on for the few final tackles, but Walters destroyed their hopes by sending centre Tonie Carroll over alongside the posts. Darren Lockyer's conversion on debut after the siren gave Queensland a miracle 24-23 victory. It was a personal triumph for Walters coming only a few months after the death of his wife Kim.\nGame II.\nIn Game II, after falling behind early to a Wendell Sailor try, the Blues took control in the volatile surroundings of Suncorp Stadium. New South Wales centre Paul McGregor, replacing Andrew Ettingshausen in the starting line-up, scored twice and Brad Fittler added a third to give the visitors a commanding 20-6 lead from which the Maroons never recovered.\nAndrew Johns was superb during the Blues' onslaught while Laurie Daley set up the try that levelled the score following Sailor's third-minute opener. A Tim Brasher try shortly after the break ended any hopes of another come-from-behind Queensland win and the final 26-10 scoreline was a fair reflection of the Blues domination over their opposition.\nGame III.\nBefore the Game III return to the Sydney Football Stadium for the decider there was little warning of the problems the New South Wales team were about to encounter when they were flattened by injury and illness. Six players from the selected squad including props Paul Harragon and Rodney Howe and inspirational hooker Geoff Toovey were forced to withdraw prior to the game.\nQueensland emerged full of running, tries to Walters, dummying his way over and then Ikin, giving them a 12-4 lead before Allan Langer wrapped up the series with a late try. A Jason Smith field goal rounded out the impressive Queensland 19-4 win."

        "title": "Shanghai Cricket Club",
        "text": "The Shanghai Cricket Club is a cricket club based in Shanghai, China. The club dates back to 1858 when the first recorded cricket match was played between a team of British naval officers and a Shanghai XI. The original Shanghai Cricket Club ceased activities in 1948.\nFollowing a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949, a new Shanghai Cricket Club (with a different Chinese name) was established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members.\nHistory.\nBefore 1949.\nThe first recorded cricket match in Shanghai was played somewhere in Hongkou on April 22, 1858, between a team of officers from and a Shanghai XI in 1858. Since then cricket has had a home in Shanghai.\nIn 1863, the first true cricket ground was bought by the Shanghai Recreation Fund from the Race Club. The ground was located inside the Shanghai Race Club racecourse, located in present-day People's Square and People's Park on the corner of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road.\nInterport matches with the Hong Kong Cricket Club and the Singapore Cricket Club began in 1866 as a series of home-and-away fixtures which continued up until 1948, just prior to the PLA takeover of Shanghai. It was after the conclusion of one of these series that the Hong Kong team, returning from Shanghai was struck by tragedy as the , the ship that was transporting them back to Hong Kong, sank on October 10, 1892, off the coast of Formosa. Of the 13 Hong Kong cricketers on board, only two survived. The clubs continued to play Interport matches and today, the winner of a series is given the Bokhara Bell Memorial Trophy.\nReincarnation.\nThe Shanghai Cricket Club was reestablished in 1994, under the same English name as the original club but a different Chinese name. In 2004, an inter-club league was established by the four SCC member clubs: Bashers CC, DPR Hot Dogs, Maharajas (now Daredevils) and Pudong CC. The club hosted the Shanghai International Sixes from 1997 through 2009. During this time, a women's side (currently defunct) also existed called the Pearls.\nThe club has two representative teams, the Dragons and the Pirates. Drawn from the best cricket players in the city, the Dragons regularly tour throughout Asia and host international teams in Shanghai. The Dragons have also participated in most of the major tournaments on the Asian Cricket Sixes Tour, winning in Hong Kong, Manila and Phuket. The Pirates were created in 2005 for the Hong Kong Cricket Sixes Festival, and are composed of representatives of all seven member clubs and associate teams in Shanghai. They regularly join the Dragons on tours throughout Asia, focusing heavily on social activities and touring.\nThe Shanghai Cricket Club plays regular matches with the Hong Kong Cricket Club, Kowloon Cricket Club, Lamma Cricket Club, and the Beijing Cricket Club. In addition, the club plays semi-regular fixtures against Centaurs Cricket Club, Singapore Cricket Club, and Kai Tak Cricket Club and has hosted many international touring sides including Marylebone Cricket Club. The Shanghai Cricket Club was also the first club to play organized cricket in North Korea, competing for the Pyongyang Friendship Trophy in 2008.\nThe SCC currently plays at grounds in Waigaoqiao, Pudong, and at Wellington College International.\nSCC League.\nLeague Structure.\nThe Shanghai Cricket Club runs a three division league. The league is made up of the four foundation clubs (Bashers CC, Daredevils CC, DPR Hot Dogs, Pudong CC) as well as four associate teams: K2 CCC, China Zalmi CC, Dulwich Knights and Charminar Cheetahs CC. League matches are played on Sundays from April through September and feature limited overs cricket. Division 1: 40 overs; Division 2: 30 overs; Division 3: 25 overs."

But he struggled outside of the basketball court and at one point as a junior, missed 63 consecutive days of school. \nAs a senior, he was convinced by William Robinson (who had become his legal guardian), to transfer to Spingarn High School, where he had to go through a legal process over his eligibility. \nHe averaged 20 points and 15 rebounds per game, while leading the team to a city championship. He was considered an elite basketball prospect and one of the best players in the nation, but his low grades (2.1 grade average) limited the offers he received from NCAA Division I schools.\nCollege career.\nJones enrolled at Division II University of the District of Columbia, where Robinson was named an assistant coach.

Throughout the next two years, several regional tournaments served as qualification for the zonal tournaments, which doubles as intercontinental championships, to determine which teams will participate in the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics.\nQualification.\nOutright qualification.\nA total of 12 teams will take part in the Olympics, with each NOC sending in one team. The host nation (the People's Republic of China) qualifies automatically as hosts.\nThere are a total of 5 zonal tournaments (doubling as intercontinental championships) that determined the qualifying teams, with a total of 7 teams qualifying outright. Each zone was allocated with the following qualifying berths:\nFurthermore, the current world champion, Spain qualified automatically by winning at the 2006 FIBA World Championship.\nQualification via the wildcard tournament.\nThe additional three teams will be determined at the FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament 2008, with the best non-qualifying teams participating from teams that did not qualify outright. Each zone is allocated with the following berths:\nSummary.\nThese are the final standings of the different Olympic qualifying tournaments. The venues are as follows, with the city of the knockout stage mentioned first:\nFIBA Africa.\nThe FIBA Africa Championship 2007 at Angola determined FIBA Africa's only outright representative to the Olympics and two wildcard participants.\nThe tournament is structured into a preliminary round of 16 teams divided into 4 groups; the top two teams from each group advance to the knockout stages (quarterfinals, semifinals and final).\nAngola won the tournament, beating Cameroon in the final, 86-72. Cape Verde defeated Egypt by 2 points, 53-51 to join Cameroon in the wildcard tournament.\nFIBA Americas.\nThe 2007 FIBA Americas Championship held in the Thomas &amp; Mack Center at Las Vegas, Nevada determined the two teams representing FIBA Americas in the Olympics.\nThe tournament is structured into a preliminary round of ten teams divided into 2 groups; the bottom team from each group is eliminated in the quarterfinals, where results between groupmates carry over. The Top four teams advance to the semifinals. The fifth-best team in the quarterfinals qualifies for the Olympics.\nHosts United States won the tournament, defeating Argentina 118–81 in the final. Puerto Rico and Brazil, the other semifinalists, and Canada the fifth-place team (tied for fourth at the quarterfinals but was beaten by Puerto Rico 72–66 in the last day of the quarterfinals to win the tiebreaker) qualify for the wildcard tournament.\nFIBA Asia.\nWith China automatically qualified, a much weaker team (without Yao Ming and Wang Zhizhi) leaves the race wide open for FIBA Asia's Olympic berth. The tournament held in Tokushima, Japan is structured with a preliminary round of 16 teams divided into four groups, with the top two teams advancing to the quarterfinals, where they'll be divided into two groups. The top two teams in the quarterfinals groups advance to the knockout semifinals and finals.\nChina's early elimination in the preliminary round (their worst performance in the Asian Championships) simplified the implications: only the winner will advance outright to the Olympics. That winner was Iran which defeated Lebanon 74-69 in the final. Korea escaped Kazakhstan 80-76 to join Lebanon in the wildcard tournament.\nFIBA Europe.\nAlthough Spain automatically qualified, they sent in their \"A\" team, considering EuroBasket 2007 was held in their homeland.\nThe tournament was divided into five rounds: the preliminary round where 16 teams are divided into 4 groups, the qualifying round, where bottom team from the prelims are eliminated, while the teams are reassigned into two 6-team groups, with results between teams that played already carried over, then the knockout stages (quarterfinals up to the final) where the top 4 teams in the qualifying round groups advance.\nSpain survived into the final, where they were beaten by Russia, 60–59, which qualified outright to the Olympics. The other outright berth was decided in the third-place game, where Lithuania beat Greece, 78–69. The wildcard qualifiers are Greece, Germany, Croatia and Slovenia, which defeated France in the 7th place game, 88–74, for the last wildcard berth.\nFIBA Oceania.\nWith only Australia and New Zealand participating in the FIBA Oceania Championship 2007, FIBA Oceania's Olympic berth was decided in a best-of-three series played in Australia.\nAustralia won the first two games, rendering the third game inconsequential, which the Tall Blacks won. New Zealand qualified to the wildcard tournament.\nQualified teams.\nAfter the end of wildcard tournament, the twelve teams that qualified for Beijing 2008 are:\nThe italicized teams are the wildcards."

In the 1958–59 season the Punjab cities Lahore, Rawalpindi, Bahawalpur and Multan fielded teams. Owing to Lahore's population and cricketing strength, beginning with the 1961–62 season the Lahore Regional Cricket Association has usually fielded more than one team in first-class tournaments. (Karachi has done the same since the late 1950s.)\nIn 2019, domestic cricket in Pakistan was significantly restructured, with six provincial first-class teams replacing the traditional mix of regional associations and departments, and Lahore being represented by Central Punjab.

        "title": "Arthur Brown (American football)",
        "text": "Arthur Brown Jr. (born June 17, 1990) is a former American football linebacker. He was drafted by the Baltimore Ravens in the second round of the 2013 NFL Draft. He played college football at Kansas State University, where he earned All-American honors. Brown has also played for the Jacksonville Jaguars, New York Jets, and Seattle Seahawks.\nEarly years.\nBrown was born in Wichita, Kansas. He attended Wichita High School East in Wichita, and played high school football for the Wichita East Blue Aces. As a sophomore and junior he was a consensus first-team Class 6A all-state selection and as a junior he was named to the \"Wichita Eagle\" \"Second 11\" all-state team. Brown registered 154 tackles (111 solo) and 7 sacks as a sophomore starter at linebacker in 2005, but also rushed for 462 yards at fullback. As a junior, Brown had 158 tackles, eight sacks and an interception.\nBrown attended the 2006 Oklahoma summer camp where he ran the 40-yard dash in 4.68 seconds. He also had an impressive performance at the 2007 U.S. Army Combine, and announced in June 2007 that he would participate in the 2008 U.S. Army All-American Bowl.\nPete Carroll said that Brown was the best linebacker that he had seen in seven years—referring to D. J. Williams—, while Bob Stoops predicted Brown would win the Dick Butkus Award two times. Primarily because of the Brown brothers, ESPNU nationally televised a matchup between East and Dodge City High School on September 7, 2007. Following the 2007 season, \"USA Today\" recognized him as a high school All-American.\nRecruiting.\nBrown was considered the top prospect to come out of Wichita since Barry Sanders and Kamerion Wimbley. In September 2007, Brown announced that the schools he planned to visit were Alabama, Louisiana State, North Carolina, Miami (FL), and Southern California. Oklahoma, Kansas State, Georgia Tech, Florida, and Georgia, whom he had already visited, were still on his list of ten. Though some predicted Brown would ultimately choose Oklahoma, he eliminated OU along with Alabama, Georgia Tech, and Georgia in early November. On December 5, he eliminated Kansas State from his list. Brown was down to Louisiana State, North Carolina, Miami (FL), Southern California, and Florida, but with no clear front runner, when he held a press conference on December 17 at the Kansas Hall of Fame to announce his decision. He decided to attend the University of Miami.\nCollege career.\nBrown initially attended the University of Miami, and played for the Miami Hurricanes football team. He struggled during his freshman year despite being Miami's top-rated recruit. Hurricanes coach Randy Shannon decided to move Brown from weakside to inside linebacker for his sophomore season, saying he began flourishing in the new role toward the end of the 2008 season. \"The last two weeks of the season he was phenomenal at middle linebacker on scout team. Like Ray Lewis, when he first got here he was outside and he wasn't very good,\" said Shannon.\nBrown left the Miami program in February 2010. Brown, along with his brother Bryce, were named in a report from Yahoo! Sports alleging that student-athletes, coaches and administrators were aware and received impermissible benefits from ex-booster and convicted felon Nevin Shapiro.\nHe subsequently enrolled at Kansas State University in May 2010, and became a member of the Kansas State Wildcats football team. Brown's first season at Kansas State was very productive as he had 95 tackles, 2 sacks and 1 interception. Brown also contributed some key plays during the Wildcats 10-2 season, one such play included getting an interception off Heisman winning quarterback Robert Griffin III to set up game-winning field goal as the Wildcats beat #15 Baylor Bears. He was the first player last season to pick Griffin, ending his streak at 110 passing attempts. Brown also had a 12 tackle game beating the Iowa State Cyclones as Kansas State finished the regular season 10-2. Brown was named Big 12 newcomer of the year, becoming the tenth Wildcat to do so and the fourth in the past five years.\nIn the 2012 season, Brown won the 2012 Big 12 Conference Defensive Player of the Year award, after registering 91 tackles, 2 interceptions (one was returned for a touchdown), six tackles for loss and one sack. He is the third Kansas State player to win the defensive player of the year award as named by the conference, after Mark Simoneau in 1999, and Terence Newman in 2002.\nIn the May 2022, Kansas State announced Arthur Brown would be inducted into the Ring of Honor.\nProfessional career.\nBaltimore Ravens.\nProjected a second-round selection, Brown was ranked as the No. 4 outside linebacker available in the 2013 NFL Draft. He is compared to Daryl Washington, because \"neither linebacker has the ideal size for their position, but they compensate with sideline-to-sideline speed\". In the 2013 NFL Draft, the Baltimore Ravens picked Brown after their star middle linebacker Ray Lewis retired.\nBrown underwent hernia surgery during the off-season a few weeks following the draft. Arthur was placed on injured reserve on January 1, 2015. On September 3, 2016, he was released by the Ravens.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars claimed Brown off waivers on September 4, 2016. He was released by the Jaguars on December 6, 2016.\nNew York Jets.\nBrown was claimed off waivers by the Jets on December 7, 2016. He was released on December 19, 2016.\nSeattle Seahawks.\nOn March 17, 2017, Brown signed with the Seattle Seahawks. He was waived on July 31, 2017.\nSan Antonio Commanders (AAF).\nOn January 4, 2019, Brown signed with the San Antonio Commanders of the AAF.\nOn January 30, 2019, Brown was released by the Commanders as part of the final training camp cuts.\nPersonal life.\nArthur is the son of Arthur Brown, Sr. and Lelonnie Brown. His uncle Lawrence Pete is a former Detroit Lions player, while his younger brother Bryce is a former NFL running back.\nAccording to Jeremy Crabtree of \"Rivals.com\", the Browns were the first brothers ever to both be ranked five-star recruits."

        "text": "Edward Leroy Beard (December 9, 1939 – January 15, 2023) was an American professional football player.\nEarly life and education.\nBeard was born in Chesapeake, Virginia, on December 9, 1939. A 1959 graduate of Oscar F. Smith High School in South Norfolk, Virginia, Beard was an All-American and also State Heavyweight Wrestling Champion in 1957 when his high school, Oscar F. Smith, did not have a wrestling team;\nthe only time this has ever been accomplished by a wrestler. In 1960, Beard completed his post-graduate year at the Staunton Military Academy, where he was a standout football player. Beard played two years of college football at Tennessee before joining the Army, where he was selected Outstanding Player on the Army football team.\nNational Football League.\nDrafted by the San Francisco 49ers in 1964, Beard was a special teams captain and middle linebacker; during his eight years with the team, San Francisco won the NFC West three years in a row. Beard won the Len Eshmont award in 1971 and was the first special teams captain in NFL history. After his career was cut short by injuries, Beard served as linebackers coach for the 49ers and New Orleans Saints, and later became defensive coordinator for the Detroit Lions.\nAfter the NFL.\nIn 1996 the football field at Oscar Smith was renamed Beard-DeLong-Easley Field in honor of Beard and fellow alumni Steve DeLong and Kenny Easley. In 2002 Beard was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame. He was honored along with other former 49ers on November 5, 2006, at an Alumni Day. After leaving football, Beard entered the contracting business and helped promote country music in the greater Hampton Roads area. On October 23, 2011, Beard was riding his bicycle in the north section of Chesapeake, Virginia, and saw a person being beaten by about 15-20 teenagers.

        "text": "James Joseph O'Connell (February 11, 1901 – November 11, 1976) was an outfielder in Major League Baseball.\nBiography.\nO'Connell was born in Sacramento, California. He started his professional baseball career in the Pacific Coast League at the age of 18. Playing for the San Francisco Seals, O'Connell batted over .330 in 1921 and 1922; he was then purchased by the New York Giants for $75,000 ($ in current dollar terms). He served as a backup outfielder for the Giants in 1923 and 1924.\nIn the final series of the 1924 season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. O'Connell offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to throw the games ($ in current dollar terms). Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led to the life-time suspension of O'Connell and Giants coach Cozy Dolan by Commissioner Landis, although future-Hall of Famers Frankie Frisch, George Kelly, and Ross Youngs were also implicated.\nIn 139 games over two seasons, O'Connell posted a .270 batting average (96-for-356) with 66 runs, 8 home runs, 57 RBIs and 45 bases on balls. Defensively, he recorded a .974 fielding percentage."

        "title": "Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf",
        "text": "Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf is a golf video game for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis.\nIt was known as in Japan, bearing the name of Naomichi Ozaki. It is one of the early Sega sports games where a celebrity athlete's name was added to the title when it was localized from Japan (the other two games being \"Tommy Lasorda Baseball\" and \"Pat Riley Basketball\"). Although Arnold Palmer is shown on the box cover and title screen, he is not referenced in the game itself.\nGameplay.\nThe game features two game play modes: tournament and practice. Tournament mode consists of 12 rounds, each with 18 holes of golf. There are three different golf courses, one each in the United States, Japan, and Great Britain (although the background and the scenery does not vary). As the player progresses in the tournament mode, their skill level is increased allowing them to hit the ball farther with greater control. They can also upgrade their golf clubs from the initial black carbon club set, to glass fiber and ceramic clubs. This also increases the distance the player is able to hit the ball. \"Arnold Palmer Tournament Golf\" has no save feature, but instead provides a password after each round of the tournament that allows the player to pick up where they left off.\nIn practice mode, one or two players can play a complete 18 rounds of golf on one of the three courses. Each player can set their skill level and use any of the three golf club sets available in the game.\nBefore each turn, the player's caddy will give advice based on its skill level. At first, the caddy can only give the distance from the ball's current position to the tee. As the game progresses, more skilled caddies can give distances to various landmarks and information about how the ball is lying. The player then selects which club to use during the shot. After this, the player can adjust their golfer's stance in order to put a draw or fade on the ball (all golfers in the game are right-handed).\nTo control the swing, the player uses a power gauge to select the strength and height of the shot. When the player first presses the shot button, a marker starts to upwards to the top of the gauge. If the player hits the shot button again before it reaches the top (this controls how hard the shot will be), the marker will then move back down towards the starting position. The player then must hit the button a third time inside of a green area on the power gauge (this controls how high the shot will go in the air). If the player fails to hit the shot button a third time, the sequence will start over from the beginning.\nWhen the ball reaches the putting green, a close-up of the screen will appear. The game will first show the distance from the ball to the tee, and then show a simple diagram of the lie on the green. The player will then be able to select how hard to hit the ball and in what direction.\nConnections to Sega franchises.\nPressing the start button allows the player to change the music and also whether he hears a cheer from the gallery or not upon completing a hole. Opa-Opa, the player-character from the \"Fantasy Zone\" series, is the cursor in the pause menu. Also, a trick allows the player to play a secret \"Fantasy Zone\" level by hitting the ball 100 times on the first hole of any course without holing out, then entering up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, and A on the game over screen. The special level freezes after a certain number of enemies are killed, but it is impossible to return to the golf game without resetting the system. In addition, Alex Kidd makes appearances in the Tournament Mode after nine holes have been played in each round (called \"Coffee Breaks\")."

        "text": "This article contains information, results and statistics regarding the Australian national cricket team in the 2007–08 season. Statisticians class the 2007–08 season as those matches played on tours that started between September 2007 and April 2008.\nPlayer contracts.\nThe 2007–08 list of contracted players was announced on 1 May 2007. Note that uncontracted players still are available for selection for the national cricket team.\nMatch summary.\n&lt;br&gt;\nTournament Summary\nTwenty20 World Championship.\nAustralia's 2007–08 season began with the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship in South Africa. Australia were placed in Group B and their first official match saw them take on Zimbabwe on 12 September 2007 in Cape Town.\nTo prepare for the tournament, Australia played two warm-up games against New Zealand and South Africa.\nUnofficial Warm-Up: v New Zealand, 8 September, Benoni.\nAustralia were sent in to bowl by New Zealand and early wickets by Ben Hilfenhaus and Brett Lee restricted New Zealand to 4/61 off 9.2 overs. Despite this, a strong partnership of 67 between Ross Taylor and Craig McMillan saw the Kiwis claw their way back. Nathan Bracken claimed the vital wicket of Taylor for 53 and Mitchell Johnson dismissed McMillan for 60 on the last ball of the innings restricting New Zealand to a chaseable 182. Hilfenhaus was the pick of the bowlers for Australia, taking 3/11 off his 3 overs. Nathan Bracken also played a vital role taking 2/34 off his 4 overs.\nAustralia's innings began poorly with Shane Bond taking the wickets of Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden within 4 deliveries. Brad Hodge was dismissed in the second over leaving Australia reeling at 3–15. A very strong partnership between Andrew Symonds and Michael Hussey rescued Australia, as they put on 113 for the fourth wicket. Despite their dismissals, this partnership was enough to see Australia cruise to victory with ten balls to spare. Hussey top scored for Australia scoring 72 off 44 balls, however Symonds was not far behind scoring 70 off 43 balls.\nUnofficial Warm-Up: v South Africa, 9 September, Centurion.\nAustralia were sent in to bat by South Africa and were on the back foot early. In the third over of Australia's innings, Adam Gilchrist and Brad Haddin fell in successive balls to South African pace-bowler Shaun Pollock. Brad Hodge fell in the fourth and Australia were in trouble at 3/21 after 3.4 overs. Just as he did in the warm-up against New Zealand, Andrew Symonds steadied the ship scoring a strong 45 off 26 balls. Despite Symonds' resistance, South Africa continued to steadily take wickets, and only a late flurry of powerful hitting by tailender Mitchell Johnson propelled Australia to a healthy target of 8/179.\nSouth Africa's innings got off to a flying start, and despite Ben Hilfenhaus continuing his good warm-up form by dismissing Herschelle Gibbs in the 6th over for 20, Graeme Smith and AB de Villiers put on a partnership of 116 runs which helped guide South Africa to an easy 8 wicket victory.\nGroup B: v Zimbabwe, 12 September, Cape Town.\nTwenty20 International Debuts: Mitchell Johnson, Brad Hodge\nAustralia got their new season off to a poor start, losing their first official match to Zimbabwe. After winning the toss and electing to bat, Australia were off to a shaky start as some tight and effective Zimbabwean bowling had them at 3/19 off 4 overs. Things never really picked up for the Australian batsmen, who appeared to be suffering from a lack of match practice. In slow conditions Brad Hodge did his best to attempt to steer the innings in the right direction, scoring 35 off 22. However regular wickets falling at the other end meant that Australia were restricted to 138 off their 20 overs.\nBrendan Taylor was the hero for Zimbabwe, as he remained not out on 60 to see the Zimbabweans home to a memorable victory with only one ball remaining. It was a severe wake up call for a quite complacent Australia and in the post-match interview, captain Ricky Ponting explained that Australia have \"got to start respecting [Twenty20] now\".\nGroup B: v England, 14 September, Cape Town.\nAfter their shock loss to Zimbabwe, Australia needed to beat England in order to progress through to the Super 8 stage of the tournament. England won the toss and their captain Paul Collingwood sent Australia in to field. The Australians put in a very disciplined performance with the ball, taking wickets at regular intervals and keeping the run rate low throughout the innings. Nathan Bracken and Mitchell Johnson each took 3 wickets, while Stuart Clark and Brett Lee took 2 and 1 respectively. Several of England's batsmen got starts, however failed to convert them with their top scorer being Andrew Flintoff, reaching 31.\nAustralia cruised to victory on the back of a 79 run opening partnership between Matthew Hayden and Adam Gilchrist. They reached the target within 15 overs and therefore successfully progressed to the Super 8 stage of the tournament.\nAustralia finished first in Group B based upon net run-rate, and were placed in Group F for the Super 8 stage.\nGroup F: v Bangladesh, 16 September, Cape Town.\nAustralia's Super 8's campaign got off to an excellent start as they defeated Bangladesh comfortably in Cape Town. After winning the toss, Australian captain Ricky Ponting elected to field first. Australia bowled excellently, tying down the Bangladeshi batsmen, and only allowing them to score at 6 an over. Brett Lee took the first international Twenty20 hat-trick during this innings and finished with figures of 3/27. Bangladesh's innings never gained momentum and Australia restricted them to 123 off 20 overs.\nAdam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden put on their first Twenty20 century partnership to help the Australians chase down the target of 124 comfortably with over 6 overs to spare.\nGroup F: v Pakistan, 18 September, Johannesburg.\nAustralia's second Super 8's game was not as successful as their first. Sent in to bat, Australia struggled to find any momentum. While many Australian batsmen got starts, tight Pakistan bowling restricted their scoring chances. Michael Hussey top scored for Australia with 37, and at one point a total of 180 plus even looked possible for Australia. Effective bowling at the death however, restricted Australia to 7/164 off their 20 overs. During this innings, Australian captain Ricky Ponting received a hamstring strain and was ruled out of action for between two and four weeks.\nPakistan's top order had struggled throughout the tournament, and this continued in their innings. Stuart Clark took 3 quick wickets to have Pakistan 4/46 after 6.4 overs. Despite this, an excellent 100 run partnership between Pakistan captain Shoaib Malik and Misbah-ul-Haq rescued Pakistan and guided them home with 5 balls to spare. This loss meant that Australia had to win their next Super 8's match against Sri Lanka in order to progress to the semi-finals.\nGroup F: v Sri Lanka, 20 September, Cape Town.\nWith the winner of this match going through to the semi-finals, it was virtually a knockout. Australia won the toss and stand in captain Adam Gilchrist elected to bowl first. This decision was justified as Australia demolished Sri Lanka's top order, having them 7/43 down after 10 overs. While Jehan Mubarak resisted, Sri Lanka were dismissed for a meagre 101 and needed a minor miracle to escape with a victory. Stuart Clark was the pick of the Australian bowlers taking 4/20, the best ever figures by an Australian in Twenty20 Internationals.\nOpeners Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden once again got the Australians off to a magnificent start, and guided them to a very comfortable 10 wicket victory, the first in the Twenty20 World Championship. As a result of this match, Australia finished second in Group F, and therefore qualified for the semi-finals where they would meet India.\nSemi-final: v India, 22 September, Durban.\nThe semi-final stage of the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship saw Australia knocked out by eventual winners India. The Indians won the toss and elected to bat, and after a steady start, an explosive innings by Yuvraj Singh coupled with a quickfire 36 by MS Dhoni saw the Indians reach a strong total of 188 from 20 overs on a batsman friendly Durban pitch. Mitchell Johnson was Australia's best bowler taking 2 wickets in his 4 over spell.\nFacing a difficult task to progress to the final, Australia seemed on target to reach India's total after Matthew Hayden once again top scored for the Australians with 62 off 47 balls. It was in the later overs that Australia's chase was dismantled, as the wicket of Andrew Symonds seemed to give the Indians momentum. Australia managed 173 off their 20 overs, and thus India won by 15 runs and knocked Australia out of the tournament.\nTour of India.\nOn 26 September, Australia arrived in India for a 7-game One Day International series, contesting the Future Cup. The first game of the series was played on 29 September 2007, and the tour concluded with a one off Twenty20 International on 20 October 2007.\nFirst ODI: 29 September, Bangalore.\nSeries was level at 0–0\nSecond ODI: 2 October, Kochi.\nAustralia led the series 1–0\nThird ODI: 5 October, Hyderabad.\nAustralia led the series 2–0\nFourth ODI: 8 October, Chandigarh.\nAustralia led the series 2–1\nFifth ODI: 11 October, Vadodara.\nAustralia led the series 3–1\nSixth ODI: 14 October, Nagpur.\nAustralia led the series 4–1\nSeventh ODI: 17 October, Mumbai.\nAustralia won the series 4–2\nMan of the Series: Andrew Symonds\nSri Lanka in Australia.\nSri Lanka travelled to Australia for a two-match Test series contesting the Warne–Muralitharan Trophy in\nNovember.

Phil Jaques was named as a replacement for the retiring Justin Langer while Brad Hogg and Stuart MacGill were selected in place of the retiring Shane Warne.

Both the Dodgers and the Indians left their longtime Florida homes for new stadiums in the Cactus League in Arizona.\nThe oldest of them all, Progress Energy Park, home of Al Lang Field in St. Petersburg, was retired on March 28 with the Tampa Bay Rays losing to the Cincinnati Reds 6–3. The Rays, unlike the other teams to close stadiums before them, are staying in Florida; they are relocating their spring training home to the Charlotte Sports Park in Port Charlotte, where they spent $20 million to rebuild its main stadium. The site of Progress Energy Park was connected to plans to build a new retractable roof stadium for the Rays to replace the fixed-dome Tropicana Field, but was eventually withdrawn from consideration by team ownership in favor of a more thorough study.\nExhibitions.\nOn March 15 and 16, the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres played a 2-game exhibition series at Wukesong Stadium in Beijing, China, which would later be the baseball venue for the 2008 Summer Olympics. The series marked MLB's first games played in China. The first game ended in a 3–3 tie, and the second ended in a 6–3 win for the Dodgers.\nOn March 29, as part of the 50th anniversary of the Dodgers' relocation from Brooklyn to Los Angeles, the Dodgers hosted an exhibition game against the Boston Red Sox at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, the Dodgers' home stadium from 1958 to 1961. Proceeds from the game were donated to the Dodgers' official charity, ThinkCure. The game saw a sellout crowd of 115,300, which broke the Guinness World Record for the largest crowd to ever attend a baseball game. The previous record was an estimated 114,000 for a baseball demonstration during the 1956 Summer Olympics at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nRegular season.\nOpenings and closings.\nThe Washington Nationals began the domestic portion of the 2008 season in their new US$611 million home, Nationals Park in Washington, D.C., with a nationally telecast ESPN \"Sunday Night Baseball\" game (in a rare one-game series) against the Atlanta Braves on March 30 in the first official baseball game stateside. President Bush threw out the ceremonial first pitch while being booed by some of the crowd that night, and joined Jon Miller and Joe Morgan in the broadcast booth for the third and part of the fourth inning of the game telecast. Fittingly, Ryan Zimmerman hit a walk-off home run to give the Nats a 3–2 win. Nationals Park replaced their temporary home, RFK Stadium. Unlike RFK, Nationals Park has been considered to be fair to both hitters and pitchers. Additionally, there was an exhibition game March 29 against their beltway rivals, the Baltimore Orioles, in which season ticket holders were admitted free. The first game, however, was on March 22, when local university George Washington played a home Atlantic 10 college contest against Saint Joseph's at Nationals Park. The Colonials sent their fans home happy by defeating the Hawks 9–5.\nThis season also marked the last season in New York City for two historic stadiums where the Mets and Yankees reside. Shea Stadium closed in Flushing Meadows, Queens on a down note September 28 with the Mets being eliminated from postseason play for the second consecutive season by the Marlins, 4–2, while Yankee Stadium closed after 83 seasons (the Yankees played at Shea Stadium in 1974 and 1975 while Yankee Stadium was refurbished), with the final home game played on September 21 as the Bronx Bombers defeated the Orioles, 7–3. The teams will move into new ballparks near their current homes – Citi Field for the Mets and New Yankee Stadium for the Yankees – in time for their 2009 home openers on April 13 against the San Diego Padres (Citi Field) and 16th against Cleveland Indians (New Yankee Stadium) respectively. With the closing of these ballparks, Dodger Stadium becomes the largest seating capacity park (56,000) and third oldest baseball stadium (after Fenway Park and Wrigley Field) starting in 2009, and Angel Stadium of Anaheim (built in 1966) and Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum (first baseball game in 1968; stadium was built in 1966) become the fourth and fifth oldest baseball stadiums, respectively.\nNaming rights.\nStarting with the 2008 season, the Cleveland Indians' home field was renamed Progressive Field – after the insurance company based in suburban Mayfield Heights – in a deal valued at US$57.6 million over the next sixteen seasons. The new name replaces Jacobs Field, named for former team owner Richard Jacobs.\nAnother naming rights agreement concerned a stadium still under construction. The Minnesota Twins and Minneapolis-based retail giant Target Corporation announced on September 15 that the Twins' new stadium set to open in 2010 will be named Target Field. Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed. Target Field is located not far from another facility of which the discount retailer owns naming rights: Target Center the home of the NBA's Timberwolves.\nOn September 19, the naming rights contract owned by McAfee for Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum lapsed; McAfee declined a new contract offer. The Coliseum, home to the Oakland Athletics since their 1968 relocation from Kansas City, reverted to its old name after 10 years, during which it was originally known as Network Associates Coliseum, then McAfee Coliseum when the company changed its name in 2004. The A's played their last home series after the stadium reverted its name.\nOther.\nAs a consequence of Hurricane Ike damaging the Houston area, two games between the Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs were relocated to Miller Park in Milwaukee. Although Milwaukee was picked as a \"neutral\" site whose retractable roof would ensure the game would be played in the event of inclement weather, Miller Park's location from Chicago – and well over from Houston – resulted in a decidedly pro-Cubs crowd in a series where Houston was officially designated as the home team. Adding to the controversy from the Houston perspective was the fact that Turner Field in Atlanta had been suggested by the players' union as a potential neutral site. This would mark the second time in as many years that a series was moved to neutral Miller Park due to weather, as a series between the Seattle Mariners and Cleveland Indians was relocated there one year earlier as a consequence of snow storms in northern Ohio.\nInstant Replay.\nDuring last season, especially the ALCS, several plays were deemed to be considered controversial on whether or not balls were ruled home runs. During a game in the annual interleague Subway Series between the Mets and the Yankees at Yankee Stadium, a home run was taken away and ruled a ground rule double. This led to discussions about introducing instant replay to baseball games, especially on balls that are ruled fair or foul and home runs. In August, all 30 parks have been wired to send feeds similar to a video goal judge in the NHL, where all video feeds are sent to a central control room at Major League Baseball Advanced Media's home office in New York City to be reviewed, and correct any errors. On August 20, MLB and the World Umpires Association, the umpires union, agreed to start reviews based only on whether or not a ball that is ruled a home run was fair or foul, or whether or not balls that clear walls are home runs according to each team's ground rules. This practice started August 28.\nThe first official use of the Instant Replay system occurred on Wednesday, September 3 in a game between the New York Yankees and Tampa Bay Rays at Tropicana Field, when Alex Rodriguez hit a home run in the top of the ninth inning with two outs remaining. Tampa Bay catcher Dioner Navarro and manager Joe Maddon initially protested in order to reverse the call as it appeared to be foul. Television replays showed the ball hit Tropicana Field's D-Ring catwalk on the foul side of the attached yellow post; however, the ball was still in fair territory when it left the playing field (passing over the foul pole) and was therefore a home run. Umpire crew chief Charlie Reliford agreed to the review and after a delay of 2 minutes and 15 seconds, the ruling on the field was upheld and remained a home run.\nReplay made its National League debut on September 9 at Minute Maid Park in a game between the Houston Astros and Pittsburgh Pirates. Houston right fielder Hunter Pence hit a fly ball to right field that bounced off the top of the fence and back onto the field of play. The umpires on the field ruled a live ball, and Pence was credited with a double. Houston manager Cecil Cooper argued the ball bounced beyond the fence before bouncing back onto the field and was therefore a home run. After a discussion among the umpires, crew chief Tim Welke allowed the review and reviewed the play with his brother Bill Welke, the home plate umpire. After the review the call was upheld as a double.\nThe first call to be reversed by instant replay occurred on September 19, and again involved the Tampa Bay Rays in a game against the Minnesota Twins at Tropicana Field. A fly ball hit by Rays' first baseman Carlos Peña, the umpires ruled, was interfered with by a fan sitting in the front row of the stands, when the ball hit the hands of the fan and fell back onto the field of play. The umpires originally ruled that the fan reached over the wall to touch the ball. After Rays manager Joe Maddon requested the umpires hold a conference to discuss the play, the umpires, headed by Gerry Davis, decided to look at instant replay. Replays showed that the fan did not reach over the wall; the ball was over the wall when he tried to catch the ball, and the ball bounced back onto the field. Just over four minutes later, Davis returned to the field and signaled that the ball was a home run.\nThe use of replay created a statistical anomaly September 26, in which San Francisco Giants catcher Bengie Molina hit what was ruled a single off the high wall in right field at AT&amp;T Park in San Francisco, in a game against the Los Angeles Dodgers. Once he reached base, Molina was replaced by pinch runner Emmanuel Burriss, while Umpires conferred on whether the ball had actually hit the roof and bounced back, which would make it a home run. After a replay review, the umpires reversed their call, awarding Molina the home run. Giants manager Bruce Bochy then attempted to retract Burriss from the game, and put back Molina, under the logic that he wouldn't have pulled Molina had the correct call of home run been made in the first place. After a 15-minute delay, the umpires denied Bochy, citing the replacement rule. Burriss was told to complete the home run circuit, making it a two-run home run in which Molina, who had hit it, didn't score.\nMedia coverage.\nUnited States.\nFor the 2008 season, TBS switched from doing Atlanta Braves games (who telecast 45 contests on WPCH-TV a/k/a \"Peachtree TV\" locally in Atlanta) to a national Sunday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" format (though some games have involved the Braves). In addition, the Time Warner-owned cable channel also carried the one-game AL Central playoff between the Minnesota Twins and the Chicago White Sox on September 30 as well as the entire League Division Series and the American League Championship Series this season, with TNT possibly carrying some games when there are time conflicts.\nDisney-owned ESPN continued to televise games on Sunday nights, Wednesday nights, and (through the first week in August) Monday nights, switching to Friday nights for the remainder of the season, plus multiple afternoon and prime-time games on the traditional Opening Day (March 31) and the annual State Farm Home Run Derby on July 14. Certain games aired on ESPN2 due to scheduling conflicts with the parent network.\nFOX Sports continued with a weekly regional Saturday \"Game of the Week\", the All-Star Game, the National League Championship Series, and the World Series. The \"Game of the Week\" was expanded in 2007, as for the first time FOX was allowed to air Saturday games for all 26 weeks of the season, marking the first time since 1989, when NBC ended their iconic run of televising America's Pastime on a weekly basis, that a network covered games on a week to week basis for the entire season. Also, all games on FOX were televised in high definition; in previous years, only the primary (or \"A\") game was in HD.\nThe limits for telecasts per season (starting in 2008) that any team can make are as follows:\nESPN Radio continued as the national radio carrier for Major League Baseball, airing Sunday night games throughout the regular season as well as Saturday afternoon games after the All-Star break, the All-Star Game and Home Run Derby, along with selected Opening Day and holiday games, and the entire postseason.\nThe biggest change in local rights came as the San Francisco Giants switched their terrestrial telecast rights from longtime home KTVU (Cox Communications-owned Fox affiliate) to NBC Universal-owned KNTV after fifty years, one of the longest in televised sports history. KTVU will continue to air some Giants games as part of the Fox Sports' Saturday afternoon \"Game of the Week\" package if the team is competitive.\nCanada.\nBaseball games – mostly involving the Toronto Blue Jays – were televised on Rogers Sportsnet, TSN, and CBC. RSN airs Fox and ESPN/ESPN 2 feeds if they do not conflict with the Toronto Blue Jays games, as well as the All-Star Game and the entire post-season.\nApparel.\nMilitary tributes.\nSeveral teams wore special uniforms to honor military serving overseas:\nWeather.\nThrough the 2008 All-Star break, there had not been an official game called that was not suspendable. As of the break, every win and loss in the standings for every team represented a game played to its legitimate nine-inning (or more) completion. The streak ended on August 4 in Chicago, however, when the Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros were unable to complete their game due to a rainstorm. The Astros were leading the game 2–0 in the 8th inning, and since that was the score when the inning started, the game was not resumeable to the next day and the Astros were awarded the \"win\". This was the only game to be rain shortened until September 26, when the Toronto Blue Jays defeated the Baltimore Orioles in a game curtailed to seven innings, 2–0. The next day, the Jays lost another rain-shortened game against the O's, 2–1 after 6 innings.\nBoth the Astros and the Cubs were also involved in a rare \"rain-in\" due to Hurricane Ike postponing the first two games of their three-game series on September 12 and 13; the city of Houston had been evacuated so they were not able to play at the retractable-roof Minute Maid Park. The last rain-in was on June 15, 1976, when the Astros' game at the Astrodome against the Pittsburgh Pirates was called due to heavy flooding in the Houston area. Two of the games were played at Miller Park in Milwaukee on September 14 and 15, the remaining game was canceled outright, one of three games that would be outright canceled, the first being the Oakland Athletics scheduled to play the Orioles on September 7; however, the game was switched due to a conflict with the Baltimore Ravens' NFL season opener against the Cincinnati Bengals. This game was moved to September 6 as part of a day/night doubleheader. However, the remnants of Hurricane Hanna called off the afternoon game, and because both teams were not in the pennant races, the game was not made up, in spite of the fact that both teams still had two common off days.\nIn another weather-related note involving a team playing in an indoor venue, the Tampa Bay Devil Rays/Tampa Bay Rays had either postponed or canceled a home game on a Sunday in September of a presidential election year three consecutive times due to hurricanes. The streak started on September 17, 2000, and continued on September 5 and 26, 2004. The streak ended when the Rays played their game against the Minnesota Twins as scheduled on September 21, 2008. They played at home on the final day of the 2000 season, but that game was on October 1, not September.\nThe 2008 season also marked the first time Citizens Bank Park, home of the Philadelphia Phillies and Busch Stadium, home to the St. Louis Cardinals made it through an entire season without a game either being canceled or shortened. The Washington Nationals came close, but their home finale at Nationals Park was canceled on September 25.\nOn September 29, one day after the scheduled final day of the season, the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox made up a game postponed from two weeks earlier, the first such game since 1981, as in 1908 and 1973. The game needed to be played because the White Sox trailed the Minnesota Twins by a half-game in the AL Central standings following play on September 28, and even then, rain was a problem as the contest was delayed for three hours and four minutes.\nOn October 27, Game 5 of the World Series between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Philadelphia Phillies was suspended in the bottom of the 6th with the score tied 2–2 and the Phillies leading 3–1 in games. This marked the first time in World Series history that a game was suspended. The game finished with the Phillies winning 4–3, at home on October 29. However, the official records will indicate that the game was played on October 27, the game's original date."

Hill served as general manager of the Marlins from 2007 to 2013.\nEarly life and career.\nHill was born to an African-American father and a Cuban mother. His maternal grandfather worked for Procter &amp; Gamble in Havana and was sponsored to relocate to the company's Cincinnati headquarters. Hill has stated he was \"pretty much raised African-American\" as his family wished to acclimate to American culture upon immigrating. Hill originally attended Withrow High School where he played on their football team before being offered the opportunity to attend Cincinnati Country Day School. He played football, baseball, and basketball at Cincinnati Country Day School during his senior year.\nA 1993 graduate of Harvard University, Hill was elected senior class marshal while starring as the Crimson football team's top rusher and the baseball team's captain. Following Harvard, he was drafted in 1993 by the Texas Rangers in the 31st round. He made his Minor League debut in 1993 with Class A Short-Season Erie and remained with the club when it relocated to Hudson Valley in 1994. He played two seasons in the Rangers system and one year in the Reds organization before joining the Tampa Bay Devil Rays front office in 1995.\nMajor League Baseball.\nIn 1999, Baseball America named Hill as one of 10 people in baseball whose prominence will increase significantly in the first decade of the new century. It quoted strong sources who said he would turn into a successful general manager before the 2010 season. That year, he began working for the Colorado Rockies, serving as their director of player development until leaving to join the Florida (now Miami) Marlins' front office.\nHill has been a part of the Marlins organization for over a decade, having joined their front office in 2002. At the age of 32, Hill was named to the \"Hot List\" by the Black Enterprise magazine in their December 2003 issue, a list that represents the best and brightest African American executives under the age of 40.\nOver time, Hill has served positions such as VP, assistant general manager, and general manager. Hill worked closely in the past with former president of baseball operations Larry Beinfest, focusing on roster management, payroll and contract research and negotiation, and waiver and rule compliance.\nHill signed an extension through the 2015 season on September 29, 2007, and was promoted to president of baseball operations of the Miami Marlins in September 2013. In 2021, Hill was named a co-Senior Vice President of On-Field Operations for MLB.\nPersonal life.\nHill has 3 sons. In January, 2008, Hill completed his first marathon, finishing the Miami Marathon. He continued to compete in marathons and averaged 50 miles a week while training for the World Marathon Challenge."

Between 2019-20 and 2022–23, the city of Karachi was represented in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy by the Sindh cricket team.\nTeams.\nOwing to the strength of cricket in Karachi, from the 1956–57 season the Karachi City Cricket Association has usually fielded two, sometimes three, first-class teams.

In the 1956–57 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy the teams were Karachi Whites (who lost the final), Karachi Blues (defeated by Karachi Whites in a semi-final) and Karachi Greens. In 2014–15 the two latest team names made their debuts: Karachi Dolphins (in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy Gold League) and Karachi Zebras (in the Silver League).\nIn 2019, domestic cricket in Pakistan was significantly restructured, with six provincial first-class teams replacing the traditional mix of regional associations and departments, and Karachi being represented by Sindh. In 2023, this structure was abandoned, with Karachi Whites returning to first-class competition, competing in the 2023–24 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy.\nIn order of appearance, the teams have been:\nKarachi&lt;br&gt;\n1953–54 to 2003–04, 123 matches in 26 seasons; 43 wins, 39 losses, 41 draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 499 by Hanif Mohammad in 1958–59, which remained the world first-class record score until 1994, and the best bowling figures were 8 for 83 by Tanvir Ali in 1984–85.\nKarachi's record includes six matches against international touring teams.\nKarachi Greens&lt;br&gt;\n1956–57 to 1983–84, 16 matches in seven seasons; seven wins, four losses, five draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 111 not out by Kamal Najamuddin in 1983–84, and the best bowling figures were 8 for 75 by Aslam Qureshi in 1971–72.\nKarachi Whites&lt;br&gt;\n1956–57 to 2013–14, 271 matches in 40 seasons; 119 wins, 58 losses, 94 draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 324 by Waheed Mirza in 1976–77, and the best bowling figures were 10 for 58 by Shahid Mahmood in 1969–70.\nKarachi Blues&lt;br&gt;\n1956–57 to 2013–14, 279 matches in 40 seasons; 114 wins, 75 losses, 90 draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 303 not out by Mushtaq Mohammad in 1967–68, and the best bowling figures were 8 for 39 by Rashid Khan in 1983–84.\nKarachi A&lt;br&gt;\n1957–58 to 1979–80, 13 matches in five seasons; seven wins, two losses, four draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 146 not out by Hanif Mohammad in 1957–58, when Karachi A won by an innings without losing a wicket, and the best bowling figures were 6 for 23 by Mohammad Munaf in 1957–58.\nKarachi B&lt;br&gt;\n1957–58 to 1978–79, 14 matches in four seasons; seven wins, two losses, five draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 158 by Naushad Ali in 1962–63, and the best bowling figures were 8 for 39 by Mohiuddin Khan in 1978–79.\nKarachi C&lt;br&gt;\n1957–58, five matches; three wins, one loss, one draw.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 137 by Salimuddin in 1957–58, and the best bowling figures were 6 for 14 by Mahboob Shah in the same match.\nKarachi Urban&lt;br&gt;\n2005–06 to 2007–08, 14 matches in three seasons; six wins, four losses, four draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 200 by Khurram Manzoor in the one-off match against Mumbai in 2007–08 (Karachi Urban's last match) and the best bowling figures were 6 for 93 by Nasir Khan in 2005–06.\nKarachi Harbour&lt;br&gt;\n2005–06 to 2006–07, 16 matches in two seasons; six wins, eight losses, two draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score was 200 not out by Moin Khan in 2005–06, and the best bowling figures were 6 for 54 by Anwar Ali in 2006–07.\nKarachi Dolphins&lt;br&gt;\n2014–15, 11 matches in one season; four wins, four losses, three draws.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score is 207 by Fazal Subhan in 2014–15, and the best bowling figures are 8 for 122 by Shahzaib Ahmed in 2014–15.\nKarachi Zebras&lt;br&gt;\n2014–15, six matches in one season; two wins, three losses, one draw.&lt;br&gt;\nThe highest score is 114 by two batsmen in 2014–15, and the best bowling figures are 7 for 16 by Mansoor Ahmed in 2014–15.\nNote: The Karachi Port Trust team is listed separately, as it was sponsored by a corporation, not by the Karachi City Cricket Association.\nHonours.\nQuaid-i-Azam Trophy.\nKarachi teams have won the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy a record 18 times.\nPatron's Trophy.\nKarachi teams have won the Patron's Trophy 11 times\nNational T20 Cup.\nKarachi teams have finished as runner-up in the National T20 Cup on 6 occasions, as the Karachi Dolphins."

For example, Keeler's (1, 44) indicates 1 hit in 1896, and 44 in 1897.\nThis list omits Denny Lyons of the 1887 American Association Philadelphia Athletics, who had a 52-game hitting streak. In 1887, the major leagues adopted a new rule which counted walks as hits, a rule which was dropped after that season. Lyons hit in 52 consecutive games that season, but his streak included two games (#22 and #44) in which his only \"hits\" were walks. In , MLB ruled that walks in 1887 would not be counted as hits, so Lyons' streak was no longer recognized, though it still appears on some lists. In 2000, Major League Baseball reversed its 1968 decision, ruling that the statistics which were recognized in each year's official records should stand, even in cases where they were later proven incorrect. Paradoxically, the ruling affects only hit \"totals\" for the year; the batting champion for the year is not recognized as the all-time leader despite having the highest single-season average under the ruling, and Lyons' hitting streak is not recognized.\n6 hits in a game by an individual, twice.\nExcluded on this list are Henry Larkin, who accomplished this with the Washington Senators in the American Association, and Ed Delahanty, with the Philadelphia Phillies in the Players' League."

Arnold Palmer birdied the final two holes to win by one stroke over runner-up Ken Venturi.\nIt was the second of Palmer's four Masters victories and the second of his seven major titles. Palmer, age 30, also won the U.S. Open in 1960 and was the runner-up at the British Open.\nJack Nicklaus, age 20 and the reigning U.S. Amateur champion, played in his second Masters. He made the cut for the first time at Augusta and tied for 13th place. Defending champion Art Wall Jr. did not play, due to a knee injury. The purse was $87,050 with a winner's share of $17,500.\nThird place finisher Dow Finsterwald received a two-stroke penalty after the second round for violating a local rule, practice putting on the green following the conclusion of a hole, and lost the title by two strokes. The incident had occurred in the first round, and was self-reported after the second round after he was informed by his playing partner Billy Casper that it was not allowed. Instead of leading at 139 (−5), Finsterwald was tied with Ben Hogan and two others for second place after two rounds at 141, one stroke behind leader Palmer at 140.\nPalmer was the sole leader after all four rounds and was the second wire-to-wire winner at the Masters, following Craig Wood in 1941. Subsequent wire-to-wire winners were Jack Nicklaus in 1972, Raymond Floyd in 1976, and Jordan Spieth in 2015.\nThe 36-hole cut rule was slightly modified this year to include all golfers in the top 40 plus ties or within 10 strokes of the lead.

He was arrested and released after posting bond. After a brief internal investigation, the Colts cut Johnson from the team less than 24 hours later.\nOn May 5, 2009, Johnson was re-signed by the Colts, with new head coach Jim Caldwell saying that they would give him a second chance, hoping that he learned from his mistakes.\nOn October 13, 2009, Johnson was waived by the Colts for the second time.

        "text": "The 1961 Masters Tournament was the 25th Masters Tournament, held April 6–10 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nDue to heavy rains and flooding of several greens, Sunday's final round was halted before 4 p.m. and the scores were erased, even though ten players had completed their rounds. Third round leader Gary Player was even par through eleven holes, and defending champion Arnold Palmer was two-under through nine. The entire round was replayed the next day.\nIn the final round on Monday, Player defeated Palmer and amateur Charles Coe by one stroke to become the first international champion at the Masters. Player made an up and down from the bunker on the final hole but thought he had lost the tournament, after carding a disappointing 40 (+4) on the back nine. In the final pairing with a one-shot lead, Palmer needed a par on the final hole for the win. From the fairway, his approach shot also landed in the bunker right of the green. With a poor lie, Palmer's bunker shot went past the hole and off the green and down a hillock. Using his putter from off the green, he failed to get the fourth shot close, then missed the bogey putt which would have forced a playoff.\nIt was the first of three green jackets for Player, age 25, and the second of his nine major titles. His other wins at Augusta came over a decade later in 1974 and 1978. Jack Nicklaus, 21, recorded the first of his 22 top-10 finishes at the Masters, his last as an amateur. He tied for seventh, but the low amateur honors went to Coe. Nicklaus regained the U.S. Amateur title in September at Pebble Beach and turned professional in November.\nA field of 88 players entered the tournament and 41 of them made the cut at five-over-par (149).\nAmateur Deane Beman won the Par 3 contest with a score of 22; he turned pro in 1967 and later became the second commissioner of the PGA Tour, from 1974 to 1994.\nField.\nJack Burke Jr. (4,8,11), Jimmy Demaret, Doug Ford (4,10,11), Claude Harmon (8), Ben Hogan (2,3,4,8,9), Herman Keiser, Cary Middlecoff (2,11), Byron Nelson (2,4), Arnold Palmer (2,8,9,10), Gene Sarazen (2,3,4), Horton Smith, Sam Snead (3,4,8,10,11), Craig Wood (2)\nTommy Bolt (8), Julius Boros (8,9,11), Billy Burke, Billy Casper (8,9), Jack Fleck (9), Ed Furgol, Tony Manero, Lloyd Mangrum, Dick Mayer, Fred McLeod, Sam Parks Jr., Lew Worsham\nJock Hutchison (4), Denny Shute (4)\nWalter Burkemo, Dow Finsterwald (8,9,11), Vic Ghezzi, Chick Harbert, Chandler Harper, Jay Hebert (10,11), Lionel Hebert (8), Johnny Revolta, Bob Rosburg (8,11), Jim Turnesa\nDeane Beman (6,7,a), Dick Chapman (a), Charles Coe (6,a), Jack Nicklaus (6,8,9,a), Robert Sweeny Jr. (a)\nWilliam C.

        "text": "The 1968 Masters Tournament was the 32nd Masters Tournament, held April 11–14 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nBob Goalby won his only major championship, one stroke ahead of Roberto De Vicenzo, the reigning British Open champion. On the back nine in the final round, Goalby birdied 13 and 14 and eagled 15 to record a 66 (−6) and a total of 277 (−11).\nAt first it appeared that he had tied De Vicenzo and the two would meet in an 18-hole Monday playoff, but De Vicenzo returned an incorrect scorecard showing a par 4 on the 17th hole, instead of a birdie 3, sunk with a two-foot putt. Playing partner Tommy Aaron incorrectly marked the 4 and De Vicenzo failed to catch the mistake and signed the scorecard. USGA rules stated that the higher written score signed by a golfer on his card must stand, and the error gave Goalby the championship.\nSpeaking to the press after the error, De Vincenzo said, \"What a stupid I am.\"\nIronically, Goalby discovered a scoring error he had made on the card he was keeping for Raymond Floyd, his playing partner in the final round, which he corrected at the scorer's tent. He had marked Floyd down for a par-3 on the 16th hole, when Floyd had actually bogeyed the hole. Floyd ended up in a tie for seventh place with, among others, Aaron. Both Aaron and Floyd would win the Masters in future years, Aaron in 1973 and Floyd in 1976.\nJack Nicklaus tied for fifth place and third-round leader Gary Player finished tied for seventh. Lee Trevino, 28, made his Masters debut and was two strokes back after three rounds, tied for seventh place. A rough back nine of 43 (+7) pushed his score to 80 and he finished tied for 40th. Two months later, he won the 1968 U.S. Open, the first of his six major titles. The Masters was the only major that eluded him; his best finish was a tie for tenth, in 1975 and 1985. Citing incompatibility, Trevino skipped Augusta three times in the early 1970s, and missed in 1977 due to a bad back.\nIn his fourteenth Masters at age 38, four-time champion Arnold Palmer found the water three times during a second round 79 for 151 and missed the cut for the first time at Augusta. He made the next seven cuts, through 1975.\nBob Rosburg won the ninth Par 3 contest on Wednesday with a score of 22.

England made two trips to Sri Lanka in this tour with the ODI team arriving on 25 September before returning to England on 15 October. The Test team arrived on 15 November and stayed there for the remainder of the tour. The tour included three Test matches and five ODIs.\nSri Lankan cricket team.\nSri Lanka entered the series ranked fourth at both ODI and Test levels. The team had good recent performances in ODI reaching the final of 2007 Cricket World Cup and beat Bangladesh 3–0. Their recent record against England was good winning seven of the last ten ODI matches which included a whitewash series of 5–0 in 2006. With the injury to Andrew Flintoff captain Mahela Jayawardene wished to exploit his absence saying his presence adds balance to the team.\nEnglish cricket team.\nEngland ranked seventh in the ODI rankings had had mixed performances winning the 2006–07 Commonwealth Bank Series and the recent ODI series against India but lost to the West Indies and performed poorly in the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The team had a new look with new captain Paul Collingwood going on his first away tour while James Anderson and Stuart Broad formed a new front line attack. Other relative newcomers to the squad were all-rounders Dimitri Mascarenhas and Ravi Bopara. England had still not resolved their keeping problem with Matt Prior not being offered a central contract and had selected five wicketkeepers in the past 12 months; Chris Read, Geraint Jones, Paul Nixon, Prior and Phil Mustard.\nUnlike the ODI team the Test team was ranked higher than Sri Lanka but with England playing away the series was expected to be a close affair. Their recent Test performances had been disappointing however, suffering a whitewash in the last Ashes tour and losing their first home series in six years to India.\nSquads.\nMuttiah Muralitharan missed the ODI series due to a biceps injury and Kaushal Lokuarachchi was called up as a replacement.\nMatt Prior was originally included in England's ODI squad but was withdrawn from the squad after breaking his thumb in a training session prior to the New Zealand game in the 2007 ICC World Twenty20. Phil Mustard was selected as his replacement which was his first England call-up while Graeme Swann gained his first England call-up in seven years. On 20 September Andrew Flintoff pulled out of the ODI series after suffering a recurrence of an ankle injury and was replaced by Chris Tremlett. Flintoff was ruled out of the Test series so he could undergo further keyhole ankle surgery .\nFor Sri Lanka, Sanath Jayasuriya announced his retirement from Test cricket on Day 3 of the first Test, effective at the end of that Test. Tillakaratne Dilshan and Chanaka Welegedara joined the squad for the third Test. Dilshan replaced the ineffective Jehan Mubarak. Welegedara earned his first Test cap as a substitute for Dilhara Fernando, who was forced to undergo ankle surgery for an injury suffered during Sri Lanka's 2007 tour to Australia that clearly affected him during the first two Tests.\nTour match.\nPaul Collingwood, Stuart Broad, Luke Wright, Alastair Cook and Kevin Pietersen all recovered from a stomach virus to start the match. Due to special regulations both teams consisted of 14 players with 11 of these players fielding/batting. England won the toss and chose to bat first and initially scored slowly with Mustard taking 15 balls to get off the mark. Cook and Bell established a strong partnership of 89 before Pietersen scored 50 from only 29 deliveries. Quick runs from Bopara and then Shah insured England set a good target of 314/4 with Bell scoring an unbeaten 131.\nSri Lanka suffered two early setbacks but made a minor recovery with Chamara Kapugedera and Indika de Saram putting on 65 for the third wicket. Wickets then fell at regular intervals and when Kapugedera was caught off the bowling of James Anderson the game was effectively over. Ashan Priyanjan and Malinga Bandara provided some resistance but England still managed to gain a comfortable 80 run victory.\nODI series.\n1st ODI.\nGraeme Swann was picked ahead of Monty Panesar as England decided not to field with a second spinner. The conditions on the day were windy with little swing in the wicket. The pitch was recently re-laid resulting in little pace and variable bounce which was to trouble both teams in the match. Paul Collingwood commented that the wicket was like an English wicket.\nSri Lanka won the toss and chose to bat and started well with Upul Tharanga and Sanath Jayasuriya adding 77 for the opening wicket. After 30 overs Sri Lanka were in a strong position of 150/2 and were looking to set a large total but when Swann got Kumar Sangakkara stumped the rate slowed. This was Swann's first ODI wicket and Phil Mustard's first stumping for England. Sri Lanka could not accelerate in the final overs, losing four wickets in quick succession but still managed to finish on a good total of 269/7. Numerous interruptions in the match meant that Sri Lanka's first innings went over the allocated time as there were problems with the sightscreens, bails falling off and even a dog running across the outfield.\nAs a result of a prolonged innings the break was reduced to 30 minutes. A dropt catch at second slip allowed Mustard to get of the mark, this would be a sign of things to come as England collapsed from 43/0 to 106/6 losing Mustard, Bell, Pietersen and Collingwood within 15 runs. A stand of 42 between Swann and Ravi Bopara delayed the end but England still lost by 119 runs their biggest defeat to Sri Lanka in terms of runs.\nFarveez Maharoof was awarded man of the match with bowling figures of 4/31 and was compared to Glenn McGrath with his bowling performance on the day. The winning captain Jawardere said patience with the bat was the key to setting a good score of 270 stating that if he aimed for 300 he would have risked being bowled out on less than 250. Collingwood was disappointed with England's batting effort and admitted that Sri Lanka's bowling was at a level that his team wanted to achieve.\n2nd ODI.\nDespite England's heavy defeat in the previous match their team remained unchanged while Sri Lanka also carried the same squad. England won the toss and elected to bat. Sri Lanka started in similar vein to the previous game and had England on 61/4. Collingwood and Owais Shah began the England recovery putting on 78 runs before Collingwood was out lbw. A stand of 70 between Swann and Shah followed allowing England to finish on 234/8.\nRyan Sidebottom and Stuart Broad disciplined bowling yielded four early wickets putting Sri Lanka on 38/4 after 14.1 overs. Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan started a recovery but after both their wickets fell within nine deliveries of each other the game was largely in England's control. From then on wickets fell at regular intervals and although Dilhara Fernando and Farveez Maharoof added 43 runs for the final wicket it was too much to ask for the final pair to win the match.\nShah was awarded man of the match with his score of 82 and was largely responsible for England setting a decent score of 234/8. This was the first win for England in Sri Lanka since 1982 while Shah's score of 82 was the highest ever for an Englishman in Sri Lanka. Winning captain Collingwood said he was delighted with his team's performance but wanted this match to be the benchmark for the rest of the series.\nTour matches.\nEnglish v Sri Lanka Cricket Board President's XI.\nAfter two tame days of bowling from the England squad which saw the president's XI reach an impressive 500 for 5, England took to the wicket for one day in this warm up match. The team started off well, an opening stand of 77 before Michael Vaughan, back up the order as an opener, was trapped LBW by Malinga Bandara. As top-scorer Alastair Cook reached his fifty, with seven fours, the rest of his teammates were investigating rumoured sittings of a snake underneath the advertising board. Only Kevin Pietersen fell cheaply, for 4, while the other top-order batsmen all retired after making semi-impressive starts to ensure as many batsmen could have a knock but the match was over as any kind of contest due to the poor performance of the 9 bowlers used.\nTest series.\n1st Test.\nThe first day of the tour was a dramatic one, and it ended up being England's most impressive one of the whole tour. Sri Lanka, having won the toss and chose to bat first, were reduced to 42/5 due to some highly impressive swing bowling by Matthew Hoggard. A 100 run partnership between Kumar Sangakkara (who top-scored with 92) and Prasanna Jayawardene (the keeper) followed to allow Sri Lanka to post a vaguely respectable score, but they were bowled out for 188. England made a confident reply, reaching 49/1 by the close of play, with the loss of Alastair Cook in the first over as the only blemish.\nEngland's innings proceeded well through the morning of day 2, with Ian Bell posting a fluent 83 before chipping a shot to midwicket. However, England then suffered a mini collapse, triggered by Muttiah Muralitharan, and slipped to 185/6 before rain curtailed the day's play. By this point, all eyes were on Muralitharan who was on the verge of overtaking Shane Warne's career haul of 708 test wickets.\nEngland resumed positively on day 3, with Ryan Sidebottom providing useful assistance to the remaining recognised batsman, Paul Collingwood. However, it would be Collingwood who eventually provided Muralitharan with his record-breaking dismissal, being clean bowled by the spinner. The wicket prompted scenes of mass celebration, and an ad-hoc presentation along with the awarding of a special trophy by senior Sri Lankan officials took place at the lunch break. Michael Vaughan attended this ceremony.\nAlongside all this, England were bowled out for 281, and took a useful 93 run lead into the second innings. However, the strength of this position quickly evaporated as Sri Lanka made a very good start to their second innings, with the openers (Sanath Jayasuriya and Michael Vandort) putting on 113. During this opening stand, Jayasuriya became only the second batsman to score six fours off a six-ball over in Test cricket (with James Anderson being the unfortunate bowler). After the day's proceedings, he announced his retirement from Test cricket.\nSri Lanka continued with a far more assertive batting display in their second innings. Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara dominated the first session, and Sangakkara became the first batsman ever to score 150 in each of four consecutive Tests. England's bowlers toiled throughout the day but struggled to contain the Sri Lankan batsman. Sri Lanka declared near to the close of play on 442/8, shortly after a swarm of bees had forced a halt in play with players and umpires all diving for cover!\nEngland lost Alastair Cook in the first over again, and needed to bat the final day out (or score an unlikely 350 to win). The biggest threat was clearly Muralitharan, and so it was therefore of some disappointment that the 4 wickets to fall during the morning session on the final day were to the seam bowlers. At 125/5 at lunch, their quest seemed doomed, but Ian Bell and Matt Prior batted for 45 overs through the tea break and beyond to give England a chance of a draw.\nHowever, Muralitharan had the last word when he dismissed both these well-set batsmen within an over of each other. Shortly afterwards, Ryan Sidebottom was dismissed to a controversial lbw decision (replays showed a big inside edge onto pad) which ended the stiffest of the resistance the lower order could offer. Matthew Hoggard was clean bowled by a Lasith Malinga yorker a few overs later, and Sri Lanka had won the match by 88 runs.\n2nd Test.\nFollowing the defeat in Kandy, England made two changes to their side. One was an enforced change, Matthew Hoggard having suffered an injury during the second innings. James Anderson was the other man to give way, with Stephen Harmison and Stuart Broad coming in. It was Broad's debut.\nSri Lanka's only change was enforced by Sanath Jayasuriya's retirement – Upul Tharanga replacing him at the top of the order. Jayasuriya was present at the Test match – but in the form of a TV commentator!\nEngland won the toss, chose to bat and made an impressive start to their innings, with the opening stand being worth 133 in 39 overs. Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 when he reached the top of the world rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to grab it before it hit the ground. Vaughan had made 87, and was very disappointed to have to leave the crease when he had the potential to make a very large score.\nUnusual dismissals were to be the theme of the day. Kevin Pietersen was given out to a catch that did not appear to have carried, and Alastair Cook fell victim to a questionable lbw decision. Ravi Bopara was clean bowled by Lasith Malinga next ball, and England closed the day on 258/5 – which was disappointing given the promising start.\nEngland suffered further losses early on day 2, with Paul Collingwood shouldering arms to a straight delivery, and Stuart Broad failing as a batsman on his debut. Matt Prior batted very well for 79, and only fell when trying to accelerate the scoring with 9 wickets down. Before this, Ryan Sidebottom had provided him with good assistance with a partnership worth 74. England were all out for 351 – a somewhat below par total, but something to work with for the bowlers.\nThe bowlers made a very good start in the Sri Lankan reply, with Sidebottom removing Tharanga and then the prize wicket of Kumar Sangakkara very cheaply. The score was 22/2 at this point. Stuart Broad had shared the new ball with Sidebottom and bowled impressively, although he did receive two warnings for running on the danger area of the pitch.\nHowever, this was as good as it got for England, as the Sri Lankan skipper, along with Michael Vandort proceeded to build a big partnership for the third wicket. They ended day 2 on 105/2, and carried on well into the afternoon session of day 3, and both picked up centuries in the process. Mahela Jayawardene also passed 7,000 test runs in his innings, the first Sri Lankan to achieve this milestone.\nEngland toiled hard for just 2 wickets on day 3, those of Vandort and Chamara Silva, and the score was 379/4 at the end of the day. Stephen Harmison bowled very well following his comeback from injury, and deserved more success than the one wicket (of Silva) he got.\nOn day 4, England managed to make further inroads into Sri Lanka's innings, but the lead was ballooning out of control. A 98-run partnership for the ninth wicket effectively killed their chance of winning the test. When Sri Lanka finally declared on 548/9, they led by 197 runs and with one day's play remaining; the only possible results were a Sri Lankan win or a draw.\nEngland's openers again posted a century partnership, the first time an English opening pair had done so for over 35 years. Michael Vaughan, Ian Bell and Alastair Cook all posted fifties to get up to parity with Sri Lanka and then take the lead. By tea, they had reached 250/3, but play was then brought to a halt due to rain, and the Test match drawn.\nMahela Jayawardene said after the match that he felt England's approach had been too negative, and they had eliminated their chances of winning by scoring too slowly in the first innings. He would go on to make similar comments at the end of the series.\n3rd Test.\nThe final test of the series was a poignant and emotional affair – it was the first Test match to take place at the Galle stadium since it had been destroyed by the tsunami three years prior. The teams of ground staff had worked tirelessly on getting the stadium ready for the match, and heavy rainfall a few days before did not stop them achieving this memorable feat. Following the match, both the teams and all the officials were quick to congratulate them on their fantastic work that allowed the match to go ahead.\nSri Lanka made two change – swapping out the underperforming Jehan Mubarak for Tillakaratne Dilshan, a three-dimensional player who many believe should never have been dropped from the side. His good batting record, useful bowling ability and world class fielding is nearly always an asset to Sri Lanka when he is on the team. The other change was to swap the injured Dilhara Fernando for a debutant, Chanaka Welegedara.\nEngland brought Matthew Hoggard back into the side, at the expense of Stuart Broad, despite an impressive debut in extremely difficult bowling conditions.\nEngland won the toss and chose to field – a decision which looked correct as the new ball bowlers found plenty of movement of the pitch. However, they failed to take advantage of this situation, and the two wickets earned during the first session of play were due to lbw decisions that the batsmen could consider themselves unlucky to get out to. The biggest wicket of the day for England was that of Kumar Sangakkara, who pulled a ball out to deep square leg into the waiting hands of Monty Panesar. He had scored 46, but looked set for a much larger score. At the end of the day's play, Sri Lanka were 147/4, but with Mahela Jayawardene still at the crease.\nDay 2 was a long and frustrating one for England, who were only able to take two wickets. Jayawardene and the recalled Dilshan batted for almost two sessions, before Dilshan was run out for 84 trying to give his captain the single that would earn him his century. England's only positive moment of the day occurring during the same over, where Ravi Bopara picked up his first test wicket when Prasanna Jayawardene edged the ball through to the keeper. Chaminda Vaas joined his captain at the crease and the two of them put on an unbroken 97, to take the score to 384/6.\nAny hopes England had of winning the test and squaring the series were eliminated on day 3. Jayawardene went on to score 213 not out, Vaas had scored 90 before being dismissed, and Sri Lanka declared on 499/8. But things then turned from bad to catastrophic for England, as they lost 4 wickets during a 20-minute passage of play before lunch. Two wickets then fell quickly after lunch too to leave England on 33/6. Ryan Sidebottom and Paul Collingwood managed a partnership of 37 before the lower order were blown away. England were bowled out for the pitiful total of 81.\nChaminda Vaas was the stand out bowler for Sri Lanka, taking 4 wickets, and Chanaka Welegedara took his first two test wickets, including that of Paul Collingwood which prevented England getting past 100.\nEngland received high levels of criticism for their first innings batting performance. Bob Willis, talking on Sky Sports' highlights show described it as \"an absolute disgrace\". Much debate was raised through a variety of media, calling factors into question such as the length of the tour (too short for three tests), the proximity to Christmas and the longer-term argument about the volume of cricket that teams have to play. Several of the fringe players came under scrutiny, too.\nHaving surrendered a first innings deficit of 416, England now had to bat for two days to save the game. They were able to do this with considerable assistance from the weather, which ensured that half the remaining available match time was wiped out. By the time the game was determined a draw late on day 5, England had reached 251/6 – a marked improvement on the first innings. Alastair Cook had scored 118, recording England's first and solitary century on the tour. Sri Lanka, in contrast, had scored 4. England suffered a scare when 3 wickets fell in four balls, including a first ball run out for Ravi Bopara, but they managed to avoid a defeat – which many felt they should not have. This was in contrast to the first match in Kandy, when they did deserve to escape with a draw, but did not.\nSeries result: a 1–0 win to Sri Lanka. Mahela Jayawardene raised points similar to what he said after the Colombo test, saying England's approach was too negative. Whilst his criticism was perhaps unjustified in the second test, it certainly was not here. England did appear to have given up during day 2, and this possibly acted as a catalyst for the poor batting performance that followed.\nEngland left Sri Lanka with concerns about some of their best players. Monty Panesar and Kevin Pietersen in particular had not enjoyed a good series, and many of the other players enjoyed good starts but were unable to maintain their consistency levels.\nSri Lanka on the other hand were much happier. Their side had climbed to 3rd place in the ICC Test Match rankings, with England slipping from 2nd to 5th. Their two best batsmen were in imperious form, their newer players were improving by the game and their bowling attack was delivering as a unit. At the end of the series, the world's top ranked test batsman and bowler were both Sri Lankan: Sangakkara and Muralitharan, respectively."

It is also sometimes abbreviated as 4BBB.\nIn a stroke play competition, competitors are paired and play as a team. Each golfer plays their own ball; the team's score on each hole is the lower of the two players' scores. Only one of a pair is required to complete each hole. The winners are the team with the lowest aggregate score over a set number of holes. Since 2017 this format, along with foursomes, has been used by the Zurich Classic on the PGA Tour.\nIn a match play competition, a four-ball consists of two teams of two players competing directly against each other. All four golfers play their own balls throughout the round (rather than alternating shots); each hole is won by the team whose member has the lowest score. This form of golf is commonly played in team golf competitions such as the Ryder Cup, Solheim Cup, and Presidents Cup."

        "title": "Asia Rugby Championship",
        "text": "The Asia Rugby Championship, or ARC, is an annual rugby union competition held amongst national rugby sides within the Asia Rugby region. The competition was originally known as the Asian Rugby Football Tournament when founded in 1969, and was called the Asian Five Nations from 2008 to 2014.\nThe winner of the competition's top division is recognised as the rugby champion of Asia. The top division, sometimes referred to as the Tri Nations, includes the top three Asian teams each season. Division 1 includes the next four teams and Division 2 includes the next four. Division three is further divided geographically, with each of the West, East and South Central divisions including three teams.\nAs of 2017, Japan is the most successful team, securing 25 out of a possible 30 titles since 1969. They have not participated in the series since 2017.\nHistory.\nThe competition was formed as the Asian Rugby Football Tournament in 1969. Chinese Taipei, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea and Thailand contested the inaugural Asian title. Japan were the champions on that occasion.\nThe tournament was held biennially for the most of its first four decades. It wasn't until 1982 that South Korea became the second team to win the title. The number of teams participating varied from year to year, with as many as 12 teams competing as other Asian teams joined the competition. From 1969 to 1996, there was a single division split into two groups. But in 1998, a second division was introduced as the game began to grow in Asia.\nIn 2003, a second Asian competition called the Asian Rugby Series was formed. The Asian Rugby Series ran alongside the Rugby Championship to help determine divisional allocations for the Asian Rugby Championship. With more teams competing, a third division was added to the Rugby Championship in 2004. The dual competitions ran until 2007.\nAsian Five Nations (2008–14).\nIn 2008, the ARFU merged the Rugby Championship and Rugby Series into the Asian Five Nations. The competition became an annual championship and a promotion-relegation format was introduced. The winner of Division 2 replaced the loser of Division 1, and the winner of Division 1 replaced the loser of the Five Nations. For its inaugural years, no Division 3 took place, though several regional divisions were implemented across Asia. During the time of this competition, the main Five Nations division was dominated by Japan, South Korea and Hong Kong; the only three teams never to have been relegated to a lower division.\nAsia Rugby Championship (2015 onward).\nThe competition was revamped again for the 2015 season as the Asia Rugby Championship. Under the new format, the top three teams formed a Tri nations division. A promotion-relegation challenge was instituted whereby the Division 1 winner had to defeat the Tri nations third place-getter to gain promotion for the next season.\nFormat.\nThe current format sees the competition separated into various divisions, with a promotion and relegation format operated into each division. However, this only applies to Division 1 through 3, as the loser of the Tri Nations Division will play a play-off match against the winner of Division 1 to determine the third Tri Nations team for the following year. Where as the winners of Division 2 will automatically replace the loser of Division 1, and the two bottom placed teams in Division 2 will both be relegated down to one of the three regions in Division 3; West, East or South Central. Each of the three regions are made up three teams, and as of 2015, only the winners of the South Central and East divisions can be promoted to Division 2. This is because, the teams competing in the West region, are not considered as full members by World Rugby.\nIn 2015 in the main Tri Nations division, each team played each other on a home and away basis, picking up 5 points for a win and 3 for a draw. 2 additional points are up for grabs through bonus points, but in order to earn them, teams need to score 4 or more tries in a match, or when losing, lose by 7 points or less. In 2016 the points awarded were changed to 4 points for a win and 1 point for a draw with bonus points the same. For all Divisions, 1 through to 3, nations will only play each other once, with one of the included teams hosting all matches at home. These teams will also aim to pick points up for a win or draw, and gain bonus points. For all divisions, the team with the most table points wins their respective divisions, and if possible, earns promotion to the next division.\nCurrent divisions.\nAs of 2024, the competition divisions are:\n \nPrevious winners.\nAll-time summary.\nAs of the 2023 Asia Rugby Championship.\nAsia Rugby Championship.\nNotes:\n Relegated to the division below\n Able to be challenged by the winner of the division below to play in a promotion-relegation play-off.\n Japan—as hosts of the 2019 Rugby World Cup–did not defend their Asia rugby Championship title in 2018 to allow the Tri Nations competition to form part of the 2019 Rugby World Cup – Asia qualification process. Instead of returning to the trinations for 2019, Japan played the Pacific Nations to prepare for the World Cup. \nDivision tournaments.\nNotes:\n Relegated to the division below.\n Won promotion, or the right to a challenge play-off for promotion, to the division above."

He played for the New Orleans Saints from 1967 to 1969 and he finished his career with the Miami Dolphins in 1970. He was also a football actor in the 1969 Charlton Heston movie Number One featuring the New Orleans Saints.\nTed played collegiately at the wide receiver/end position from 1961 to 1963 for Georgia Tech and was inducted into the Georgia Tech Hall of Fame in 1980.

The officials penalized Ted Davis and Rawson ended up having to go to the hospital. The following Monday, Ted Davis publicly apologized and owned up to his mistake made in anger during the game. He submitted his resignation to Coach Bobby Dodd and the Georgia Tech football team wishing to save Georgia Tech from the embarrassment of having to kick him off the team. He admitted that his actions violated every standard Coach Dodd had set for the team and he asked for Rawson's forgiveness. Ted was well respected at Georgia Tech and owned up to his mistake.\nThis incident was reminiscent of the so-called \"Chick Granning-Darwin Holt Incident\" from the Georgia Tech / Alabama game two years earlier but the outcomes were quite different. During this incident \"an Alabama player damaged a Tech player in the heat of battle\" by elbowing him in the face. Apparently this elbowing incident by Holt resulted in Granning being hospitalized and unable to play football for the rest of the year. Holt apologized for the incident but no further action was taken by the SEC or Alabama and he remained on the team.\nTed Davis worked as a Football Umpire in the SEC from 1984 until at least 1989.

It was equaled in 1976 by Raymond Floyd and surpassed in 1997 by Tiger Woods' 270 (−18). Nicklaus' winning margin of nine strokes also stood until 1997, when Woods was victorious by twelve strokes to win his first green jacket. It was the fourth of a record 18 major titles won by Nicklaus in his career.\nThe \"Big Three\" (Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Gary Player) were tied for the lead after 36 holes at 138 (−6), but Nicklaus shot a 64 (−8) on Saturday to post a 202 (−14), a gain of five shots on Player and eight on Palmer. Nicklaus' round tied the course record set by Lloyd Mangrum in the first round in 1940; it was lowered to 63 by Nick Price in the third round in 1986.\nNicklaus totally over-powered the Augusta National course, hitting short-irons into most of the par four holes and mid-irons into many of the par five holes, especially during his record-tying third round 64.

        "text": "The 1966 Masters Tournament was the 30th Masters Tournament, held April 7–11 at Augusta National Golf Club in Augusta, Georgia.\nJack Nicklaus, age 26, earned his third Green Jacket in an 18-hole Monday playoff and became the first back-to-back champion at the Masters. He ended regulation at even-par 288, tied with Tommy Jacobs and Gay Brewer. Nicklaus shot a 70 in the extra round on Monday to defeat Jacobs (72) and Brewer (78). Nicklaus' score the previous year in 1965 was significantly lower at 271 (−17), a record which stood for 32 years.\nOn Sunday, Brewer shot a 33 (−3) on the front nine and then had eight pars as he came to the 72nd hole with a one-shot lead. After hitting his approach shot onto the green, he three-putted from , missing a putt for par to win. This was the last Masters that two-time champion Byron Nelson played in; he shot 76 and 78 and missed the cut by one stroke. The 36-hole cut at 153 (+9) was the highest to date, exceeded only in 1982.\nA close friend of Nicklaus was among four that died in a private plane crash in Tennessee on Wednesday, while en route to Augusta from Columbus, Ohio. Nicklaus learned of the incident late that night and responded with a 68 in the first round, but fell back with a 76 on Friday.\nIt was the fifth of 18 major titles for Nicklaus, and his only successful defense of a major. Three months later, he completed the first of his three career grand slams at Muirfield in the Open Championship. Later back-to-back winners at Augusta were Nick Faldo (1989 and 1990, both playoffs) and Tiger Woods (2001 and 2002).\nTerry Dill won the seventh Par 3 contest on Wednesday with a score of 22.\nBrewer rebounded and won the tournament the next year, while Nicklaus' attempt at three consecutive titles ended early with a rare missed cut. Jacobs never won a major; he was also a runner-up in the U.S. Open in 1964 at Congressional.\nCBS commentator Jack Whitaker referred to the gallery at the end of the 18-hole Monday playoff as a \"mob\" and was banned from the next five Masters (1967–1971).\nCourse.\n^ \nField.\nJack Burke Jr. (4,10), Doug Ford, Claude Harmon, Ben Hogan (8), Herman Keiser, Cary Middlecoff (2), Byron Nelson (8), Jack Nicklaus (2,4,8,10), Arnold Palmer (2,3,8,11), Henry Picard, Gary Player (2,3,4,8,9), Gene Sarazen, Sam Snead (10), Art Wall Jr.\nTommy Bolt (8), Julius Boros (9,11), Billy Casper (10,11), Gene Littler (8,9,11), Dick Mayer, Ken Venturi (11)\nTony Lema (8,9,11)\nJerry Barber, Dow Finsterwald (8), Jay Hebert, Lionel Hebert, Dave Marr (10,11), Bobby Nichols, Bob Rosburg\nDeane Beman (6,9,a), William C.

        "text": "The Palau dels Esports de Barcelona (Barcelona Sports Palace) is a multi-purpose indoor arena in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. It is on Lleida Street on the slopes of Montjuïc, a hill to the south east of the city centre.\nThe arena is able to host competitions of any indoor sport. In 2000 it was adapted to better accommodate theatre and musical shows and given a new name: Barcelona Teatre Musical. The seating capacity was reduced from 8,000 to 3,500, but comfort and the acoustic quality were enhanced.\nHistory.\nInaugurated in 1955 for the Mediterranean Games, it was designed by the architect Josep Soteras.\nIt was the only indoor arena of its type in Barcelona until 1971 when FC Barcelona inaugurated the Palau Blaugrana. Even after this, the Palau dels Esports continued to be the only indoor arena in public hands: for this reason it continued to host the main sporting, social, cultural and musical events that took place in the city.\nDuring the 1980s it was the home of the RCD Espanyol basketball team, which for several seasons competed in the ACB.\nIt was remodelled in 1986 by the architect Francesc Labastida for the group E games of the World Basketball Championship of 1986.\nAt the beginning of the 1990s activity in the arena began to diminish. The basketball team disappeared and in 1990 the Palau Sant Jordi was inaugurated, attracting many of the top events from that date on.\nThe venue hosted rhythmic gymnastics and the preliminary phase of the volleyball for the 1992 Summer Olympics. This proved to be its sporting swansong, however, and from the mid-1990s it concentrated on hosting drama, music and comedy."

        "text": "Jamie Baker (born 5 August 1986) is a retired British professional male tennis player, who was British No. 2 in 2008.\nHe won the first match of Leon Smith's tenure as Davis Cup captain, in the tie against Turkey, helping Great Britain to a first Davis Cup win in three years.\nBaker has twelve Futures single titles; in doubles, he has 1 Challenger and four Futures titles.\nAfter retiring from tennis, Baker moved into Corporate Finance for a bank, whilst also being a part-time television pundit for Eurosport and the BBC.\nEarly and personal life.\nBaker's parents are Gordon and Lynn, and he has an older brother Steven. Baker first picked up a tennis racket at four, and holidayed at Center Parcs where he and Steven would win adult competitions.\nBaker went to junior tournaments all over the UK, and met the Murray brothers. Their mother Judy Murray counselled the Bakers that the best way to progress, would be for Jamie to leave home and move to the LTA Tennis Academy in Loughborough. Lynne and Gordon met host families who might look after their son, but decided they couldn't let Jamie go by himself. Gordon relocated to his company's office in Loughborough, while Lynn stayed in Glasgow. At Loughborough, Baker realised that he was in the second tier of junior players, but he was the only one in his group dedicated enough to compete on the senior tour.\nHis brother Steven is an international squash player.\nJunior career.\nHe had a fairly successful junior career, peaking as high as 6 in the junior ITF rankings. He reached the quarter-finals of junior Wimbledon in 2004, and in the same year won the 18 and under national championships. He won a grade 1 junior event in Venezuela, before turning professional at the age of 18.\nSenior career.\n2005–06.\nIn 2005 Jamie began playing on the futures and challengers tours. His most successful challenger result was a quarter-final at the Burnie Challenger in February 2006. He made his ATP Tour debut by virtue of wild cards at the 2006 Artois Championship and played at the 2006 Wimbledon Championships.\nBaker made his debut for the Great Britain Davis Cup team in September 2006 in the crucial relegation play-off against the Ukraine. Great Britain won the tie 3–2, although Jamie lost his match, the fifth rubber, 6–3 7–6 against Sergei Bubka.\n2007.\nBaker continued in Challenger tournaments, reaching the final in Waikoloa and making semi finals at places like Lexington and Knowville. He also achieved his first ATP Tour victory, against Alexander Peya, at the 2007 Artois Championships.\nHe made a second Davis Cup appearance in the World Group Play-off against Croatia on No. 1 Court, Wimbledon in September. With Great Britain leading 4–0, Baker played the dead rubber, losing 6–4 6–4 against Marin Čilić. Britain won the tie 4–1 and qualified for the 2008 World Group. He finished the season ranked as Britain's number 3 player.\nIn November, he was invited to practise with Pete Sampras at his home.\n2008.\nBaker made a positive start to 2008 by qualifying for the Australian Open. He disposed of 9th seed (Q) Yuri Shukin 6–2 6–0 and then battling past Alexander Peya 6–4 7–6 to reach the final round where he defeated Daniel Köllerer 6–4\n6–4. Though he was defeated in the first round by Ivo Karlović, his result of 6–4 6–4 6–7 6–4 was described as highly creditable\nBaker later played in his first 'live' Davis Cup rubber in the World Group first round match against Argentina. Though he lost the opener to David Nalbandian (#9), and with Argentina winning 4–0, he gained his first Davis Cup win by beating clay court specialist Agustín Calleri (#41) 7–6, 6–4 in the final tie of the match. When the match finished, the Argentine fans who had been jeering throughout, rose as one to give him a standing ovation. Argentina had won their last ten home encounters 5–0, so Baker prevented the 2006 finalists taking their 11th successive 5–0 victory.\nFollowing the Davis Cup, Jamie won 2 consecutive titles in $15,000 Futures Tournaments in Brownsville, Texas and Harlingen, Texas, becoming 211 in the world and British No 2.\nBaker contracted Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP) in April, and had to spend three days in intensive care in Florida. Fellow Scot Jamie Murray noted that he was lucky to be alive. Baker had been likely to miss Wimbledon as a result, but was granted a wildcard for the tournament. He lost in the first round 4–6 2–6 3–6 to the Italian Stefano Galvani. \nITP was debilitating; unable to train at his previous intensity for more than a year, and with the problem exacerbated by further injuries, Baker's ranking plummeted to 427 by the year's end.\n2009.\nBaker began the 2009 season playing on the futures tour, but won just twice in his first six tournaments of the year. In July he reached the semi-final of the Gyeongsan event in Korea and in August reached the same stage of two tournaments in Thailand, before winning the event in Nonthaburi, Thailand at the end of the month. In September and October he played four futures events in Australia, winning in two and was runner-up in the others. Following this he returned to the challenger tour, losing his first qualifying match in Charlottesville to Jermaine Jenkins. A week later he qualified for the main draw in Knoxville and won his first round tie against Raven Klaasen before losing to Taylor Dent in the second round. He also reached the second round of the events in Champaign, Illinois and Puebla, Mexico later in November.\nBaker partnered fellow Briton Chris Eaton at the start of the year, the pair winning the Glasgow futures event. They lost in the first round of their next event. Baker partnered Australian Mark McCook in Korea, but again lost in the first round. In August he resumed his partnership with Eaton and they reached the final of the Great Britain 11 futures event. In his next two doubles events, Baker partnered Australian Dane Propoggia, reaching the final of the first futures event, but losing in the first round of the second. With his move up to the Challenger tour, Baker partnered Australian Nima Roshan in Puebla, reaching the semi-final.\n2010.\nRather than begin the year in Australia trying to qualify for the Australian Open, Baker chose to play in Futures events in the United Kingdom. He reached the final of the first one, losing to Chris Eaton in Glasgow.\nIn May, Baker won his only Challenger title, playing doubles with James Ward at the Savannah Challenger.\nIn July, James Ward beat Baker in the final of the Great Britain F8 Futures in Manchester.\nThe new Davis Cup Captain Leon Smith selected Baker to take part in Great Britain's vital Davis Cup tie vs Turkey, at Eastbourne, in July alongside James Ward, Ken Skupski, Colin Fleming and Alex Ward(non player). Defeat would have meant Great Britain's relegation to Europe Zone Group III. Baker played his part in the victory by winning both his singles matches, Britain eventually triumphing 5–0, and giving Great Britain a first Davis Cup win in three years.\n2011.\nIn March, Leon Smith announced his team for the Euro/Africa Zone Group II tie against Tunisia, but he sprang a surprise, omitting Alex Bogdanovic, having recalled the 26-year-old to the squad after a three-year absence. Instead, Smith's singles players were Ward (No 214) who lost at the first hurdle in six of his seven tournaments this year. and Baker (No 406), who had lost first time out in his last two events. Although Bogdanovic (No 374) had lost all six of his live Davis Cup rubbers, he had at least won a Futures tournament in the United States this year. Baker lost his opening singles match, but won his dead rubber, contributing to Great Britain's 4–1 victory.\n2012.\nIn December, Baker spent nearly a month with his close friend Andy Murray at his luxurious winter training base in Miami, along with James Ward, Ross Hutchins and Oliver Golding.\n2013.\nBaker qualified for the main draw of the 2013 Australian Open, beating Donald Young in three sets in the final qualifier. He was defeated by Lukáš Rosol of the Czech Republic in the first round.\nIn May, Baker decided to retire, but wanted to have one more go by playing on his best surface, grass.\nThere was success in the preliminaries in Nottingham and at Queens, and then for his last match, defeat in the second round of Wimbledon qualifying, against Igor Kunitsyn, a Russian baseliner who had once been in the top 50.\nOn 29 June Baker announced his retirement from tennis."

        "title": "Lester Park Golf Course",
        "text": "Lester Park Golf Course is one of two public golf courses located in the port city of Duluth, Minnesota. The original eighteen-hole golf course was made up the north shore of Duluth, near the Lester Park River. The golf course was established in 1934. The other course, Enger Park, is located near the Duluth landmark, Enger Tower, and was established earlier than Lester in the 1920s. Lester Park is well known around Minnesota for its spectacular beauty and rich history as a golf course because a unique view of Lake Superior is available on 20 of the 27 golf holes. The original 18 holes have been redone four times since their initial design. In 1997, Paul Schintz, a former club pro from St. Paul, took over Lester Park as PGA Golf Professional. In 2003, Schintz became the Director of Golf, overseeing both Lester Park and Enger Park clubhouse operations. The golf courses were split to a 2 golf pro / 2 contract setup in 2005 with the addition of Steve Anderson to Enger Park Golf Course, with Schintz remaining at Lester Park. In 2007, the Duluth city council voted to accept a contract with Professional Golf Management, Inc. The Management company consisted of partners Schintz, as PGA Golf Professional and Jud Crist, Golf Course Superintendent. The management company now operates both facilities for the City of Duluth, overseeing clubhouse and maintenance operations. Management Inc.\nLester Park's front and back nines are a full par 72 golf course and has a yardage of 6,828 yards from the hardest tees.\nHistory.\nThe history of the golf course started with the glaciation of Minnesota providing a rich landscape of hills and fertile soil; prime golf course potential to the developers of Duluth. The current course that was available at the time was too far for some people to commit to so the city decided to build another golf course in 1934 out in the northeastern part of the city. The land for city development in Lakeside was donated in 1890 by Oliver Iron Mining president Thomas Cole.\nThe course.\nThe golf course has 27 holes with an 18-hole course and then a tougher, more challenging, 9-hole course. The grass itself in the fairway is a bluegrass of the Poa Genus. The greens were originally designed with Bermuda Grass but due to recent harsh weathers the grass on the green has been switched in many spots to bentgrass due to bent's ability to survive in harsher conditions, and for its ability to be cut at very short lengths without being damaged and allowing for a lot of foot traffic at the same time. The course contains four different sets of tee boxes ranging from a red colored tee, known for being the shortest distance to the hole; the farthest tees are blue colored. A group making tee times at the golf course, unless larger than 10 people can usually call up to one week in advance to obtain a desired tee time. The Cancellation policy as stated on their website says that 24 hours in the maximum time to cancel."

        "text": "The 1992 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on January 1, 1992, the 78th Rose Bowl Game. Before 103,566 in attendance in Pasadena, California, and a national television audience, the No. 2 Washington Huskies defeated the No. 4 Michigan Wolverines, 34–14.\nWashington defensive tackle Steve Emtman and quarterback Billy Joe Hobert were named the Players Of The Game. The undefeated Washington Huskies were named the national champions by the Coaches Poll after being left at No. 2 in the AP poll, behind the Miami Hurricanes.\nPre-game activities.\nOn October 22, 1991, the Tournament of Roses selected 17-year-old Tannis Ann Turrentine, a senior at Mayfield Senior School and a resident of Pasadena, as the 74th Rose Queen of the 103rd Tournament of Roses. The 1991–92 Tournament of Roses Royal Court was led by the reigning Rose Queen with six rose princesses: Laurie Fortier, San Marino; Malia Herndon, Altadena; Erin Christine Mispagel, Pasadena; Mia Rodinella, Pasadena; Kristen Colleen Russell, La Canada Flintridge; and Melissa Ann Tyson, Pasadena.\nGame summary.\nAfter a scoreless first quarter, a 7–7 tie in the second, and 13–7 Husky advantage at halftime, the 1992 game became the most lopsided contest between two top-5 teams in Rose Bowl history. Trailing 34–7, a late Michigan touchdown against Husky reserves closed the gap in the final score to 20 points. With a minute remaining and the third-string quarterback leading the offense, Washington opted to run out the clock from the Michigan five-yard line, rather than run up the score.\nThis was the first Rose Bowl since the beginning of the Big Ten–Pacific 10 (originally the Pacific Coast Conference) contract that officials from a neutral conference (in this case, the Southeastern Conference) were used. From 1947 through 1991, a split crew of Big Ten and Pac-10 (Pac-8/AAWU/PCC; now Pac-12) officials were used. From 1984, the first year a seven-man officiating crew was used, through 1991, the conference of the designated home team provided the referee, back judge, one wing official on the line of scrimmage (head linesman or line judge) and one deep wing official (field judge or side judge), and the other conference provided the umpire, one wing official on the line of scrimmage and one deep wing official. The Rose Bowl was the last bowl to use split officiating crews; most bowl games abandoned them in favor of neutral officials in the 1970s, although the Orange Bowl used a split crew from the SEC and Big Ten for its 1978 game.\nSplit crews were banned by the NCAA starting in 1999.\nScoring.\nFirst quarter.\n\"None\", tied 0–0\nSecond quarter.\nWash. - Hobert, 2-yard run (Hanson kick) - Wash. 7–0&lt;br&gt; \nMich. - Smith, 9-yard pass from Grbac (Carlson kick) - tied 7–7&lt;br&gt; \nWash. - Hanson, 24-yard field goal - Wash. 10–7&lt;br&gt;\nWash. - Hanson, 23-yard field goal - Wash. 13–7\nThird quarter.\nWash. - Bruener, 5-yard pass from Hobert (Pierce, pass from Hobert, 2 pts.) - Wash. 21–7\nFourth quarter.\nWash. - Pierce, 2-yard pass from Hobert (kick failed) - Wash. 27–7&lt;br&gt; \nWash. - Bailey, 38-yard pass from Brunell (Hanson kick) - Wash. 34–7&lt;br&gt; \nMich. - Wheatley, 53-yard run (Carlson kick) - Wash. 34–14\nSplit national championship.\nMiami won by only four points in the final AP Poll, while Washington won by nine points in the Coaches' Poll.\nA fantasy article in \"Sports Illustrated\" titled \"The Dream Game\" had the Huskies narrowly defeat Miami in a playoff."

Listed at , 180 lb., Ferguson batted and threw right-handed. \nBorn in Montclair, New Jersey, Ferguson was raised in nearby Bloomfield. He died in Sepulveda, California, at age 79.\nProfessional career.\nFerguson was one of the first forkball specialists in major league history. He entered the majors in 1918 with the New York Yankees, playing for them two years (1918, 1921) before joining the Boston Red Sox (1922–1925), Washington Senators (1925–1926), again the Yankees (1925), and with the Philadelphia Phillies (1927–1929) and Brooklyn Robins (1925). He enjoyed his highest win season in 1924 with the seventh-place Red Sox, when he won 14 games while losing an American League-high 17. In 1925 he divided his playing time with Boston, New York and Washington, ending with a 5–1 mark and a 3.25 ERA in seven games for the Senators AL champion team. During the World Series, he pitched well against the Pittsburgh Pirates, going 1–1 with a 3.21 ERA in two starts.\nIn a 10-season career, Ferguson posted a 61–85 record with 397 strikeouts and a 4.89 ERA in 257 appearances, including 166 starts, 62 complete games, two shutouts, 10 saves, and innings of work. \nIn 1926 Ferguson set a major league record for the highest ERA during a regular season by a pitcher who started a postseason game the same year. Ferguson collected a combined 6.18 ERA while pitching with the Red Sox, Yankees and Senators. The mark was broken in 2006 by Óliver Pérez of the New York Mets, who posted a 6.55 ERA during the regular season before starting Game 4 of the NL Championship Series."

        "text": "Andrew Howard Cohen (October 25, 1904 – October 29, 1988), nicknamed the \"Tuscaloosa Terror\", was an American professional baseball player, coach, and manager. He played as a second baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Giants, from to . Cohen was an interim manager for the Philadelphia Phillies in .\nEarly life.\nCohen was born in Baltimore, Maryland, to Jewish parents who had been born in Europe. Though most sources give his full birth name as \"Andrew Howard Cohen,\" a July 1928 profile published in \"The New York Times\" calls him \"Andrew Jackson Cohen\", citing his insistence on retaining his name despite pressure to change it, saying that \"he had done pretty well up to then as Andrew Jackson Cohen and he would continue under that name\", besides it would hurt his mother to play under an assumed name. He was the brother of Syd Cohen, who pitched in the major leagues from 1934 to 1937.\nCohen's family moved to El Paso, Texas, when he was four years old. Cohen was a star at El Paso High School in baseball, basketball, and football. He was awarded a scholarship to the University of Alabama, where he played all three sports for the Alabama Crimson Tide.\nCareer.\nMinor leagues.\nCohen left college early and signed a minor league contract to play in the Texas League. In 1925 Cohen batted .312 for Waco of the Texas League.\nIn 1927, he batted .353 for the Buffalo Bisons, with a .508 slugging percentage. In 1931 he batted .317 for Newark of the International League.\nNew York Giants.\nCohen's success in the Texas League drew the attention of John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants, who had been looking to sign a Jewish player to help draw crowds to compete with the New York Yankees and Babe Ruth playing across the Harlem River. In May 1926, the Giants purchased Cohen's contract for $20,000 ($ today) from the Waco team in the Texas League.\nCohen debuted in a May 31, 1926, game against the Philadelphia Phillies, with a pinch hit single to center field batting for Frankie Frisch, and an assist in the field. Cohen batted .257 in 32 games with the Giants in the 1926 season, with 9 hits (including a triple) in 35 at bats. Cohen played 10 games at second, 10 as shortstop, and two at third base. McGraw gave Cohen the option to stay with the team, but Cohen chose to be sent to Buffalo of the International League, where he would have an opportunity to be an everyday player.\nThe Sporting News wrote that he had: \"all the natural characteristics (physically) of his race — thick, dark hair, dark skin and keen mentality.\"\nWith the slot at second base filled by Rogers Hornsby with the parent team, Cohen spent the 1927 season in Buffalo, with his .353 batting average leading the team to a league title. He was warmly welcomed by Buffalo's Jewish community, which held an \"Andy Cohen Day\" in which he was bestowed with gifts, including a diamond ring from fans and a black onyx ring from a jewelry store, among other gifts.\nHornsby had played 155 games at second base in the 1927 season, but he was traded by the Giants to the Boston Braves in January 1928, freeing up a slot for Cohen. With the Mayor of New York City, Jimmy Walker, on hand to throw out the first ball at the 1928 Opening Day game, Cohen led the Giants to a 5–3 victory over the Boston Braves, hitting two singles and a double, knocking in two runs, and scoring two. Thousands of fans rushed onto the field after the game and carried Cohen off the field on their shoulders. As the Giants' regular second baseman, Cohen had his best season in the major leagues in 1928, batting .274 with 24 doubles, 7 triples, and 9 home runs, as on defense he was fourth in the NL in double plays turned by a second baseman (90). The Giants played on his success on the field, with vendors selling \"Ice Cream Cohens\" in the concession stands at the Polo Grounds. The \"Los Angeles Times\" called the Giants' promotion of Cohen one of \"the most efficient job of ballyhoo that has been performed in the sport industry...\" \"Time\" magazine noted his popularity, reporting on a note from an adoring fan that read \"I understand you are Jewish and single... if you would care to meet a brunette... Anyway drop me a little note...\", one of hundreds Cohen said he had received.\nHe was part of a vaudeville act, telling jokes and singing parodies with Shanty Hogan, an Irish teammate from the Giants who played catcher for the team. After the 1928 season they started performing on the Loew Circuit, with their first appearance on stage at the Loew's Commodore Theatre in the Manhattan on October 15, 1928. The duo earned $1,800 ($ today) a week, billed as \"Cohen &amp; Hogan\" except in Boston, when the billings were reversed. In a 1960 interview, Cohen reminisced that \"if we didn't kill vaudeville, we sure helped.\"\nCohen batted .294 in 101 games with the Giants in the 1929 season, hitting 12 doubles, two triples, and five home runs, while leading the league in range factor per nine innings by a second baseman (6.33), and playing what turned out to be his final major league game on October 5, 1929. The Giants sent Cohen to Newark during the 1929 season, to help refine Cohen's fielding. Cohen batted .318 and set an International League record with 59 consecutive errorless games. McGraw told Cohen that he would be called back up to the majors, and that day he broke his leg, never to play in the big leagues again.\nAfter the major leagues.\nCohen played for the Newark Bears from 1929 until June 1932, when he was assigned to Minneapolis of the American Association. Despite the leg injury, Cohen led all International League second baseman in 1931 with a fielding percentage of .985, with 11 errors in 323 putouts and 412 assists, in addition to 66 double plays. With Minneapolis in 1933, Cohen led all American Association second basemen with a fielding percentage of .981 in 121 games.\nCohen was inducted into the United States Army on May 26, 1942, reporting to Fort Niagara. He was a first sergeant with the 21st Engineers, and saw action in Italy and Africa.\nAfter the war, Cohen continued his career as a manager in the minor leagues. Cohen managed the Denver Bears, then of the Western League, from 1951 to 1954, leading the team to a championship in his final season. After Ralph Houk was named as a coach of the New York Yankees for the 1958 season, Cohen was chosen to fill Houk's spot as manager of the Denver Bears, then the Yankees' top minor league team in the American Association. He was a minor league manager after his playing career ended from 1939 to 1957.\nIn 1956–57, Cohen managed the Chesterfield Smokers of the Panamanian Professional Baseball League.\nCohen was also a coach with the Philadelphia Phillies in 1960. After manager Eddie Sawyer stepped down after losing the first game of the season, the Phillies hired Gene Mauch as his replacement, but had Cohen manage one game before Mauch could join the team, leading the Phillies to a 5–4 win in ten innings over the Milwaukee Braves. This was the only game Cohen ever managed in the major leagues, leaving him with a perfect record as a manager.\nHe returned to his hometown, where he coached the baseball team at the University of Texas at El Paso for 17 years.\nCohen died 4 days after his 84th birthday and 6 months after his brother Syd in El Paso, Texas on October 29, 1988.\nIn 1989, the El Paso Diablos moved into Cohen Stadium, a 9,725-seat stadium that was named in honor of Andy and his brother Syd."

        "text": "The major national club competition in France is the Top 14 (formerly, the Top 16). The Top 14 is played on a home and away basis between the top fourteen club sides in France. The second major competition in France is the Rugby Pro D2 competition. A relegation system exists between the two tiers of competition. Both competitions are operated by Ligue Nationale de Rugby (LNR).\nBelow the professional leagues are the Nationale, Nationale 2, Fédérale 1, Fédérale 2, Fédérale 3 and a number of lower leagues.\nTop 14.\nThere exists a promotion and relegation system between the Top 14 and Pro D2. From the 2017–18 season, the bottom club after the regular season is relegated to Pro D2 and replaced by the Pro D2 champion, now determined by a six-team knockout playoff. The second-from-bottom Top 14 side enters a playoff with the runner-up of the Pro D2 playoffs, with the winner either remaining in or promoted to Top 14. Since the 2009–10, the knock-out stages for the Top 14 have involved six teams and consist of three rounds. The top two teams on the ladder receive a bye into the semi-finals, while the next four teams on the ladder play in the first round, with the third and fourth-place teams each hosting a match. The winners of those matches face the top two teams in the semi-finals, which are held at neutral sites, and the semi-final winners advance to the final at Stade de France (the traditional site, although the 2016 final was held at Camp Nou in Barcelona due to conflict with UEFA Euro 2016).\nWith Europe's former top club competition, the Heineken Cup, being superseded by the European Rugby Champions Cup from 2014–15, the qualification method for all nations changed slightly. This, however, did not affect the number of French teams assured of Champions Cup qualification—as in the Heineken Cup era (1996–2014), six Top 14 teams are assured of Champions Cup places in the following season. The top six teams on the Top 14 table earn Champions Cup places. A seventh French club can qualify by winning a play-off following the club season. From the 2016–17 season forward, this playoff will involve the seventh-place teams from the Top 14 and English Premiership, plus the top two teams from Pro14 that (1) did not automatically qualify for the Champions Cup and (2) are not from South Africa.\nAll Top 14 teams that do not qualify for the Champions Cup, including the teams newly promoted from Pro D2, will play in the Challenge Cup.\nPro D2.\nPro D2 is the second level of domestic club rugby, below the first division, Top 14. At present, 16 clubs compete in the competition.\nBeginning in 2017–18, Pro D2 adopted a playoff system identical to that used by the Top 14, with the first and second-placed teams receiving byes into the semifinals, where they await winners of quarterfinals that involve the third- through sixth-place teams. The winner of the playoff becomes the league champion and receives an automatic promotion to the next season's Top 14; the runner-up enters a playoff with the 13th-place team from Top 14, with the winner either remaining in or promoted to Top 14. This replaced a system in which the top club at the end of the season was automatically promoted to the Top 14, with the 2nd through 5th place teams playing each other for the second promotion place.\nNationale 1.\nThe Nationale division is the third division nationally and was created in June 2020 for introduction in the 2020-2021 season. With the introduction of the Nationale 2 division in the 2022 - 2023 season, this became National 1, though is still referred to as \"Nationale\". \n14 clubs compete on a round-robin basis over a regular season of 26 games. As with Pro D2, the top two teams at the end of the season qualify directly for the semifinals. Places 3 - 6 playoff in quarter-finals (3rd v 6th, 4th v 5th). Unlike Pro D2, Semifinals are played over two legs (home and away) with the aggregate winners playing the final. The winner of the final is automatically promoted to Pro D2, with the loser playing off against the second last team in the Pro D2 table. The winner of this match is promoted (or stays) in Pro D2, the loser is demoted (or stays) in Nationale 1.\nThe last two teams in the table are directly relegated to National 2 at the end of the regular season.\nNationale 2.\nNationale 2 is French rugby's fourth division. Introduced in the 2022-2023, the format of the competition follows that of Nationale over two pools of 12 clubs. As with Nationale, at the end of the regular season, both pool's top 2 teams automatically qualify for their respective semifinals, with positions 3 - 6 playing off in the quarter-finals.

In 2007-08, the club played in France's second professional level, Rugby Pro D2, but finished bottom of the table. This automatically led to their relegation to the first amateur level, Fédérale 1, but a postseason audit revealed financial problems serious enough that French sporting authorities forcibly relegated them further to Fédérale 2.

        "text": "The Serbia men's national volleyball team is the national team of Serbia. FIVB and CEV considers Serbia the inheritor of the records of SFR Yugoslavia (1948–1991) and Serbia and Montenegro (1992–2006). Serbia won gold at the Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia and bronze at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.\nThe Yugoslav Olympic Committee declared the national volleyball team to be the best male team of the year in 2000, and the Olympic Committee of Serbia did the same in 2010 and 2013.\nHistory.\nSerbia's most proud moment came at the Sydney Olympics in 2000 when under the name Yugoslavia it won Olympic gold. A heavy favourite was team Italy, who won the last three World Championships and the European title in 1995 and 1999, but they had yet to win an Olympic gold medal. They swept through Group B undefeated and won their quarter-final match over Australia. In the semifinals, Serbia &amp; Montenegro (Yugoslavia), runners-up at the 1998 Worlds, and bronze medalists at the 1999 Europeans, triumphed in straight sets, again denying Italy an Olympic gold medal. Serbia &amp; Montenegro had struggled in the pools, finishing only third behind Italy and Russia, but they defeated Russia in straight sets in the final to win the gold medal. As in 1996, all medalists came from the same pool, this time Group B.\nVolleyball was brought to Serbia by g. William Viland, a professor of folklore and folk sports from Oakland, California, when the Red Cross held a series of lectures and demonstrations of American sports in Belgrade and Novi Sad. It is believed that his arrival marked the beginning of volleyball in this area, and in 1924 is considered the year when the first volleyball ball came to Serbia. During the period of occupation, between 1941 and 1944, volleyball was played very actively, numerous competitions were held, and more sports clubs/society's had established its volleyball section. \nThe Serbian/Yugoslav Volleyball Federation was founded in 1946 by the Alliance for Physical Education of Yugoslavia. A year later, in 1947, the International Volleyball Federation (FIVB) was founded and the former Yugoslavia was one of the 14 founders. From 13 February 1949, the Volleyball Federation became an independent sports organization. Two years later, at the European Championships held in Paris, the women's volleyball team of Yugoslavia won the bronze medal for the first time. This success was repeated with the men's event in 1975, when Serbia for the first time in history hosted the biggest European competition, both the men's and women's events. The Serbian team in the last match of the final group defeated Bulgaria in the crowded hall of \"Pioneer\" in Belgrade and won the bronze medal.\n2011 – 2019.\nIn 2011 Serbia became European champion and in 2016 the champion of FIVB World League for the first time, with Marko Ivović being crowned MVP of the tournament and Srećko Lisinac being chosen as the Best Middle Blocker.\n2019 – 2021.\nAfter two bronze medal 2013 and 2017, Serbia become European champion again in 2019 with Uroš Kovačević being crowned MVP of the tournament.\nResults.\nOlympic Games.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nWorld Championship.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nWorld Grand Champions Cup.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nWorld League.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nNations League.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nEuropean Championship.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nEuropean Games.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nMediterranean Games.\n Champions   Runners up   Third place   Fourth place\nTeam.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following is the Serbia roster in the 2023 Men's European Volleyball Championship.\nHead coach: Igor Kolaković\nKit providers.\nThe table below shows the history of kit providers for the Serbia national volleyball team.\nSponsorship.\nPrimary sponsors include: main sponsors like Poštanska štedionica. other sponsors: Škoda Auto, Radio Television of Serbia, Žurnal, Srbijagas, Posta, EPS and Blic."

        "text": "The 1995 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game played on Monday January 2, 1995, because New Year's Day was on a Sunday. It was the 81st Rose Bowl Game. The Penn State Nittany Lions defeated the Oregon Ducks 38–20. Ki-Jana Carter of Penn State and Danny O'Neil of Oregon both were named the Rose Bowl Players of the Game. Many observers point to this game as the one that made Ki-Jana Carter a number one selection in the 1995 NFL Draft.\nTeams.\nBoth teams were appearing in the Rose Bowl after being away for many years. The Oregon Ducks last appeared in the 1958 Rose Bowl, 37 years prior. The Penn State Nittany Lions appeared only one other time, the 1923 Rose Bowl, when the Rose Bowl stadium was used for the game for the first time.\nPenn State Nittany Lions.\nPenn State was playing their second season as the 11th member in the Big Ten Conference. They went undefeated through the Big Ten season and were ranked #2 going into the contest.\nOregon Ducks.\nOregon opened with a win over Portland State, but then lost to non-conference opponents Utah and Hawaii. However, on October 1, 1994, the Ducks pulled off a surprise trouncing of #19 USC, a team that the Ducks had defeated only one other time since 1972. Two weeks after defeating #19 USC the Ducks upset #9 Washington in a game that sparked a period of unprecedented success in the Oregon-Washington rivalry. They would go on to win the rest of their conference games, excepting a week 6 loss to Washington State, including a 10–9 victory over Arizona. The season ended with a 17–13 win over Oregon State with the Rose Bowl on the line. Oregon finished in sole possession of first place, with Arizona and USC tied for second.\nGame summary.\nPenn State running back Ki-Jana Carter provided the highlight of the game when he scored an 83-yard touchdown on Penn State's first offensive play, prompting announcer Keith Jackson to utter, \"They had him, they thought and then he was gone.\" After Carter's touchdown, Oregon came back to tie the game. Penn State scored again and led 14–7 at halftime, but Oregon rode the short passing game of QB Danny O'Neil and kept the ball away from the potent Penn State offense. Oregon tied the game midway through the third quarter. Penn State scored to take a 21–14 and got the ball back. Then came the key play of the game: Penn State safety Chuck Penzenik intercepted O'Neil with just over two minutes left in the third quarter, returning the ball to the Oregon 13-yard line. Carter then scored his third touchdown, a three-yard run that put the Nittany Lions ahead 28–14. Penn State went on to win in comfortable fashion, 38–20.\nAftermath.\nDanny O'Neil contributed to 13 Rose Bowl records including individual records for passes attempted, passes completed, and passing yardage. As of 2008, his records still stood for most offensive plays (74), most passes attempted (61), most passes completed (41), and most yards passing (456).\nKi-Jana Carter was inducted into the Rose Bowl Hall of Fame as a member of the Class of 2014."

Three years ago, he had fallen in love with her during a brief but intense encounter on a railway platform—after which she vanished. Now it seems she is engaged to Richard Fleet, whom she has known since they were children together. And when they were children, Richard's father Sir George died when he fell off the roof of their home, Fleet House. It was generally accepted as an accident, but a series of mysterious happenings cause the case to be re-opened.\nSir Henry Merrivale, detective and explainer of the impossible, is also at the auction and revives his old antagonism with Sophia, Dowager Countess of Brale, who is Jenny's grandmother. Arthur Puckston keeps the pub across the road from Fleet House and was an eyewitness to Sir George's death.\nWhen his daughter, Enid Puckston, is found murdered in what might be a haunted prison, Sir Henry takes a hand and reveals not only the identity of the murderer but the unusual psychology that underlies the case."

He was born Stanislaus Francis Ciolek, was raised in Chicago, and worked in the steel mills.\nA ballplayer in the Chicago semi-pro leagues, often for the Inland Steel Mill team, James Stanley (the name he played under) briefly played for the Danville Speakers of the Three-I League in 1910, hired by Danville's manager Jack McCarthy, an old Chicago baseball player. Stanley was released in May, having played fewer than 10 games. In 1911 he played 3rd base for the Seward Statesmen of the Nebraska State League, batting .244 in 60 games. In 1912 he returned to Chicago, playing 3rd, right field and shortstop for the Chicago Green Sox of the United States Baseball League, batting .252 in 33 games. In 1913 he played the infield for the Chicago Keeleys of the minor league Federal League, batting .256 through the end of August. An injury (a broken bone in his ankle) curtailed his season. In 1914 the Chicago Federals of the major league Federal League signed him to be a utility infielder. The 5-6, 148 pound Stanley, nicknamed \"Honus\" after Hall of Famer Honus Wagner, batted .194 in limited duty. After his major league stint, he played for the Youngstown Steelmen in 1915. In 1916 his old manager, Joe Tinker, signed him to play 3rd base for the Peoria Distillers, though it appears he never played for them. That year he moved to Michigan City, Indiana to work as a crane operator there, and played for his company team. In 1918 he was back in South Chicago (a neighborhood near the old Chicago steel mills) playing semi-pro ball. By 1925 was working for the Michigan City fire department. He is buried in Holy Cross Cemetery, Calumet City, Illinois."

        "text": "The Nebraska Cornhuskers women's basketball team represents the University of Nebraska–Lincoln in the Big Ten Conference of NCAA Division I. The program became a varsity sport in 1975 and has since made fifteen appearances in the NCAA tournament, reaching the Sweet Sixteen twice. NU's longest-tenured head coach was Connie Yori, who led the Cornhuskers to a record-breaking 32–2 season in 2009–10.\nThe team has been coached by former Cornhusker player Amy Williams since 2016.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nNebraska's women's basketball program started as a club sport in 1970 and became a varsity sport five years later. In its first season, George Nicodemus led the team to a 22–9 record and the second round of the AIAW Tournament. NU cycled through five head coaches over the next fifteen years until Angela Beck was hired in 1986. In 1988, Beck led the Huskers to a Big Eight title and their first NCAA Tournament. Nebraska returned to the tournament two other times under Beck until she left the program in 1996. Paul Sanderford was hired to replace Beck and he took the Cornhuskers to the tournament in 1998, 1999, and 2000.\nConnie Yori (2002–16).\nWhen Sanderford resigned due to health concerns following the 2002 season, NU hired Connie Yori from Creighton to lead the program. The Huskers struggled through Yori's first season, finishing 8–20 and last in the Big 12. In Yori's second season, NU improved to 18–12 and was invited to play in the WNIT, the program's first postseason tournament since 2000. Yori coached the Huskers to the best season in school history in 2009–10. Led by national player of the year finalist Kelsey Griffin, Nebraska started 30–0 and finished the regular season ranked No. 3 in the country, the highest ranking in school history. NU ended the year 32–2, reaching the Sweet Sixteen for the first time, and Yori was named national coach of the year. Nebraska joined the Big Ten the following season. Yori's program won the Big Ten tournament in 2014.\nYori resigned in 2016 following an athletic department investigation into reports that she mistreated her players. She left Nebraska as the program's all-time wins leader, coaching two AP All-Americans and twenty-one all-conference selections during her fourteen-year tenure.\nAmy Williams (2016–present).\nFollowing Yori's departure, Nebraska hired Amy Williams to lead the program. Williams, who played at NU from 1994 to 1998, began her head coaching career at NAIA Rogers State, starting the program from scratch. She spent four years at South Dakota, guiding the Coyotes to two Summit League titles, an NCAA Tournament berth, and the 2016 WNIT championship. After a 7–22 debut season at NU, Williams led Nebraska to a 21–11 record in 2017–18. The Cornhuskers tied for third place in the Big Ten and Williams was named the conference's coach of the year.\nPinnacle Bank Arena.\nThe program plays its home games at Pinnacle Bank Arena, a $181 million multi-use facility completed in 2013. The arena, located in Lincoln's Haymarket District, has a listed capacity of 15,500 for basketball games. The team has finished in the top 25 in average home attendance every year since moving to Pinnacle Bank Arena. Prior to the opening of Pinnacle Bank Arena, Nebraska's men's and women's basketball teams played their home games at the Bob Devaney Sports Center."

        "text": "The 1996 Rose Bowl was the 82nd Rose Bowl Game. It was the 50th game in the series featuring the Big Ten Conference and the Pacific-10 Conference. The USC Trojans defeated the Northwestern Wildcats, 41–32, on the strength of two touchdown passes from USC quarterback Brad Otton to wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson. Johnson was named the Rose Bowl Player Of The Game.\nPre-game activities.\nThe game was presided over by the 1996 Tournament of Roses Royal Court and Rose Parade Grand Marshal Kermit the Frog. Members of the court were: Queen Keli Hutchins, San Marino, San Marino High School; Princesses Lissa Anderson, Pasadena, Blair High School; Sarah Clinton, Arcadia, Arcadia High School; Nancy Grace, South Pasadena, Mayfield Senior School; Katherine Kingston, San Marino, San Marino High School; Jennifer Lai, Pasadena, Westridge School for Girls; and Sara Packer, La Canada, La Canada High School.\nTeams.\nNorthwestern Wildcats.\nThe Northwestern Wildcats had a string of losing seasons stretching back to 1972, and had not appeared in the Rose Bowl for 47 years, a win in January 1949. The Wildcats opened the 1995 season with a surprise 17–15 win at #9 Notre Dame on September 3, 1995. That Notre Dame finished at number 6 and went to the Orange Bowl. However, Notre Dame set the record for largest drop in the rankings AP Poll in the Top-25 era when the next AP poll was released, dropping 16 spots to #25 (this record was beaten by Michigan after losing to Appalachian State during the first week of the 2007 season). The Wildcats, who were then ranked in the AP poll for the first time since 1971, fell out of the spotlight when they lost to Miami University in their next game. They won against Air Force and Indiana to get back to #25 in the polls. On October 2, the Wildcats had another win that brought them back into national attention, a 19–13 victory over Michigan in Ann Arbor. The Wildcats won the rest of their games with a perfect 8–0 record in the Big Ten Conference. In response to the Wildcats earning a berth in the Rose Bowl, announcer Keith Jackson uttered the quote \"We've had all the romance; now let's find out if she can dance.\"\nUSC Trojans.\nThe USC Trojans opened with six wins until losing at Notre Dame, 38–10, on October 21. On October 28, USC and Washington played what would be the deciding game for the conference at Husky Stadium. Down 21–0 in the fourth quarter, the Trojans scored three straight touchdowns, with the final coming with 33 seconds remaining. The game ended in a 21–21 tie. A Washington loss to Oregon on November 4 put USC in the lead in the Pac-10 race. Coming into the UCLA–USC rivalry game, the Trojans already had the Rose Bowl berth by virtue of more non-conference victories than Washington, even though a loss to the Bruins would leave both teams with a 6–1–1 record. The Trojans lost to the Bruins, 24–20."

        "text": "Rugby sevens – a short form of the sport of rugby union – was first played in 1883, with the first (men's) internationals taking place in 1973. As women's rugby union developed in the 1960s and 1970s the format became very popular as it allowed games, and entire leagues, to be developed in countries even when player numbers were small, and it remains the main form the women's game is played in most parts of the world.\nHowever, although the first Women's international rugby union 15-a-side test match took place in 1982, it was not until 1997 before the first 7-a-side internationals were played, when the Hong Kong Sevens included a women's tournament for the first time.\nOver the next decade the number of tournaments grew, with almost every region developing regular championship. This reached its zenith with the first Women's Sevens World Cup in 2009, shortly followed by the announcement that women's rugby sevens will be included in the Olympics from 2016. In 2011/12 the IRB organised three official women's challenges tournaments in Dubai, Hong Kong and London. After the success of these events an annual IRB Women's Sevens World Series was launched from the start of the 2012/13 season.\nThe following is a list of all women's international tournaments that have been traced since 1997, listed chronologically with the earliest first, with links to result details, where known. If two tournaments are run concurrently the apparently more senior will be listed first.\nSome tournaments include both club and national teams, and these are only included where the majority of teams are International. Occasionally what are effectively national teams play unofficially under an assumed name – these games are also noted where this is known.\nThe summary section looks at each region in turn and attempts to draw some conclusions about the relative strengths of the participants. This is a little flawed due to the absence of some results and information as well as the inclusion of non-international teams to make up the numbers but should give the best guess available.\n1998.\nCarib International Sevens (Exhibition game).\nYC&amp;AC Invitational Womens Sevens Tournament\nMarch 28nd 1998\nWinners New Zealand\nCompetitors: Japan1 Japan 2, New Zealand, World Invitational team, \n2000.\nHong Kong Sevens.\nYC&amp;AC International Womens Sevens Tournament\nApril 1th 2000\nWinners New Zealand\nCompetitors: Japan, New Zealand, World Invitational team, USA\n2001.\nHong Kong Sevens.\nYC&amp;AC International Womens Sevens Tournament\nApril 7th 2001\nWinners New Zealand\nCompetitors: Japan, New Zealand, World Invitational team, USA\n2005.\nCAR African Sevens.\nCancelled for financial reasons\n2007.\nSouth East Asia Games.\nClassification Stages.\nSemi Finals\n3rd/4th Match (bronze medal)\nFinal (gold and silver medal)\n2008.\nHome Nations Cup 2008.\nAt: Edinburgh 1 June 2008.\n2009.\nReunion Tournament 2009.\nAt: Réunion 20 June 2009\nParticipants: Winners , runners up , third , unknown , \nFrance results:\nEast Asian Games 2009.\nGroup Games\nClassification Stages\nSemi Final\nPlate Final\nFinal\n2010.\nFriendly Cup (Coupe de l'Amitié).\nPool 1 positions\nPool 2 positions\nHungarian results:\nSingapore Sevens.\nGroup A\nPlay-offs\nGroup B\nSemi finals\nPlate Final\nFinal\n2011.\nScrumQueens.com Elite Sevens.\nPool A\nPool B\nSemi-final\nFinal\nLa Réunion Sevens.\nPool A\nPool B\nPlate semi-finals\nPlate final\nSemi-finals\nFinal\nPrague Sevens.\nOnly international fixture: 7–31 \nShanghai Sevens.\nPool\nSemi-finals\nThird place\nFinal\nCastle Sevens.\nPool\nFinal\nFriendly Cup (Coupe de l'Amitié).\nOnly limited details available:\nTorneo Internacional de Elche.\nPool\n3rd/4th\nFinal\nSingapore Cricket Club International Rugby 7s Tournament.\nPool matches\nSemi-Finals\n3rd Place (Plate)\nFinal\nSafaricom Sevens.\nFinal\n2012.\nMartinique Sevens.\nTournoi Guyane-Antilles\nInternational women's tournament:\nSwiss International tournament.\nDay one\nDay two\nAmsterdam Sevens.\nSilver Pier\nWomen's shield\nPrague Sevens.\nOnly international: Austria 19–12 Czech Republic\nPiotrowice Nyskie International Rugby Festival.\nNo international fixtures.

The Cornhuskers have had five individual national champions and 163 total All-Americans.\nThe team has been coached by former all-around national champion Heather Brink since 2019.\nHistory.\nThe team was established in 1975, initially without a head coach. After the program's first season, Nebraska hired Karen Balke to lead a team of entirely freshmen and sophomores. Judy Schalk took over in 1977, leading the Huskers to five conference titles and an AIAW bid in six seasons as head coach. In 1983, Rick Walton was hired as head coach, and under his guidance the program won its first NCAA individual event title, when Michele Bryant came in first place on the vault in 1990. From 1987 to 1990, Walton captured four straight Big Eight titles, taking the Huskers to the NCAA Championships each year, including a program-best fourth-place national finish in 1989.\nAfter the 1993 season, Walton left the program and the Cornhuskers hired Dan Kendig. In his first year, he led NU to a conference championship and was named Big Eight Coach of the Year. In 1997, the Huskers reached the Super Six Finals for the first time under the new NCAA Championship format, beating No. 1 Utah to claim the final spot. Kendig was named national coach of the year in 1999 after winning a sixth consecutive conference title.

        "title": "Peugeot (cycling team)",
        "text": "Peugeot team was a French professional cycling team that promoted and rode Peugeot racing bikes.\nIt is listed as the most successful cycling team of all time on cyclingranking.com, with a large margin on the second placed team, Alcyon.\nHistory.\nPeugeot cycles started producing bicycles in 1882, and from then on it was involved in sponsoring cyclists.\nAt the beginning of the century a Peugeot cycling team existed. Hippolyte Aucouturier rode Peugeot cycles when he won Paris–Roubaix and Bordeaux–Paris in 1903, and when he was disqualified from the 1904 Tour de France in which he had finished fourth overall, for the illegal use of trains and cars.\nBut the Peugeot team obtained success for the following four years in the Tour de France with Louis Trousselier, René Pottier and Lucien Petit-Breton. The Peugeot team finished second overall in the 1912 Giro d'Italia. The team would obtain two further victories in the Tour de France with Belgian Philippe Thys before the outbreak of the First World War.\nDirectly after the war, Peugeot cycles was one of the companies that made a consortium that pooled their resources into a collective cycling team called La Sportive. The objective of forming such a consortium was to keep the sport alive in the poor post-war economic situation.\nAfter three years of the La Sportive consortium, Peugeot re-established its separate cycling team, and with Belgian Firmin Lambot won the 1922 Tour de France. During this time the team was known as the Peugeot team, or sometimes the name of a co-sponsor was added, which occasionally was Wolber, Alcyon, Dunlop, Tedeschi, Bianchi-Pirelli.\nFrom 1936 until 1955 the team was the Peugeot-Dunlop team. Yves Petit-Breton (son of the two time Tour de France winner Lucien Petit-Breton) would be a directeur sportif of the team in 1956.\nFrom 1948 to 1959 there was a Belgian cycling team which was also sponsored by Peugeot, called Elvé-Peugeot.\nIn 1958, Gaston Plaud became the directeur sportif of Peugeot-BP, where he would stay until the mid seventies. He would direct big names to success, such as Charly Gaul, Pino Cerami, Ferdinand Bracke, Walter Godefroot, Tom Simpson, Jean-Pierre Danguillaume, and the early career of Eddy Merckx.\nIn 1963 Team Peugeot adopted the black and white checkerboard design, that would be on their white jersey until the team retired from the sport in 1986. During this time the team achieved many successes, such as Tom Simpson winning Bordeaux–Paris in 1963, Milan–San Remo in 1964, and then in 1965 becoming world champion and winning the Giro di Lombardia.\nEddy Merckx rode his first two seasons with the team, and won Milan–San Remo twice, Gent–Wevelgem, La Flèche Wallonne, a stage in the 1967 Giro d'Italia, and the world championships road race with the team, in 1966. In 1967, the Tour de France was disputed by national teams, and one of Peugeot's riders, Roger Pingeon won the race. He would win the 1969 Vuelta a España for the team. The team won the Vuelta a España again, with Ferdinand Bracke in 1971. The name of the team changed in 1965 to Peugeot-BP Michelin, which it stayed until 1976, when Esso took the place of the second sponsor.\nMaurice De Muer became directeur sportif with the team in 1975, and directed Bernard Thévenet to beat Eddy Merckx, in the 1975 Tour de France. He directed the team until 1982. The last time the team would win the Tour de France would be with Bernard Thévenet, in 1977.\nIn 1982 Shell became the second sponsor, and until its finish the team was Peugeot-Shell-Michelin.\nIn the late seventies and early eighties, the team signed many Anglophone riders. Many of these came from a Parisian Amateur club Athletic Club de Boulogne Billencourt (ACBB) that acted as a feeder club for top amateurs to turn professional. Phil Anderson, Robert Millar, Stephen Roche, Sean Yates, and Allan Peiper all started their careers with the Peugeot team. The last time that the team had the yellow jersey of the Tour was the 1983 Tour de France when Pascal Simon wore the jersey, but had to abandon the Tour, due to a broken collarbone. The team had its last chance at a Grand Tour win in the 1985 edition of the Vuelta a España with Robert Millar. Millar was wearing the leader's red jersey on the penultimate day when Pedro Delgado attacked him, to take the stage and the leader's jersey.\nIn its final year of existence (1986), the team was managed by Roger Legeay. After 1986, Legeay created the Vétements Z-Peugeot team as a continuation of the Peugeot cycling team. Legeay's team was subsequently renamed Z-Peugeot (1988–89), Z-Tomasso (1990), Z (1991–92), GAN (1993–96) and Crédit Agricole (1997–2008), before being disbanded in 2008. Legeay's team is best remembered for being the team which the American cyclist Greg LeMond rode for when he won the Tour de France in 1990 (when the team was known as Z-Tomasso). Other directeur sportifs of the Peugeot cycling team during its existence included: Leon Van der Hulst, Roland Berland, Robert Naeye, Roger Moreau, Jean Lecocq, Camille Narcy, Serge Beucherie, and Jean-François Guiborel."

        "title": "1998 Rose Bowl",
        "text": "The 1998 Rose Bowl was a college football bowl game, part of the 1997–98 college bowl season, played on January 1 at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. The 84th Rose Bowl Game, it featured top-ranked Michigan beating Washington State 21–16, and Wolverine quarterback Brian Griese was named the Rose Bowl Player of the Game. The next Rose Bowl was part of the newly-formed Bowl Championship Series (BCS). This was also the final year that the game was not branded with corporate sponsorship.\nThis was the last time Michigan won the Rose Bowl until 2024, where they defeated the Alabama Crimson Tide 27-20.\nPre-game activities.\nOn Tuesday, October 21, 1997 - Tournament of Roses President Gareth A. Dorn chooses 17-year-old Purdy Tran, a senior at Westridge School &amp; a resident of Arcadia, California, to become the 80th Rose Queen to reign over the 109th Rose Parade and the 84th Rose Bowl Game. Miss Tran is the 1st Vietnamese-American young woman to capture the title in royal court history.\nThe game was presided over by the 1998 Tournament of Roses Royal Court and Rose Parade Grand Marshal Carol Burnett. Members of the royal court are: Princesses Grace Huang, San Marino, San Marino High School; Kristen Kneier, San Marino, San Marino High School; Leslie Marrero, Pasadena, John Muir High School; Lauren Poindexter, La Canada Flintridge, La Canada High School; Amber Ross, Pasadena, Blair High School; and Kate Sargeant, La Canada Flintridge, Blair High School.\nTeams.\nMichigan Wolverines.\nMichigan earned the right to play in the 84th Rose Bowl game by going through the entire regular season undefeated. With a dominating defense led by Heisman Trophy-winning cornerback Charles Woodson and All-American defensive end Glen Steele and a resourceful offense led by quarterback Brian Griese, the Wolverines went 11-0, yielding only 144 points. Lloyd Carr was in his third season as the head coach. They defeated preseason top 5 Colorado, 27-3 in the season opener on September 13. Michigan defeated Notre Dame, 21-14 on September 27. Two-time Big Ten champion Northwestern was a 23-6 victim on October 11. The Iowa game on October 18 was the closest call as the Wolverines trailed 21-7 at halftime before rallying to win 28-24. Michigan stormed into Spartan Stadium on October 25 and subdued the Michigan State Spartans 23-7. On November 8, a day termed \"Judgment Day\", Michigan went on the road and dominated undefeated #3 Penn State 34-8. On November 22, it was #1 (Michigan) vs. #4 (Ohio State) for the right to represent the Big Ten in the Rose Bowl. Thanks to an interception returned for a touchdown and a Charles Woodson 77-yard punt return for a touchdown, Michigan defeated Ohio State 20-14 to finish 11-0, 8-0. The Wolverines entered the Rose Bowl ranked #1 in the AP and coaches' poll. With the 21-16 Rose Bowl win over Washington State, the Wolverines would claim the Associated Press (AP) national championship, as well as the Grantland Rice Award (Football Writers Association of America) and MacArthur Bowl (National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame trophy).\nWashington State Cougars.\nWashington State hadn't played in the Rose Bowl Game since it lost to Alabama in the 1931 edition—a 67-year absence. But the Cougars, led by high-profile quarterback Ryan Leaf, ended that streak mainly to their very first game of the 1997 season.\nIn the opener, the Cougars stormed out to a big lead over the UCLA Bruins and held them off with a goal-line stand in the closing minutes to win 37–34. WSU followed that with a 28–21 win over the USC Trojans, the Cougars' first win in the Los Angeles Coliseum in many years. The Cougars also survived an overtime thriller against the Arizona Wildcats, winning 35–34 when Arizona chose to go for a two-point conversion attempt and failed. WSU's perfect season was ruined in a 44–31 loss at Arizona State, but the Cougars cemented their Rose Bowl bid with a 41–35 victory over the rival Washington Huskies, their first Apple Cup win in Seattle in a dozen years.\nOn New Year's Eve, Cougar head coach Mike Price was bedridden with the flu. While Leaf was their best player (he'd declare himself for the 1998 NFL Draft on January 2), they also received important contributions from their wide receiving corps, better known as the Fab Five: Kevin McKenzie, Shawn McWashington, Shawn Tims, Chris Jackson and Nian Taylor. WSU also had a tremendous running back in Michael Black and a future NFL offensive lineman in Cory Withrow. On the defensive side, linemen Dorian Boose and Leon Bender both became NFL draftees in April, though Bender died in late May. Linebacker Steve Gleason and safety Lamont Thompson also went on to play in the NFL.\nGame summary.\nIn the first quarter, Washington State downed a punt at the 1 and forced a punt without a first down. After regaining possession at the Wolverines 47, Leaf connected with McKenzie on a 15-yard play to take a 7–0 lead with 3:07 remaining. Michigan moved the ball to the Washington State 37 before punting. Leaf marched the Cougars to the Michigan 14, but Woodson intercepted him in the end zone. The teams traded punts before Griese found Streets in stride on the right sideline for a 53-yard touchdown pass to tie the game with 7:08 left in the first half.\nLeaf opened the second half with a 99-yard drive for a go-ahead touchdown to take a 13–7 lead after the extra point was blocked. Key plays on the drive included a 19-yard pass Shawn McWashington and a 30-yard pass Kevin McKenzie to reach the Michigan 38. One play later, Leaf connected with McKenzie for 20 more yards. Then Shawn Tims took a reverse play 14 yards for the score with 8:33 remaining in the third quarter. On the ensuing possession, Michigan mixed four runs by Howard with a pair of short passes to Shaw before Griese found Streets for a 58-yard play-action pass touchdown to take a 14–13 lead with 5:07 left. After a punt by Washington State, Griese led a 14-play 77-yard drive that ended with a Tuman 23-yard play-action touchdown pass with 11:21 to go for a 21–13 lead.\nIn the fourth quarter, Leaf converted a 3rd-and-18 play from his own 12 by connecting with McKenzie for 19 yards. Then a 42-yard pass to DeJuan Gilmore moved the ball to the Michigan 27. Washington State settled for a Rian Lindell 48-yard field goal with 7:25 to play to make the score 21–16. Michigan started a drive that included four consecutive third down conversions and consumed most of the clock. The conversions were as follows: a 3rd-and-11 Griese scramble to the Michigan 29; a 3rd-and-7 lateral to Woodson who faked a pass before running eight yards to keep the drive alive; on 3rd-and-6 a 13-yard pass to Shaw; and a 3rd-and-7 pass to Woodson taking the ball to the Washington State 33. A pooch punt by Feely from field goal formation left Washington State on its own 7-yard-line with 29 seconds remaining. The game ended in confusion with Leaf being deemed too late in an attempt to spike the ball to stop the clock for a last play. The drive began at the Cougar 7-yard-line with 16 seconds left to play. Leaf completed a 46-yard pass to Nian Taylor to move the ball to the Michigan 47. Washington State drew an illegal formation penalty with nine seconds remaining, but executed a hook and lateral play for 26 yards to the Michigan 26, with an 8-yard catch by Love Jefferson and an 18-yard run by Jason Clayton, who was tackled by Weathers and Jones. With two seconds to play, the clock was stopped to move the chains. With no timeouts left, Leaf spiked the football, but although there appeared to be one second remaining on the clock, Dick Burleson, the referee from the Southeastern Conference crew, shook his head as Leaf contested the decision. Michigan's victory evened the series between the Pac-10 and Big Ten in the Rose Bowl at 26 wins apiece.\nAftermath.\nThe next year, the Rose Bowl game would become part of the Bowl Championship Series. This would give a greater chance of the number one and number two teams meeting. Michigan was named the college football national champion for the 1997 football season in the AP poll. In the coaches poll, undefeated Nebraska (which defeated #3 Tennessee 42–17 in the Orange Bowl) was voted #1; Michigan had entered the Rose Bowl first in both polls, and were favored to beat the Cougars by seven points. Michigan would not win the national championship again until 2023.\nThis was the last Rose Bowl game with an attendance of over 100,000. The stadium was modified following the game to widen the playing field for soccer in preparation for the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup and remove lower seats that were blocked by players on the sidelines."

A total of 5700 examples of the type have been completed.\nDesign.\nThe Windmill is a recreational sailboat, built predominantly of plywood or fiberglass in the form of a double hull with a foam core, resulting in an unsinkable boat. It has a fractional sloop rig with aluminum spars. The boat and is sailed only with a jib and mainsail, no spinnaker and no trapeze. The hull has a rounded plumb stem, a conventional transom, a transom-hung rudder controlled by a tiller and a retractable daggerboard. It displaces ,\nThe boat has a draft of with the daggerboard extended and with it retracted, allowing beaching or ground transportation on a trailer or car roof rack.\nFor sailing the design is equipped with jib and mainsail windows for visibility. It also has an internal 2:1 mechanical advantage outhaul, a 4:1 boom vang controlled by the boat's skipper and a 4:1 Cunningham. The boat has adjustable jib fairleads and a mainsheet traveler, plus an Elvstrom bailer.\nThe design has a Portsmouth Yardstick racing average handicap of 90.2 and is normally raced with a crew of two sailors.\nOperational history.\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \"the Windmill is a high-performance sloop that can be built from plans or from a kit, or purchased complete. She is very light and planes quickly. Class rules are strict, and neither spinnakers nor trapezes are allowed. With a double hull and closed-cell foam, the boat is unsinkable. This type of construction also results in a very rigid boat.\"\nThe boat is supported by an active class club, the Windmill Class Association.\nSee also.\nRelated development"
