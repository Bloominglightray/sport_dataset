        "text": "The Basketball Bundesliga (BBL) (English language: \"Federal Basketball League\"), for sponsorship reasons named easyCredit BBL, is the highest level league of professional club basketball in Germany. The league comprises 18 teams. A BBL season is split into a league stage and a playoff stage. At the end of the league stage, the top eight teams qualify for the playoff stage, and the teams positioned in the 17th and 18th places are relegated to a lower-tier league. The playoffs are played in a \"Best of five\" format. The winning team of the final round are crowned the German Champions of that season.\nIn addition to the league competition, all BBL teams compete for the German Basketball Cup. Teams playing in the second league (ProA or ProB), or in a lower level Regionalliga, are also eligible to participate in the BBL-Cup. There are always 3 knock-out rounds that are played for the BBL-Cup. If more teams from the leagues below the BBL level apply for participation, then available places, and additional qualification rounds are added for them. The final four remaining teams determine the rankings for bronze, silver, and gold medals, in knock-out matches that are termed the BBL-TOP4. The gold winning team is the German Basketball Cup winner.\nThe Basketball Bundesliga is run by the Basketball Bundesliga GmbH. 74% of BBL GmbH is owned by the AG BBL e.V. (which is composed of the clubs), and 26% by the German Basketball Federation (DBB).\nHistory.\nIn Germany, a national domestic basketball championship was first organised in 1939, and it was won by \"LSV Spandau\". By 1944, almost all basketball activity in the country was forced to an end, due to the Second World War. In 1947, \"MTSV Schwabing München\" became the first champion of post-war divided Germany.\nThe creation of a split West German federal-league, consisting of one northern division and one southern division, each comprising 10 teams, was decided on by the German Basketball Federation (DBB) in 1964. On October 1, 1966, the first season of the so-called Basketball Bundesliga started. Starting with the 1971–72 season, the size of each division was reduced to 8 teams.\nWith the 1975–76 season, the league structure was changed into a ten team first league (1. Basketball Bundesliga), and a 20 team second league (2. Basketball Bundesliga). Only the second league was split into a northern and a southern division, of 10 teams each. In 1985, the top league was enlarged to a size of 12 teams, and two years later, each division of the second league was also enlarged to 12 teams.\nIn 1988, the championship mode \"Best of five\" was applied for the first time. Starting with the 1995–96 season, the first league consisted of 14 teams. The Basketball Bundesliga GmbH (BBL) was founded in October 1996.\nThe federal leagues received their own administration within the framework of the German Basketball Federation in 1997. Since then, the second league divisions have been administered by the \"AG 2. Bundesliga\", while the BBL has been responsible for the first league. Two years later, a contract was signed between the BBL and the German Basketball Federation, in which the federation transferred its marketing/events rights to the BBL, for a 10-year duration, and in return, the BBL agreed to pay an annual \"amateur support fee\" of DM 600,000 (€ 306,775).\nStarting with the 2003–04 season, the top league was increased to 16 teams, and in 2006–07, it was further increased to its present size of 18 teams. For the following 2007–08 season, the structure of the second league was reshaped from its northern/southern divisions, into a ProA division, and a ProB division. These divisions remained under the administration by \"AG 2. Bundesliga\".\nBetween 1994 and 2001, the highest level German basketball league was called \"Veltins Basketball Bundesliga\", and from 2001, until 2003, the league was known as \"s.Oliver Basketball Bundesliga\". Bayer Giants Leverkusen hold the league titles won record, being the winner of 14 German Basketball Championships. However, since 1997, Alba Berlin has dominated the league, winning their 8th title in 2008. Twenty-one teams have won the championship, since its inception.\nSince 2009, Brose Bamberg dominated the competition and won the title in four straight seasons (2009-2013).\nSponsorship.\nIn 2016, the BBL joined forces with Tipbet, a Malta-based betting company. This made Tipbet the Official Betting and Premium Sponsor of the league; the sponsorship agreement results in advertising activities throughout the arenas and online, and runs until 2018.\nArena rules.\nCurrently, all Bundesliga clubs must play in arenas that seat at least 3,000 people.\nClubs.\nMembers of the 2022–23 Basketball Bundesliga."

        "text": "Douglas Howard “Doug” Henry (born September 6, 1969) is an American former professional motocross racer. He competed in the AMA Motocross Championships from 1988 to 2006. He is a three-time AMA motocross national champion. Henry was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 2005.\nEarly career.\nHenry was born in Milford, Connecticut and grew up on his parents' farm in the White Hills section of Shelton, CT. The rural area with extensive winding dirt roads was conducive to him learning the sport he would master. He attended Shelton High School. Henry had his first major success in 1993 as a member of Team Honda, where he claimed the 125 East Supercross and the 125 National Championship. In 1994, he repeated as champion in the nationals, beating riders such as Steve Lamson and Ryan Hughes while battling a severe stomach ailment. He later appeared on Fox's first motocross movie Terrafirma. He moved to the premier 250cc division for 1995, where he was immediately competitive, winning Supercross mains and outdoor overalls, before a devastating injury at Budds Creek, Maryland ended his season. Henry was slipping off the back of the bike on the face of a hill, inadvertently applying full throttle, launching him off the hill, causing him to fall from nearly 80 feet in the air to flat ground. Henry's back was broken, but he did not become paralyzed. Henry raced Southwick every year to earn national points and keep his trademark national #19. He regularly finished in the top-5 on privateer Yamahas.\nComeback.\nHenry fought back and wanted to race again. He slowly worked his way back into shape, and Team Yamaha took a chance on him for the 1996 season. By the end of the Nationals, Henry was winning motos once again and had regained his form. For 1997, Yamaha approached Henry with the idea of riding their prototype YZM400 four-stroke in competition. He accepted the offer. While he raced and led the early part of the 1997 Supercross season on a YZ250, Henry complications from a hand injury forced him to withdraw during the middle of the series. He came back riding the four-stroke full-time, and posted top-5 finishes at the first few Nationals, which was unprecedented for a four-stroke machine. Henry raced the bike at the final Supercross in Las Vegas, Nevada, and won the race in the prototype bike's first and only start. Tragedy would strike Henry yet again that summer, as he suffered two broken wrists at Budds Creek, mere feet away from the jump where he had his earlier injury. But Henry would battle back again.\nHenry would race the production version of the prototype four-stroke, the YZ400F, for 1998. This machine started the four-stroke revolution in motocross. He battled through a strong but unspectacular supercross season where he finished 7th overall. The outdoor season would be Henry's chance to show the bike's true capabilities. After a win at his home track of Southwick, Henry followed up with a triumphant win in Budds Creek, the track where he broke his arms and back. He would go on to defeat Jeff Emig, Jeremy McGrath, Ezra Lusk, Kevin Windham, Mickael Pichon, and Greg Albertyn, earning five overall wins in one of the most competitive seasons ever to take the 1998 250cc National Championship at Broome Tioga Sports Center. He accomplished this with one whole round left.\nHaving accomplished all his goals, Henry scaled back to a partial schedule for 1999, where he dabbled in snocross for the winter. He returned to the nationals in a farewell tour wearing his #1 plate. He started slowly after taking the winter off, but still managed to score overall wins by mid-season. Henry had been a regular on the AMA Supermoto tour, winning many National events. He gained national attention once again by winning the gold medal in the 2005 X-Games Supermoto race. Henry also won a 2005 Grand National Cross Country enduro race in his first attempt on a stock Honda 450. He followed that with a bronze in 2006.\nSemi-retirement and subsequent injury.\nHenry broke his back on March 4, 2007, in a Supermoto race. He now has partial paralysis from the waist down, and is working very hard toward yet another recovery.\nHenry was filmed on September 14, 2009, riding a custom YZ450F and a custom FX Nytro during winter. Henry raced at Winter X-Games 14, in the \"Adaptive Snowmobile\" class. He took third place."

Chasing 244 under lights, India got off to a steady start losing their first wicket in the 6th over with 23 runs on the board.

At that time it was known as the Caribbean and Central American Zone. The development of the NORCECA Confederation came from the visionary mind of today’s FIVB President, Dr. Rubén Acosta Hernández, in conjunction with several other sportsmen from Puerto Rico, Cuba, Dominican Republic and Haiti. NORCECA was formally created by the FIVB and its President, Mr. Paul Liband in 1968, when Canada and the United States of America joined the confederation. Its first Senior Championship was held in Mexico from August 4–9, 1969 and the inaugural game featured Haiti vs. Panama, with Haiti winning 3-0.

The supervising body is the Basketball Federation of Montenegro.\nMontenegro joined FIBA in 2006, following the restoration of Montenegrin independence in the same year. Since 2006, the national team has qualified for EuroBasket on four occasions (2011, 2013, 2017, 2022). Montenegro has qualified for the FIBA World Cup twice, in 2019 and 2023. The team has also taken part in smaller tournaments such as the Games of the Small States of Europe.\nHistory.\n2006–2014.\nIn 2006, the Basketball Federation of Montenegro along with this team joined the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) on its own following the Independence of Montenegro.\nThe Montenegrin national team entered international competition in 2008, and appointed Duško Vujošević as the national coach. Montenegro started from FIBA Division B, where they won first place in their first competitive season. Since becoming a separate team, Montenegro has won 13 official games in a row, until losing to Israel in August 2010.\nAt that time, NBA players like Nikola Vučević and Nikola Peković became the most known players of Montenegrin national team.\nIn their first qualifiers for EuroBasket, Montenegro finished first in the group. So, the team qualified for Eurobasket 2011, where they played five games in the first phase – with one win and four losses. The Coach of Montenegro at their first-ever EuroBasket was Dejan Radonjić.\nIn August 2012, with the new coach Luka Pavićević, Montenegro started qualifiers for Eurobasket 2013. Again, they won first place, but without any defeat from 10 matches. Notable matches were against Serbia, first after the two countries separated. Montenegro won both games, and victory in Belgrade (73:71), in front of 18,000 spectators, is gained by Nikola Ivanović three-point shot from the center, one second before the end of the match.\nAs the first-place team in qualifiers, Montenegro participated at Eurobasket 2013 in Slovenia. They made better results than 2011, with two wins and three defeats, but that was not enough for the second phase of EuroBasket.\nFirst unsuccessful qualifying campaign since independence, Montenegro had during the 2014. Surprisingly, group stage at the EuroBasket 2015 qualification, Montenegro finished third, so they failed to qualify for the final tournament.\n2015–present.\nIn 2015, Montenegro named Bogdan Tanjević new head coach of the national team. Prior to taking the reins of the national team, he was the head coach of Fenerbahçe. As the national team earlier failed to qualify for EuroBasket 2015, they participated in the Games of the Small States of Europe (European countries with less than a million citizens) in Iceland and easily won the gold medal.\nIn summer 2016, Montenegro started competition in EuroBasket 2017 qualifiers, with the only ambition to qualify for their third final tournament since independence. In a group with Georgia, Slovakia and Albania, Montenegro finished as a second-place team, with one defeat, and qualified for EuroBasket 2017.\nFor the first time in their history, in Eurobasket 2017, Montenegro finished as a third-place team in the group stage and qualified to the knockout stage. At that time, that was the biggest success of the Montenegrin national team since its independence in 2006. Two years later, Montenegro qualified for the 2019 FIBA World Cup for the first time, after a winner-take-all game in Podgorica against Latvia. Montenegro lost the game 80–74 but still went through as they had won the away game 84–75, thus holding the tiebreaker on points difference. With that result, Montenegro became the smallest state by population and territory to qualify for the FIBA World Cup since the establishing of competition.\nCompetitive record.\nMontenegro made their first appearance at the FIBA World Cup in 2019. The national team has also appeared four times at the EuroBasket (2011, 2013, 2017, 2022).

The first head coach of Montenegro was Duško Vujošević. With him, Montenegro won the FIBA B division championship (2009). From 2010 to 2012, Montenegro was coached by Dejan Radonjić, who led the national team to their first EuroBasket (2011). At their next Eurobasket participation (2013), Montenegro was led by Luka Pavićević. From 2015 to 2017, the head coach of Montenegro was Bogdan Tanjević, who led Montenegro to their first-ever Second phase games at the Eurobasket (2016). After that tournament, the Basketball Federation of Montenegro named Zvezdan Mitrović new head coach of the national team.

The team made its international debut in 2006 and qualified for the 2008 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier, but has played no international matches since 2012.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nWomen's cricket in Bermuda dates to the late 1930s, when Black Bermudian women excluded from white establishments like tennis clubs established a social cricket competition. In 1943 a cup was donated, but the women's cricket scene later declined. The sport underwent a revival in the 1970s due to sponsorship from local hotels, who sponsored teams made up of their employees.\nEstablishment of national team.\nA women's national squad was established by the Bermuda Cricket Board (BCB) in April 2006. The team made its international debut against Canada in September 2006, playing a three-match 50-over series for the right to represent the ICC Americas region at the 2008 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier. Captained by Terry-Lynn Paynter, Bermuda lost the first match by five wickets but rebounded to win the second game by 24 runs and the third by three runs to clinch qualification for the World Cup QUalifier.\nAt the 2008 World Cup Qualifier in South Africa, Bermuda lost all five of its matches by heavy margins. Against South Africa, Bermuda was dismissed for only 13 runs from 18 overs. Only three batters managed to score, with team captain Linda Mienzer recording one run from 48 deliveries faced, and extras accounting for ten runs. In response, South Africa took only four balls to record a ten-wicket victory.\nBermuda played five matches at the 2012 ICC America's Women's T20 Championship in Cayman Islands, winning only against Brazil. Their match against Cayman Islands was washed out.\nDisbandment, T20I status and revival.\nBy 2015, the national women's squad had been disbanded with efforts underway to re-establish a senior women's league.\nIn April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Bermuda women and other ICC members after 1 July 2018 have the full WT20I status.\nIn 2021, the Bermuda Cricket Board (BCB) established a women's cricket development program with three club teams. The BCB announced in 2022 that it had secured sponsorship for the women's team from an insurance firm, as part of its five-year strategic plan. A national women's twenty20 league with at least four clubs was announced in 2023, one of the preconditions for Bermuda to receive invitations to ICC tournaments."

They now compete on an annual basis in the Africa Cup. Rugby union in Zambia is administered by the Zambian Rugby Union. It was founded by Ian Kirkpatrick, formerly of the All Blacks, in the 1960's. Prior to 1964 Rugby was administered under the combined Rhodesian Rugby Union which included present day Zimbabwe and was affiliated to the South African Rugby Union with Rhodesia having the equivalent status of a provincial team in the South African provincial competitions. \nZambia competes in the Africa Rugby Cup. Zambia also competes in qualifying for the Rugby World Cup, although they have yet to qualify for the tournament.\nWorld Cup Record.\nZambia were not invited to the original world cup in 1987 in New Zealand. They did not enter the first two tournaments that were open to qualification in 1991 and 1995. They first attempted to qualify for the 1999 Rugby World Cup. Between then and RWC 2011 qualification attempts have been very unsuccessful, with elimination coming in the 1st Round every time. The most successful attempt was for the RWC 2007 where they got through their group as winners only to be beaten by Senegal in a playoff for a place in Round 2.\nYear-by-Year Record.\nRound 1a: Southern Pool\nRound 1a: Playoff"

The team made its international debut in 2006, although Cricket Canada has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1968. Canada is one of the leading associate members in the ICC Americas region. The team is yet to qualify for any ICC global events but did reach the 2013 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier.\nHistory.\nCanada made their international debut in September 2006 in a three match series of one-day games against Bermuda to decide which team would represent the Americas region in the Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier in Ireland in 2007. Canada started well, with a five wicket win in the first win - Game 1, but Bermuda came back with 24 run win in the second - Game 2. The third game went down to the wire, with Bermuda triumphing by just 3 runs - Game 3.\nIn 2007 Canada won the inaugural ICC Americas Championship held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They recorded victories over Argentina and Bermuda. They also played an exhibition game against Trinidad and Tobago under-17s.\nIn 2009 Canada successfully defended the ICC Americas Championship in Florida, United States, with wins in the T20 portion of the competition over Argentina and Bermuda. Following this, they defeated the United States and had a washout versus Argentina which left them atop the points table.\nIn 2010 a regional qualifier was held in Toronto Canada between Canada and the United States. Canada lost all three 50 over matches, Game 1, Game 2, Game 3 resulting in the United States qualifying for the World Cup qualifier held in Bangladesh 2011. Canada did however win both T20 games held following the qualifier, Game 1 and Game 2.\nIn 2012 the ICC Americas T20 Women's Championship was held in the Cayman Islands. Canada registered wins over Brazil, Bermuda, Cayman Islands, and Argentina. The final match versus the United States was a washout, resulting in Canada winning the tournament with a superior net run rate.\nIn April 2018, the International Cricket Council (ICC) granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Canada women and another international side since 1 July 2018 have the full WT20I status.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. Canada were named in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier regional group, alongside three other teams.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Canada Women\n\"Last updated 11 September 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to WT20I #1660.

        "text": "John W. Ray (June 4, 1926 – November 14, 2007) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head football coach at John Carroll University from 1959 to 1963 and at the University of Kentucky from 1969 to 1972, compiling a career college football record of 39–39.\nRay was a native of Detroit, Michigan and grew up in South Bend, Indiana. He played football at Notre Dame and at Olivet College. After graduating Ray was the head football coach at Sturgis High School and Three Rivers High School, both in Michigan, and then was an assistant coach at the University of Detroit and head coach at John Carroll University from 1959 to 1963.\nFrom 1964 to 1968 Ray served as an assistant coach and defensive coordinator at Notre Dame under Ara Parseghian. He oversaw a 4-4-3 defense that gave up a measly 3.8 points a game in 1966, leading Notre Dame to an undefeated national championship that season.\nRay became the head coach at the University of Kentucky in late 1968, replacing Charlie Bradshaw. In his second game, Kentucky upset quarterback Archie Manning's highly regarded Ole Miss team, which was ranked No. 8 in the AP Poll, by a score of 10–9. Ray also coached the Wildcats to a 16–3 win over No. 13 Kansas State in 1970. The Wildcats also lost close games to ranked teams, such as No. 9 Tennessee (31–26 in 1969), at #5 Ole Miss (20–17, 1970), at No. 15 LSU (14–7, 1970) and No. 12 LSU (17–13, 1971). However, Ray's teams played very solid defense but consistently lacked the players to play well on both sides of the ball. Over his four years as head coach, Kentucky won only 10 games while losing 33. In 1969 Kentucky finished 2–8; in 1970, 2–9; in 1971 and 1972 the Wildcats' final record was 3–8 each season. Ray's contract was not renewed after the 1972 season and he was replaced by Fran Curci.\nDuring Ray's tenure, Kentucky's recruitment of African-American players increased, notably with star running back Sonny Collins. Ray brought more African-American players to Kentucky than any previous coach, and did so at a time when African-American players were rare in the Southeastern Conference. Also during Ray's tenure plans were made and construction undertaken for Commonwealth Stadium, the current home of the Wildcats. While at Kentucky Ray coached future NFL players such as Dave Roller and Joe Federspiel.\nAfter leaving Kentucky Ray was an assistant coach in the NFL including as defensive coordinator for the Buffalo Bills.\nRay died at his home in Granger, Indiana at age 81 on November 14, 2007."

The owners of Kelme were not satisfied with the publicity that this produced, so they decided to sponsor a cycling team instead.\nThe Kelme team was formed from another Spanish cycling team, Transmallorca, in 1980. From the 2004 cycling season, the Valencian government took the main sponsorship, Kelme becoming co-sponsor, finally dropping from the team at the end of the year. Despite this, the team kept on running, but its days were numbered when on 20 August 2006, because of doping allegations on Operación Puerto, the Valencian government dropped its sponsorship. This was to become the last year for the oldest team in the peloton. The last couple of years, it was managed by Vicente Belda, a former cyclist who rode for the team from 1980 to 1988. Famous former riders included Alejandro Valverde, Roberto Heras, Aitor González, Óscar Sevilla, Ángel Casero, and Fernando Escartín. The team's major results include two wins in the Vuelta a España: by Roberto Heras in 2000 and Aitor González in 2002.\nDoping controversy.\nIn March 2004, in an interview with the Spanish newspaper \"AS\", the former Kelme cyclist Jesús Manzano exposed the systematic doping in the team. During the interview he detailed blood doping as well as the various performance-enhancing drugs he used while on the team. Immediately the Kelme team denied the allegations, and Jean-Marie Leblanc, the director of the Tour de France, was also sceptical about the allegations. After more detailed revelations, the Kelme team who had been invited to the 2004 Tour de France had their invitation withdrawn.\nThe subsequent investigation into Manzano's doping activities and the allegations he made led to the questioning of several members of the Kelme team in April 2004. These included Eufemiano Fuentes, who was at that time the Kelme team doctor; Walter Virú, the previous team doctor; and Alfredo Córdova, who was working for Liberty Seguros but had been involved with Kelme in 2003.\nAn investigation began into the practises of Fuentes in early 2006 by Central Operating Unit, the anti-drug trafficking arm of the Spanish Guardia Civil. In May 2006, several arrests were made. Manzano's statements had led directly to the development of this investigation.\nIn June 2007 Manzano claimed that Alejandro Valverde doped with testosterone during the 2002 Vuelta a España."

        "title": "Robert Dover (equestrian)",
        "text": "Robert Jeffrey Dover (born June 7, 1956) is an American equestrian who has had international success in the sport of dressage. Riding from the age of 13, he began specializing in dressage at age 19 and competed in his first Olympics in 1984. He competed in every summer Games between 1984 and 2004, winning four team bronze medals. He also took a team bronze at the 1994 World Equestrian Games. Dover is the most honored dressage rider in the United States, and has been inducted to the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame. Outside of competition, Dover founded the Equestrian Aid Foundation in 1996 to assist others in the equestrian world, and hosted a TV show that searched for the next dressage star. From late 2009 to early 2011, Dover served as the Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian national dressage team. In April 2013, Dover was named Technical Advisor/Chef d'Equipe for the US national dressage team.\nPersonal life.\nDover, who is Jewish, was born in Chicago, Illinois to parents Herb and Jean Dover. He was given a horse for his Bar Mitzvah at 13 and was active in Pony Club, graduating at \"A\" level, the highest level. He decided to specialize in dressage when he was 19. Dover attended the University of Georgia. He is openly gay, and his partner is fellow rider Robert Ross. He became the first openly gay Olympic athlete when he came out in 1988. Injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and pinched sciatic nerve, began to plague him in the late 1990s, causing major back pain and reducing his ability to ride.\nCareer.\nCompetition.\nIn 1984, Dover competed in his first Olympic Games at the age of 28. At the Los Angeles Games, he finished 17th individually, and the US team finished 6th. At the 1988 Seoul Olympics, he finished 13th, and the team tied for 6th place. In 1992, at the Barcelona Games, Dover tied for 22nd place, while the American team took the bronze medal. At the 1996 Atlanta Games, the 2000 Sydney Olympics and the 2004 Athina Games the United States dressage team took the bronze medal each time, while Dover finished 25th, 23rd and 6th respectively. He was elected team captain in all six Olympics in which he competed. Of his Olympic experience, Dover says, \"The medals themselves aren't the important thing. My memories of the Games and of the entire Olympic experience are, to me, everything.\"\nIn 1987, Dover defeated Reiner Klimke, a six-time Olympic gold medalist, at the German Aachen Grand Prix freestyle competition. In doing so, he became the first American in 27 years to win that event. In 1994 he was named the US Olympic Male Equestrian Athlete of the Year, and in 1995 awarded the Whitney Stone Cup, given by the United States Equestrian Federation (USEF) for excellence in international competition. Dover has been named the USEF Dressage Champion five times, and ridden seven times in the FEI World Cup Final. In 1994, Dover rode with the United States dressage team at the World Equestrian Games, winning a team bronze. He was also amassed more than 100 Grand Prix victories. Overall, Dover has won more honors in dressage than any other rider from the United States. In 2009, Dover announced his retirement from competitive riding, instead choosing to focus on teaching and philanthropy.\nOther.\nDover founded the Equestrian Aid Foundation in 1996. The Foundation's mission is to financially assist members of the equestrian community who have suffered a catastrophic accident, injury or illness. In 2002, Dover was listed as one of the 50 most influential horsemen by \"Chronicle of the Horse\" magazine. In 2007, \"The Search for America's Next Equestrian Star: Dressage\", a reality TV show created and promoted by Dover, aired on the Fox Reality Channel with five one-hour episodes. The show followed a search for young, talented dressage riders, with the final five being allowed to train with Dover for one month before a winner was selected; the winner became Dover's assistant. In 2008, Dover was inducted into the United States Dressage Federation Hall of Fame. Dover served on the USEF Dressage Committee for many years, and spent eight years on the US Olympic Committee Athlete Advisory Council.\nIn late 2009, Dover was selected as a Technical/Coach Advisor for the Canadian dressage team, with a contract that extended through the 2010 World Equestrian Games in Lexington, Kentucky. After the Games, it was announced that Dover and the Canadian team had not been able to agree on contract renewal terms, but in late 2010 it was announced that Dover would remain as the interim trainer for the first quarter of 2011. In March 2011, German equestrian Markus Gribbe was hired, and Dover's term as a Canadian coach came to an end. Dover is known for his coaching abilities, with some of the best dressage riders with top international titles to their credit coming from his stables. During his time as a trainer for Canada, he was no longer be eligible to train top riders with the USEF. In April 2013, Dover was named Technical Advisor/Chef d'Equipe of the US national dressage team. He is expected to remain in the position through the 2016 Summer Olympics. Dover is currently a rider and trainer at Stillpoint Farm in Florida."

        "text": "The World Para Alpine Skiing World Cup (previously called the IPC Alpine Skiing World Cup) is an annual circuit of elite disabled alpine skiing competitions, regulated by the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) and the International Ski Federation (FIS).\nHeld at ski areas across Europe, North America, and East Asia, the World Cup consists of timed races in five disciplines: slalom, giant slalom, super G, downhill, and super combined. Medals are awarded to the top three men's and women's finishers in each of the three disability categories: standing, sitting, and visually impaired. After each race, points are awarded to the top 30 skiers in each disability category who finish within a certain percentage of the winning time. 100 points are awarded to the winner, 80 for second place, 60 for third, and so on, down to one point for 30th place. In each disability category, the male and female athlete with the most points at the end of the season wins the overall World Cup title and a large glass trophy, the \"crystal globe\". Smaller globes are also awarded for athletes with the highest point totals in each of the five disciplines. Additionally, a \"Nations Cup\" trophy is awarded to the country that accumulates the highest point total.\nThe World Cup is held every year, and is considered one of the premier competitions in disabled ski racing, along with the Winter Paralympics (held every four years, concurrently with the Winter Olympics) and the World Championships (held every two years since 2009, but irregularly before that). \nDisabled ski racers who aspire one day to compete on the World Cup attempt to qualify on one of the \"Continental Cup\" circuits: the \"Europa Cup\" (or \"European Cup\") in Europe and the \"Nor-Am Cup\" in North America.\nHistory.\nAlthough disabled ski competitions date to the mid-20th century and the first Winter Paralympics were held in 1976, the Disabled Alpine World Cup is relatively new. An unofficial circuit began in the late 1990s, and the first FIS-sanctioned World Cup race was held in Breckenridge, Colorado, United States in December 1999, with the first World Cup titles awarded in the spring of 2000. In 2004, the administration of the World Cup circuit, and disabled ski racing in general, passed from the FIS to the IPC, although the FIS is still involved in some aspects of the tour. For example, a FIS technical delegate still oversees each race."

The competition has been held since 2000 and was incorporated into the Festival of World Cups in 2008 until 2017 when it became a centrepiece event along with the men's competition. Under the current format, eight teams are separated into two groups of four with the top two in each group qualifying for the semi-finals.\nThroughout the six editions, the Women's Rugby League World Cup has been won by two teams. New Zealand has won three times while Australia has also won the title three times, including the most recent one (2021).\nHistory.\nBackground.\nWomen's Rugby League had been played in both Oceania and the United Kingdom for several years but it was not until 1985 in Britain and 1993 in Australia and New Zealand where female only organizations and governing bodies were established and while the Rugby Football League recognized the British women in 1985 it took another five years for the Australian Rugby League to officially recognize the Australian Women's Rugby League. New Zealand Women's Rugby League were officially recognized by the governing body New Zealand Rugby League Inc in 1995. This is partially the reason for no Women's World Cup being held until the year 2000 when these organizations collectively came together to organize it.\nTournaments.\nThe 2000 World Cup was held in England. The final was contested between Great Britain and New Zealand with New Zealand being crowned champions by a score of 26–4.\nThe 2003 World Cup was held in Albany, New Zealand and was contested by teams from Australia, Great Britain, Tokelau, Tonga, Cook Islands, Niue, Samoa, New Zealand Māori and New Zealand.

New Zealand went through the tournament unbeaten with only four points scored against them.\nThe 2008 World Cup was held was held in Australia, with all matches at Sunshine Coast Stadium apart from the final, which was held at Lang Park in Brisbane. Teams from Australia, New Zealand, England, Samoa, Tonga, Pacific Islands, France and Russia participated in the tournament. This was the first tournament in which Great Britain didn't participate, their place being taken by England. It was also the first tournament to feature more than one team from Europe with France and Russia. To date, this is the only tournament that Russia has participated in. New Zealand won the 2008 World Cup defeating Australia 34–0 in the final. Up to this point, New Zealand had won all three world cups that had been held.\nThe 2013 World Cup was held in England with all four venues being in the county of West Yorkshire. For the tournament, the number of teams was reduced from eight to just four with Australia, New Zealand, England and France taking part. France performed particularly poorly in the competition, conceding 202 points in their three games and scoring just 4. The final was held at Headingley Stadium, Leeds and was contested by Australia and New Zealand. Australia won by a score of 22–12 to win their first world cup.\nThe 2017 World Cup was held in Australia, with all matches at Endeavour Field in Cronulla, New South Wales apart from the final, which was held at Lang Park in Brisbane, Queensland. The number of teams was increased from the previous tournament to 6. Despite taking part in the previous two tournaments, France did not feature, making England the sole representative of Europe. For the first time in the tournament's history, Canada would take part thus becoming the first team from North America to feature. Canada performed well, beating Papua New Guinea and reaching the semi-finals, eventually losing 58–6 to Australia. For the first time, the final was held as a double-header with the men's World Cup final with Australia defending their title by beating New Zealand by a score of 23–16.\nOn 18 July 2019, the teams for the 2021 World Cup were announced with the tournament being expanded once again to eight teams. The tournament was played alongside the men's and wheelchair competitions and took place in England. Teams from England, France, Australia, New Zealand, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, Canada and Brazil took part. For the first time, teams from four different continents will play in the competition. The inclusion of Brazil means a team from South America will take part in for the first time in any Rugby League World Cup. For the first time, all matches of the tournament would be broadcast live.\nIn May 2023, France withdrew as the host of the 2025 World Cup. As a result, in August, it was announced the tournament would be postponed until 2026. During this announcement, International Rugby League stated that 2026 will be the last World Cup that is held alongside the men's tournament, and starting in 2028 the women's tournament would be its own event.\nFormat.\nIn 2000 three teams participated. There had been an intention that New Zealand Maori would participate as a fourth team, however this did not happen. In 2003 nine teams participated, initially in three groups of three. The top two teams in each pool progressed to a second phase, with the six teams divided into two pools. The bottom three teams from the first phase played a round-robin of consolation matches. After the second phase, the top two teams from each second phase pool entered the semi-finals.\nIn 2008, the eight teams was split into two groups of four with the top two of each group progressing through semi-final and final rounds. The 2013 tournament saw a change in the format with the reductions of teams to four meant that there was only one group with the top two qualifying for the final. The following edition saw the return to a two-group format with the six teams being separated in two groups of three with an inter-group game so that they have still played three games as in previous tournaments. The semi-final round will be brought back for this tournament with the bottom team of each group being eliminated at the first stage.\nResults.\nSummary.\nAustralia and New Zealand have been the most successful teams in the tournament's history, winning all 6 of the 6 World Cups that have been staged between them, with Australia coming out on top in the last three tournaments beating New Zealand in each of the 3 finals. In two of the finals (2005, 2008) NZ would even prevent their opponents from scoring, with the 2005 final seeing a devastation of the New Zealand Maori team by 58 points. New Zealand in turn would be crushed 54 - 4 by Australia in the 2022 final.\nIn the first two World Cups, the home nations competed as Great Britain just as they did in the men's equivalent tournament up to the expansion of the competition in 1995. Since then, England have competed in GB's place. The 2005 tournament is the only one that has not been run alongside the men's tournament, all of the others taking place at the same time and using some of the same stadiums. The 2017 final was significant in that it was the first final to be played as a curtain-raiser to the men's final, this final taking place at Suncorp Stadium, Brisbane."

They currently compete in the NZRL National Competition (Zonal team) and the Rugby League Cup (District team).\nHistory.\n1908–1993.\nTaranaki competed in the very first season of provincial rugby league in New Zealand. They shared a two match series with Auckland 1-all. Taranaki was led by New Zealand international Adam Lile.\nIn 2008 the Taranaki Rugby League named its Team of the Century: Dave Watson; Babe Hooker; Ron McKay; Willie Talau; Ernest Buckland; Tony Kemp; Issac Luke; Bruce Gall; Howie Tamati; Wille Southorn; Graeme West; Adam Lile; Barry Harvey. Bench: Jack McLeod; Fred White; Lance Moir; Jim Parker; Charles Hunt.\n1994–1996: Lion Red Cup.\nAs the Taranaki Rockets, Taranaki competed in the Lion Red Cup between 1994 and 1996. They were coached by Teri Tamati, Allan Marshall and Howard Tamati over the three years of the competition.\nThe team was originally going to be called the Taranaki Energisers but this name was vetoed by Eveready Batteries who owned the name in New Zealand.\n1997–2002.\nIn 1997 the Taranaki Rugby League side that competed in the Super League Challenge Cup was also called the Rockets.\nThey adopted the Sharks nickname in 1998 after a public competition. Notable players included Paul Rauhihi, Iva Ropati and Artie Shead.\n2002–2003: Bartercard Cup.\nIn 2002 and 2003 the Taranaki Wildcats competed in the Bartercard Cup. They were coached by Alan Jackson.\nSeason results.\nThe Wildcats entered the competition in 2002 alongside the Central Falcons. They managed to compete in most games, winning two and with two draws. This was not enough to avoid the wooden spoon but most pundits predicted they would be better for the experience in 2003.\nIn 2003 they again collected the wooden spoon, only managing to win one game all season.\n2008–2009: Bartercard Premiership.\nTaranaki were part of the Bartercard Premiership in 2008 and 2009, however they were not competitive and finished last and second to last in each year.\n2010–present: National Competition.\nIn 2010, they joined the NZRL National Competition from the defunct Bartercard Premiership.\nNotable players.\nThe Taranaki team of the century was named in 2008 and included: 1.

        "title": "England A national rugby union team",
        "text": "England A is England's men's second national rugby union team. The team has previously been known by a number of names, such as England B, Emerging England and, most recently, England Saxons. England A play a key role in the development of emerging talent, allowing players to gain experience in an international environment and to show that they have the ability to perform at Test level for the England first team. England A were unbeaten for 13 games until losing to Ireland A, now known as Ireland Wolfhounds, in the 2009 Churchill Cup Final on 21 June 2009.\nEngland A was one of three sides that regularly competed in the now-defunct annual Churchill Cup competition, the others being the full national teams of Canada and the United States. Since 2006, they have also played two matches, against Ireland Wolfhounds and Italy A, in parallel with the full Six Nations Championship.\nConcept.\nEngland's second team was known as England B until 1992, when it was renamed as England A. In 2000, as part of its long-term strategic plan, the RFU re-examined the role of the 'second team' and decided that a change of name was desirable. Several names were considered – e.g. England Aces and England Bloods – before the name England Saxons was chosen from a short-list of possibles. The change of name took effect from mid-May 2006, just before the start of that year's Churchill Cup. They reverted to England A in May 2021.\nEngland A are seen as an integral part of the RFU's development process:\nEngland A games do not count as full England internationals, regardless of the opposition, as players are not capped. However, the governing body of a lower-tier nation may grant full national caps when its senior side plays the Saxons—for example, USA Rugby awarded official Test caps for the USA team's matches against the Saxons in 2008. If the opposition awards Test caps for a match, it counts fully in Test statistics for the capping nation, though not for England.\nParticipation in international competition.\nEngland A / Saxons participated in the Churchill Cup from its inception in 2003 until its demise following the 2011 edition. Under the final format, they played three games, two at the pool stage and one on finals day. The Saxons also play two matches each season against teams from the other Six Nations countries (France, Scotland, Ireland, Italy and Wales), the games being played on the same weekends as Six Nations Championship matches. Since 2006, the Saxons' opponents in these games have been Ireland Wolfhounds and Scotland A.\nSquad.\nOn 15 February 2024, a provisional 27-player England A squad was named for a training camp at Loughborough University, ahead of a friendly fixture against Portugal at Welford Road in Leicester on 25 February 2024.\nCall-ups.\nOn 20 February 2024, Charlie Ewels, Joe Heyes, Max Ojomoh and Will Muir were added to the England A squad, following their release from the England senior squad."

        "text": "Brian Keith Kelly (born October 25, 1961) is an American college football coach. He is the head football coach at Louisiana State University (LSU), a position he has held since the 2022 season. Kelly served as the head football coach at Grand Valley State University from 1991 to 2003, Central Michigan University from 2004 to 2006, the University of Cincinnati from 2006 to 2009, and the University of Notre Dame from 2010 to 2021. He led the Grand Valley State Lakers to consecutive NCAA Division II Football Championships in 2002 and 2003. Kelly's 2012 Notre Dame team reached the 2013 BCS National Championship Game, while his 2018 and 2020 teams made appearances in the College Football Playoff.\nEarly years.\nKelly was born in Everett, Massachusetts, and was raised in a Catholic Irish-American family in Chelsea, Massachusetts. He attended St. John's Preparatory School in Danvers, Massachusetts. His father was a Boston politician. He was a four-year club football player at Assumption College as a linebacker. After graduating from Assumption in 1983 with a bachelor's degree in political science he served as linebackers coach, defensive coordinator, and softball coach from 1983 to 1986.\nCoaching career.\nGrand Valley State.\nKelly joined the Grand Valley State University staff in 1987 as a graduate assistant and defensive backs coach for Tom Beck and became the defensive coordinator and recruiting coordinator in 1989. Kelly took over as head coach in 1991. In his final three seasons the Lakers went 41–2, at one point winning 32 consecutive games. The Lakers went 14–0 in 2002 en route to their first national title and went 14–1 in 2003 when they claimed their second national championship. Kelly was named the AFCA Division II Coach of the Year after each of these championship years.\nIn his 13 years as head coach at Grand Valley State, the Lakers won five conference titles and made six Division II Playoff appearances.\nThe 2001 team set 77 NCAA, GLIAC, and school records, including the all-time Division II scoring record, averaging 58.4 points per game.\nKelly's record in 13 years at Grand Valley State was 118–35–2.\nCentral Michigan.\nKelly became the 24th head coach at Central Michigan University after the departure of Mike DeBord following the 2003 season.\n2004 season.\nKelly inherited a team with limited success. Central Michigan had won more than three games only once in the previous four seasons. CMU finished with a 4–7 record in 2004.\n2005 season.\nIn Kelly's second year at Central Michigan, he coached the team to a 6–5 record—the first winning season in seven years for the Chippewas.\n2006 season.\nIn his third season, the Chippewas posted a 9–4 record under Kelly en route to winning the MAC Championship over Ohio and qualifying for the Motor City Bowl. At the end of the 2006 season, Kelly left to accept the Cincinnati coaching vacancy three days after CMU won the 2006 MAC Championship. Jeff Quinn was named the interim for Central Michigan's contest in the Motor City Bowl against Middle Tennessee. Kelly's record at Central Michigan in three seasons was 19–16.\nCincinnati.\nKelly was named Cincinnati's head coach on December 3, 2006, following the departure of Mark Dantonio.\n2006 season.\nIn an unusual move, Cincinnati elected not to appoint an interim coach and asked Kelly to assume his duties immediately by coaching the Bearcats in their bowl game. Central Michigan was also preparing for a bowl appearance, so while Kelly was in Cincinnati preparing the Bearcats, much of his staff remained at Central Michigan to coach the Chippewas. Following Central Michigan's 31–14 win in the Motor City Bowl on December 26, most of his staff joined him in Cincinnati, where they went on to coach Cincinnati to a 27–24 victory over Western Michigan University in that year's International Bowl on January 6. Cincinnati's victory gave Kelly the unique distinction of having defeated the same team twice in a season as coach of two different teams (Central Michigan had defeated Western Michigan 31–7 earlier that season).\n2007 season.\nIn his first full season, Kelly led Cincinnati to a competitive position in the Big East; the Bearcats' second ever 10-win season (its first since 1949); and a top-25 ranking. On December 5, 2007, Kelly was named Big East Coach of the Year after leading the Bearcats to a 9–3 record. Coach Kelly later led the Bearcats to a 31–21 victory in the PapaJohns.com Bowl over Southern Miss.\n2008 season.\nIn 2008, Kelly led Cincinnati to its first ever outright Big East title with key wins over #20 West Virginia and #20 Pittsburgh. The Bearcats had never defeated either team in Big East conference play. Kelly also became the first coach to win all three of the Bearcats' traveling trophies— the Victory Bell (Miami [OH]), the Keg of Nails (Louisville), and the River City Rivalry Trophy (Pitt). The Bearcats played in the Orange Bowl versus the ACC champion, #21 Virginia Tech on January 1, 2009, but lost 20–7. He won Big East Coach of the Year for the 2008 season.\n2009 season.\nAfter beginning the 2009 season unranked in all polls, Kelly's Bearcats reeled off 12 straight victories and finished the regular season undefeated. Going into the bowl season, they were ranked #3 in the BCS Standings and faced the Florida Gators in the Sugar Bowl. Kelly did not coach the team in the 51–24 loss to the Florida Gators because of his departure to Notre Dame.\nAmong the honors that Cincinnati football achieved in 2009 was the highest academic rating among teams in the top 10 of the current BCS standings, according to the 2009 Graduation Success Rates, released Wednesday, November 18, by the NCAA. Cincinnati, which was fifth in the BCS standings, checked in with a 75 percent NCAA graduation rate and a 71 percent federal government rate, the only team in the BCS top 10 to surpass the 70 percent plateau in both. He won Big East Coach of the Year for the third time. In addition, he won the Home Depot Coach of the Year.\nKelly finished his tenure at Cincinnati with a 34–6 record. He finished second in school history in wins.\nNotre Dame.\nIn December 2009, Kelly agreed to replace Charlie Weis as Notre Dame's head coach. On December 10, Kelly announced that he had taken the position at Notre Dame. He made the decision not to coach the Bearcats in the Sugar Bowl on January 1, 2010, which the Bearcats lost in a blowout to the University of Florida Gators.\n2010 season.\nIn 2010, Kelly beat Purdue 23–12 in his first game at Notre Dame but lost to Michigan 28–24 the following week. In the following game, they lost on a fake field goal in overtime against Michigan State 34–31. His team lost again at home against #16 Stanford before beating Boston College to put the Irish at 2–3. On October 9, Kelly led the Fighting Irish to a 23–17 win over Pitt, snapping Notre Dame's 2-game losing streak to the Panthers taking the Irish to a 3–3 record on the season.\nIn late October, Declan Sullivan, a student videographer, was killed during practice when the hydraulic lift he was using collapsed due to high winds. Kelly acknowledged it was his decision to hold practice outdoors that day. The University was fined $77,500 by the Indiana Occupational Health and Safety Administration for safety violations related to the incident. \nKelly led Notre Dame to a 44–20 win over Western Michigan to extend the Irish's winning streak to three games. The next week they faced Navy, losing 35–17 to drop to 4–4 overall.\nWhen the Irish faced Tulsa, they were upset 28–27. They sent out second string quarterback Tommy Rees who threw an interception with 30 seconds left in the game as the Irish had driven to the Tulsa 28-yard line and a potential game-winning field goal attempt. Two weeks later Notre Dame played against No. 15 Utah, who was heavily favored. Utah was leading 3–0 early, but a special teams touchdown after a deflected punt and three Rees touchdown passes lifted the Notre Dame lead to 28–3. The victory over Utah gave Kelly a 5–5 record. Notre Dame followed that win up with a 27–3 victory over Army to make Kelly and the Fighting Irish bowl eligible. In the final game of the season, Notre Dame snapped an 8-game losing streak against its rival USC, winning 20–16 due to a strong defensive display, despite four turnovers by the Fighting Irish's offense. Kelly's first Fighting Irish team was invited to play in the Sun Bowl, where they beat Miami 33–17.\n2011 season.\nIn 2011, Notre Dame returned numerous starters from the previous year and was thought to be in contention for a BCS bowl bid. However, in the opening game against South Florida, Notre Dame outgained its opponent 508–254 in yardage but lost 23–20 due to five turnovers (most within scoring range). The next week the Irish built a 24–7 lead against its rival Michigan but lost yet again 35–31 due to five turnovers.\nThe following week the Irish defeated #15 Michigan State 31–13; the one-sided victory over the Spartans was the first of four wins in a row until the USC Trojans came to South Bend. The Fighting Irish were behind early in the game but were driving toward an apparent tie when a fumbled snap on the Trojan three-yard line was returned by USC for a touchdown. Notre Dame never recovered, turning the ball over three times in the loss.\nNotre Dame then went on its second four-game win streak until losing to #4 Stanford 28–14 in the regular season finale. At 8–4, the Irish secured a bid to the Champs Sports Bowl, where they played Florida State. Against Florida State, Notre Dame again built a lead (14–3 after three quarters) but lost 18–14 due to three crucial turnovers, ending the season with an 8–5 record.\n2012 season.\nNotre Dame opened their 2012 season with a special season opener in Dublin, Ireland. In the game, they defeated Navy 50–10. Notre Dame won their week 2 game against Purdue at home, winning 20–17, on a field goal by sophomore Kyle Brindza. In week 3, Notre Dame defeated #10 Michigan State by a score of 20–3. In week 4, #11 Notre Dame defeated #18 Michigan by a score of 13–6, recovering six turnovers in the process. The Irish defeated Miami, #17 Stanford, and BYU before playing Oklahoma. At 7–0, Notre Dame traveled to Norman and defeated #8 Oklahoma 30–13, only the fifth home loss for the Sooners under Bob Stoops. On November 3, the Irish narrowly avoided an upset by beating Pittsburgh 29–26 in three overtimes. Notre Dame had rallied from a fourth quarter deficit of 14 points to tie the game late in regulation. On November 10, #4 ranked Notre Dame traveled to Boston College and faced a team known for spoiling Notre Dame perfect seasons. Notre Dame won 21–6, not allowing Boston College to score a touchdown and improving to 10–0. On November 17, Notre Dame went undefeated at home for the first time since 1998 with a 38–0 victory over Wake Forest. On November 18, following the losses of #1 Kansas State and #2 Oregon, Notre Dame was voted the #1 team in the nation for the first time since 1993 and was #1 in the BCS rankings for the first time ever. With a 22–13 defeat of USC, Notre Dame finished the regular season 12–0. On Monday, January 7, 2013, Kelly and the Fighting Irish lost, 42–14, to the Alabama Crimson Tide in the 2013 BCS National Championship Game. Kelly's Irish finished the season ranked #3 in the USA Today Coaches poll and #4 in the Associated Press Top 25 poll. In 2014, Notre Dame discovered that an athletic trainer had provided impermissible help to eight players during this and the following season. Notre Dame reported this violation to the NCAA, and was then controversially forced on November 22, 2016, to vacate all of their 2012 (and 2013) victories, finishing the season with an adjusted record of 0–1, after the NCAA rejected Notre Dame's appeal on February 13, 2018. Kelly earned AFCA Coach of the Year, AP Coach of the Year, Eddie Robinson Coach of the Year, Bear Bryant Coach of the Year, Walter Camp Coach of the Year, and Home Depot Coach of the Year for his 2012 season.\n2013 season.\nThe Spring of the 2013 season saw Notre Dame lose its starting quarterback Everett Golson for academic violations(later revealed to be cheating on a test) leading Brian Kelly to name Tommy Rees as the starting quarterback.

More clubs were founded in the 1990s, and the Finnish Cricket Association was founded in 1999. They became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) the following year.

        "title": "South Korea men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The South Korea men's national basketball team () represents South Korea in international basketball competitions. They are administered by the Korea Basketball Association.\nBased on the number of overall medals won, South Korea is a major force among the national teams of FIBA Asia. \nAt the FIBA Asia Cup, they have won a record 25 medals in the competition. Furthermore, South Korea is the only nation that has qualified for every edition of the event since it was first held in 1960. While on the global level, South Korea has qualified for the FIBA World Cup eight times throughout their history.\nHistory.\nInitiation (1947–1951).\nIn 1947, two years after the establishment of the People's Republic of Korea, the Korea Basketball Association joined the International Federation of Basketball (FIBA) and sent its national teams to FIBA-sponsored events. Only one year later, the team already celebrated its first major accomplishment at the 1948 Summer Olympics, when it finished 8th, better than any other Asian nation, and ahead of teams such as Canada, Argentina, and Italy.\nSteady improvements (1952–1968).\nAt the 1954 Asian Games, for the first time ever, South Korea finished in the \"Final Four\" of a major international basketball tournament in Asia. The team slowly improved its position within Asia almost every year and qualified for the Basketball World Cup several times.\nGolden years (1969–1970).\nIn 1969 and 1970, the team enjoyed a brief period to shine, when it won the 1969 Asian Championship and the 1970 Asian Games and ultimately qualified for the 1970 FIBA World Championship. As the only Asian team that had remained in the championship, South Korea finished ahead of Australia (champion of FIBA Oceania) and Egypt (champion of FIBA Africa) and showed its best performance ever at this event. Korea's Shin Dong-Pa dominated all scorers at the 1970 FIBA World Cup as he averaged 32.6 points per game, almost 13 points more than the runner up, Davis Peralta, from Panama.\nAsian elite position behind China (1971–2007).\nAt the Asian Championship, South Korea stayed among the top three teams at 21 straight events, a record that is still unmatched until today. \nAt the 1996 Olympics, Hyun Joo-Yup averaged 16.6 points through the entire tournament. \nAt the 2005 FIBA Asia Championship, South Korea's medal-winning streak finally ended when they lost to Qatar at the 3rd place game . Between 1975 and 2005, South Korea was the only nation besides the Philippines that was able to seriously challenge China's dominance. It interrupted China's championship winning streak in 1997, when it defeated its dominant neighbor in the semifinals and ultimately won the crown as 1997 Champion of Asia.\nAt the 2007 FIBA Asia Championship, South Korea was able to go on a streak, and won the first 5 games. Because of the \"four centers\" Ha Seung-jin (221 cm), Kim Joo-sung (205 cm), Lee Dong-jun (202 cm), and Kim Min-soo (200 cm), South Korea had the tournament's highest 2-point field goal percentage (61%). South Korea was also a team that had a strong back court with Kim Seung-hyun (179 cm), Yang Dong-geun (182 cm), Kim Dong-woo (198 cm), and Choi Jin-soo (205 cm), who guaranteed that the team was in the tournaments top-3 in free throw percentage (70.6) and assists per game (11.5). All these players helped their team to win the bronze medal once again.\nEmergence of West Asian competition (2008–2018).\nIn the modern era, South Korea's competition from West Asia intensified as countries such as Jordan, Qatar, Lebanon, and especially Iran improved their basketball programs. South Korea is still considered one of Asia's major teams but its position among the top three teams in Asia is not guaranteed anymore. In 2014, the team qualified for the Basketball World Cup for the first time in almost 20 years. Even though the team was eliminated in the first round, the qualification itself was a success and provided much needed global exposure. Most of the players that played at the 2014 World Cup returned for the 2014 Asian Games where they helped secure the gold medal on home soil.\nFormer Jeonju KCC Egis manager Hur Jae took over as the national team coach in 2016. They reached the play-offs of the 2017 FIBA Asia Cup and won the bronze medal. At the 2018 Asian Games, South Korea was unable to defend their tournament gold medal due to the loss of key players to injuries. The public outcry, coupled by accusations that Hur had showed favoritism by selecting both his sons into the national team, prompted Hur to resign in September. Hur's former assistant Kim Sang-shik took over as the new coach.\n2019 FIBA World Cup and generational change (2019–present).\nUnder Kim Sang-shik, the South Korean team secured their place at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup. Kim also began introducing younger players into the squad on a more regular basis. However, Kim decided on a more experienced squad, with half the players selected aged 30 and above and Heo Hoon being the youngest player at 24. South Korea struggled with injury problems to key players during the tournament but ended their losing streak at the World Cup. They recorded their first win at the World Cup in 25 years by winning their last game of the tournament, a 80-71 win over the Ivory Coast. \nMore signs of a \"generational change\" were visible as Kim called-up a squad composed only of players born in the 1990's for a 2022 FIBA Asia Cup qualifier against Indonesia. However, the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted much of 2020 as the closing of international borders and government-mandated quarantine regulations discouraged KBL teams from releasing valuable players to the national team, prompting a conflict between the Korean Basketball League (KBL) and the Korean Basketball Association (KBA). Kim resigned in late January 2021, citing his frustration over being caught in between the KBL and KBA and the failure of all parties to come to a resolution. Cho Sang-hyun took over in September 2021 and is expected to remain in charge until the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup.\nIn preparation of South Korea's participation in the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers, a two-week break from the regular season was scheduled in February 2022 for the national team call-ups. The Korean Basketball League was hit by the coronavirus as early as December 2021, with Changwon LG Sakers reporting their first case within the team. At the end of January 2022, KBL even made their first-ever match postponement due to the coronavirus, as multiple positive cases were reported in Seoul Samsung Thunders. Although stringent testing requirements and quarantine rules were implemented by KBL, it failed to lower the number of infections in the league. In February 2022, a massive outbreak occurred as many teams reported positive cases among their players and staff within a span of two weeks. Some teams could not field their main players as they were infected. Even so, KBL carried on with the scheduled matches as long as the participating teams could fill up the roster. Some players eventually took to social media to express their frustration publicly over the forced commencement of the league and lack of concern towards the wellbeing of the players. On the next day, KBL announced a suspension of the season for two weeks by postponing all remaining matches scheduled in February to a later date. The national basketball team took a major hit as most of the players on the preliminary roster submitted to FIBA at an earlier date, were infected by the coronavirus. Despite Cho's efforts of putting together a new roster, a player from the renewed roster was tested positive right before they depart to the Philippines on February 22. As a result, South Korea pulled out of the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup Asian qualifiers and was eventually disqualified. South Korea did try to appeal that decision, but it was rejected by FIBA. Hence, South Korea's appearance in the 2023 FIBA World Cup and the 2024 Summer Olympics is unclear as of now.\nOn April 29, 2022, Cho was announced as the new head coach of Changwon LG Sakers, and terminated his contract as the national team's head coach. After an open recruitment of a new head coach by the Korean Basketball Association, Choo Il-seung, previously a head coach for Goyang Orion Orions was chosen to lead the men's national basketball team effective May 19, 2022.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nTournament: 2022 FIBA Asia Cup (July 12, 2022 – July 24, 2022)\nPast rosters.\n1970 World Championship: finished 11th among 13 teams\nShin Dong-pa, Lee In-pyo, Kim In-kun, Kim Young-il, Park Han, Choi Jong-kyu, Yoo Hee-hyung, Lee Byung-koo, Yoo Jung-kun, Lee Ja-young, Shin Hyun-soo, Kwak Hyun-chae (Coach: Kim Young-ki)\n1978 World Championship: finished 13th among 14 teams\nKim In-Jin, Kim Pyung-Man, Jung Young-Soo, Jang Bong-Hak, Park Sang-Ung, Park Soo-Kyo, Kim Sang-Chun, Kim Hyung-Nyun, Kim Dong-Kwang, Koo Jong-Hoo, Lee Mun-Kyu, Choi Bu-Young (Coach: Kim Moo-Hyung)\n1986 World Championship: finished 22nd among 24 teams\nHur Jae, Park In-kyu, Lee Min-hyun, Cho Yoon-ho, Han Ki-bum, Lee Mun-kyu, Kim Hyun-jun, Kim You-taek, Kim Sung-wook, Lee Won-woo, Lee Chung-hee, Goh Myong-hwa (Coach: Kim In-kun)"

He was a starting pitcher for the Elizabeth Resolutes of the National Association. His younger brother, Mike Campbell, was the team's starting first baseman.\nHe pitched much better than his 2–16 record would indicate. The Resolutes won 2, lost 21, and made 247 errors, an average of 10.7 per game, with Campbell himself making 21 of them. As a result, he gave up 213 runs in 165 innings pitched, but only 52 of them were earned runs. His ERA was 2.95, which was better than the league average, and was in fact sixth-best in the league. His two victories came against the Brooklyn Atlantics and the Boston Red Stockings.\nCampbell died at the age of 34 in Newark, New Jersey of phthisis pulmonalis, and is interred at Holy Sepulchre Cemetery in East Orange, New Jersey."

        "title": "Basketball in the Philippines",
        "text": " \nBasketball is the most popular sport in the Philippines, played on both the amateur and professional levels.\nHistory.\nAmerican era and the Philippine NCAA.\nBasketball was introduced in the Philippines during the American colonial period with the first American teachers teaching the sport along with baseball through the YMCA and the school system. Basketball was first introduced to the Philippine public school system by the Americans as a women's sport in 1910 and was played in Interscholastic meets in 1911 until 1913. Women's basketball met opposition from conservative groups, particularly the Catholic Church who view bloomers worn by women basketball players as inappropriate. By the time skirts were allowed to be worn above bloomers as a compromise, women's basketball was already in decline and was only played in provincial and local interscholastic meets. Indoor softball and as well as volleyball became the more preferred sport for Filipino women.\nThe first men's national team – organized in the 1910s – won the first Far Eastern Championship Games in 1913. In all but one of the ten editions of the games, the national team won the gold medal.\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), which had basketball as its main sport, was established in 1924.\nFIBA beginnings, the MICAA, and international play.\nThe Philippines became a member of FIBA through the Basketball Association of the Philippines in 1936. The Philippines made their debut in the Olympic Games in 1936 where they finished fifth, the best result of an Asian team in Olympic basketball history. In the same year, the first basketball stamp in the world was released by the country. The first commercial league was the basketball tournament of the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA) which was established in 1938.\nThe Philippines became an independent country in 1946, and in the 1950s, the national team did well in international tournaments. The Philippine team won the gold medal at the Asian Games in 1951, the first-time basketball was played. The Philippine basketball team dominated the Asian Games until 1962.\nAfter missing the first FIBA Basketball World Cup (known through 2010 as the FIBA World Championship) that was held in 1950 in Argentina, the Philippines participated in the 1954 FIBA World Championship held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The Philippines finished with a 5–2 win–loss record in the Final Round games, and captured the bronze medal. The third place-finish is still currently the best finish by an Asian country in the World Cup. Carlos Loyzaga finished as the world tournament's third leading scorer (148 points/16.4 points per game) and was named in the FIBA World Mythical Five Selection.\nIn the 1960s, the first FIBA Asia Championship was won by the Philippines with Carlos Badion as the tournament's Most Valuable Player.\nMeanwhile, the Philippines won the right to host the third FIBA World Championship, but were suspended after then-President Diosdado Macapagal, father of former President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, refused to issue visas to players from communist countries (notably basketball powerhouse Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union).\nThe Philippines' dominance in sport waned after Carlos Loyzaga's retirement, and had performed poorly in the Olympic games where the national team was unable to break into top-10 positions. However, the country continued to play competitively in the Asian and World Championships.\nThe PBA, first World Cup hosting, and the end of the BAP era.\nThe commercial league model pioneered by the MICAA continued with the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) in 1975 and the Philippine Amateur Basketball League (PABL) in 1983. The PBA is the first professional basketball league in Asia and the second oldest in the world after the NBA. The league's regulations are a hybrid of rules from FIBA and the NBA. The league was inaugurated on April 9, 1975. The PABL was established to fill the void created after the collapse of the MICAA in 1981.\nIn 1978, the Philippines hosted the FIBA World Championship, marking the first time that the international tournament was held in Asia.\nIn 1992, a poll was conducted by Enervon C asking 62 basketball experts to list their top ten Filipino basketball players of all time, with first place being worth ten points and a decrease in one point for each succeeding place. Ranking first was Caloy Loyzaga, who received the most points with 603; in second place was Robert Jaworski with 458 points, while third place went to Ramon Fernandez with 332 points.\nIn 1999, the Metropolitan Basketball Association (MBA) was established. It was the first league in the Philippines to use a home-and-away format like most other sports leagues. The MBA, however, would cease operations in 2002.\nThe Philippines was suspended by FIBA in 2005 due to a leadership crisis which affected the former national basketball association of the country – the Basketball Association of the Philippines.\nThe SBP, second World Cup hosting, and further development.\nIn 2007, the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas became the newly recognized national basketball body for the Philippines by FIBA.\nIn 2009, Smart Gilas Pilipinas was officially launched to help the Philippines qualify for the 2012 London Olympics. They failed after finishing fourth in the 2011 FIBA Asia Championship. In 2013, the Philippines qualified for the 2014 FIBA World Cup with a second-place finish in the 2013 FIBA Asia Championship. That year also saw the boys' U-16 team qualify for the 2014 FIBA U-17 World Championship, and the boys' U-18 team winning the inaugural Fiba-Asia 3x3 U18 Championship. In 2015, the women's team was promoted to Level 1 after a win against India.\nIn 2017, the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League (MPBL) was inaugurated. The MPBL paved the way for future grassroots-level leagues in the future, including the National Basketball League (NBL) in 2018, Pilipinas VisMin Super Cup in 2021, and the Pilipinas Super League (PSL) in 2022. FilBasket was also established in 2021, which would go on to become \"AsiaBasket\" in 2023.\nHeading into the 2020s, numerous Filipino basketball players play overseas in different leagues, with examples being Thirdy and Kiefer Ravena and others in the Japanese B. League, Jack Animam in Serbia, and Kai Sotto in the Australian NBL and later the B. League. Sotto would go on to declare for the 2022 NBA draft but went undrafted, Sotto would be picked up by the Orlando Magic for the 2023 NBA Summer League.\nGilas Pilipinas went on to qualify for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup and then the 2023 FIBA Basketball World Cup, the latter marks the Philippines' second hosting of the event, this time co-hosting with Japan and Indonesia."

It peaked on Boxing Day, 26 December, which is celebrated as St. Stephen's Day in Ireland.\nStorm.\nThe storm lasted from 3:00 on 24 December to 15:00 on 29 December 1998, peaking on 26 December. The Met Office reported that mean speeds over land reached nearly over a period of twelve hours, with gusts exceeding and being recorded at over were recorded at some locations. \nThe storm followed a period of higher than average rainfall, with 400 mm to 800 mm falling in the west of the country and 200 mm to 300 mm in the east, in the four-month period from September to December. This softened the soil, making trees more vulnerable to wind. The Met Office estimated that a storm on the magnitude of the one in December 1998 occurs around once every four years somewhere in Britain, and once every twenty at any given point, with the wind coming in a belt around wide.\nDamage.\nLarge parts of northern England and Scotland lost access to electricity. 50,000 households were without electricity for more than 24 hours, with some supplies not restored until the New Year. Six electricity companies in Great Britain declared a systems emergency as a result of the damage.\nThe reactors at Hunterston B nuclear power station were shut down when power was lost, possibly due to arcing at pylons caused by salt spray from the sea. When the grid connection was restored, the generators that had powered the station during the blackout were shut down and left on \"manual start\", so when the power failed again the station was powered by batteries for a short time of around 30 minutes, until the diesel generators were started manually. During this period the reactors were left without forced cooling, in a similar fashion to the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, but the event at Hunterston was rated as INES 2.\nExternal links.\nBBC Weather forecasts for Christmas 1998 and the Boxing Day storm."

The team made its One Day International (ODI) debut in 1989, at the European Championship, and went on to qualify for both the 1993 and 1997 World Cups, winning a single match at each tournament. Denmark played its last ODIs to date in 1999, and has played only in minor regional tournaments since then.\nIn April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Denmark women and other ICC members after 1 July 2018 will be a full WT20I.\nHistory.\nDenmark's ODI debut came at the 1989 Women's European Cricket Cup, which they hosted, and placed as runners up in. They were also runners up in the 1991 tournament. They made two appearances in the World Cup, finishing 7th in 1993 and 10th in 1997. Their only ODIs outside the European Championship and World Cup were two series against the Netherlands played at the Mikkelberg-Kunst-und-Cricket Center in Germany in 1997 and 1998. Their most recent ODI was played against Netherlands on 21 July 1999. By this point women's cricket in Denmark was struggling for players with the Danish Cricket Federation reducing the national league to 8 players per side from the 2000 season.\nDenmark returned to international competition in August 2013, featuring in a five-team tournament in Bologna (along with Estonia, Gibraltar, Italy, and Belgium). They finished runner-up to Italy, winning three out of four matches. In August 2014, Denmark played an international 20-over tournament in Berlin, with six other European teams. They won only two of their six matches (defeating Gibraltar and Belgium by nine wickets each), consequently finishing the tournament in fifth place, behind Italy, Germany, France, and Jersey.\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Denmark Women\n\"Last updated 26 August 2023\"\nOne-Day International.\nMost ODI runs for Denmark Women \nMost ODI wickets for Denmark Women \nODI record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to Women ODI #306.

Papua New Guinea won the series against Japan three–nil, but at the World Cup Qualifier won only two matches, both against Bermuda.\nThe team failed to qualify for either the 2011 World Cup Qualifier or the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier, with Japan representing the EAP region on both occasions.\nAt the 2015 Pacific Games, which Papua New Guinea hosted, a women's cricket event was included for the first time. The team narrowly lost to Samoa in the final, having been undefeated up to that point. Later in the year, Papua New Guinea participated at its second global tournament, the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier, placing fifth out of eight teams.\nIn April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Papua New Guinea women and other international sides since 1 July 2018 are eligible for WT20I status.\nThe team played its first WT20I match against Bangladesh on 7 July 2018 at VRA Cricket Ground, Amstelveen in Netherlands in the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup.

The team is organised by Cricket Scotland, an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nScotland was involved in the first international women's cricket match, when they played against England in August 1932. The team played sporadically throughout the remainder of the 20th century, with regular competition beginning only in 2000. Scotland's first international tournament was the 2001 European Championship, where matches held One Day International (ODI) status. The team's only other ODI appearances to date came at the 2003 IWCC Trophy in the Netherlands, a qualifier for the 2005 World Cup. Outside regional tournaments, Scotland has only qualified for two major events since then – the 2008 World Cup Qualifier and the 2015 World Twenty20 Qualifier.\nIn April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Scotland women and another international side after 1 July 2018 will be eligible for WT20I status. In May 2022, the ICC announced Scotland as one of five women's sides to gain ODI status. Netherlands, Papua New Guinea, Thailand and the United States are the other four teams.\nHistory.\nIn , a Scottish women's team played England at New Road, Worcester, in what was the first international women's cricket fixture. Four members of the inaugural Scottish women's side – Betty Snowball, Myrtle Maclagan, Joy Liebert, and Betty Archdale – later played in Test matches for England. After 1932, a Scottish women's team was not raised again until 1979, when a fixture was played against a Junior England team at Malvern College, Worcestershire.\nScotland made their international tournament debut at the 2001 edition of the Women's European Championship. They lost all three games, finishing last in the four-team tournament. Two years later, they played in the 2003 IWCC Trophy, the inaugural edition of what is now known simply as the World Cup Qualifier. They finished fifth in the six-team tournament, which was hosted by the Netherlands, with their only win coming against Japan.\nThey again played in the European Championship in 2005, but again went without a win and finished last. In 2008 they competed in the Women's World Cup qualifier in South Africa, finishing sixth in the tournament.\nIn 2014, Scotland was promoted to Division 2 of the Women's County Championship after losing only one game throughout the season. However, they suffered relegation the following season. In 2015, Scotland participated in the ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifiers for the first time, finishing fourth at the tournament in Thailand.\nIn April 2018, Kathryn Bryce was named the captain of the team. In July 2018, Scotland played its first official T20 international match against Uganda in the 2018 ICC Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier in the Netherlands.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup.

Their overall record in ODIs was played 18, won 3, lost 14, with one no result.\nHistory.\nInternational XI were formed to compete in the 1973 Women's Cricket World Cup, \"making up the numbers\" along with Young England after South Africa was not invited due to apartheid. The side was made up of players not selected for the other teams competing in the tournament. Five South African players were originally selected for the side, but withdrew after Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago threatened to boycott the tournament.

They played against England, losing the match by 135 runs after Enid Bakewell and Lynne Thomas hit centuries for the opposition. In their second match, they recorded their first win, chasing down New Zealand's first innings score of 136 by 2 wickets with just one ball remaining. They then lost to Young England before beating both Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, by 5 wickets and 7 wickets, respectively.

They competed in a five-team group alongside Australia, England, New Zealand and India, playing each team three times. The side was made up of players from the four other sides in the tournament, plus two players from the Netherlands. Sue Rattray of New Zealand was the only player to appear for the side at both World Cups, whilst in this edition of the tournament they were captained by Lynne Thomas.

        "title": "News of the World Darts Championship",
        "text": "The News of the World Championship was one of the first major organised darts competitions, which began in 1927. It became England's first national darts competition from 1947, as the years went by it gradually became international essentially becoming the first world darts Championship and was the hardest darts tournament to win until its demise in 1990. There was also a brief revival of the event in 1996/97, but it is now discontinued. It was organised by the National Darts Association of Great Britain (NDAGB).\nBefore the tournament was established, darts competitions were held in various forms around England – often as friendly matches between pubs. After World War I, pub breweries began arranging darts leagues which began to sow the seeds for the establishment of a national darts competition. The tournament was noted for using an 8 ft oche rather than the regulation 7 ft 6 inches One of these competitions was held in Hythe Street, Dartford, Kent in 1927. The competition was sponsored by a local Brewery, C.N Kidd &amp; Sons Ltd.\nOrigins.\nThe tournament was first organised in the 1927/28 season thanks to the help of the staff on the \"News of the World\" newspaper and other volunteers, who helped set up the competition. William Jewiss won the 1927 darts challenge cup sponsored by News of the World and C.N Kidd &amp; Sons brewery in Dartford.\nThere were around 1,000 entries in the first event, which was held in the Metropolitan area of London. The tournament then began to expand around the different counties in England. By 1938/39 there were six different regional events – London &amp; South England, Wales, Lancashire &amp; Cheshire, Yorkshire, the North of England and the Midland Counties.\nThe total entrants in the competition in 1938/39 were in excess of 280,000. Enormous interest was created that year by the London and South of England championship. A record crowd of 14,534 spectators filled the Royal Agricultural Hall, London in May to witness the final between Jim Pike (representing the Windmill Club, Southwark) and Marmaduke Brecon (Jolly Sailor, Hanworth, Middlesex). Brecon ran out the winner by two games to one. The tournament continued to attract 250,000 entries during the post war years.\nThere was, however no national champion of the event until after World War II. It was revived as a national competition in 1947/48, and continued to be described as \"the championship every dart player wants to win\" until its demise in the 1990s. It can also be classed as the first world darts championships as it went international and players from different countries entered and even won the tournament.\nIn 1979, Bobby George became the only player to win the championship without losing a leg. Stefan Lord was the only player from outside the United Kingdom to win the event.\nDemise.\nThe News of the World was the first nationally televised darts event as ITV broadcast the latter stages of the championship from 1972 to 1985, and again in 1987 and 1988. The 1986 event was not broadcast due to a technicians' strike.\nAs quickly as darts tournaments began to appear on television throughout the 1970s and into the early and mid 1980s, the bubble burst and all darts competitions except the World Championship disappeared from TV screens in 1989.\nThis big sudden slump in televised darts coverage meant that it came as no surprise that the News of the World Championship also ended after the 1990 event, with the last two events having been untelevised. As it happened, 1990 was also the first year that separate competitions were held for men and women.\nThe lack of televised darts coverage left some players frustrated by the lack of opportunity to make a living from darts, and in January 1992 they formed their own organisation to start up their own tournaments \"(see main article: Professional Darts Corporation, and Split in darts)\".\n1997 revival.\nThe News of the World Championship made a one-year reappearance in the 1996/97 season, when Sky Sports and the News of the World resurrected the competition.\nIn his autobiography, Phil Taylor says that his mentor, Eric Bristow always mocked him for never having won the competition and that it was the tournament that everyone wanted to win. Bristow himself recalled his father telling him: \"You're not a proper world champion until you've won the \"News of the World\"\". \nTaylor put the record straight by beating Ian White 2–0 in the final in June 1997, collecting the News of the World Big D Trophy, a cheque for £42,000 and a set of Unicorn golden darts. Following his victory, which also saw him take out the then England captain Martin Adams 2–1 in the semi-finals, Taylor was quoted as saying \"I've won five world titles – but this one means everything\".\nHowever, the overall response to the competition was disappointing and the News of the World decided against running it again. The tournament remains discontinued.\nTournament winners.\nMen.\nThe tournament was arranged on a regional basis from 1927 until 1939. The National Championship began in 1947–48 winners and runners-up included:\nMultiple winners.\nNo player has ever won the international title three times; seven players managed two wins each."

        "title": "Rugby Club Luxembourg",
        "text": "Rugby Club Luxembourg, abbreviated to RCL, is a rugby union club, based in Cessange, Luxembourg City, in southern Luxembourg. Luxembourg has no domestic league of its own, so RCL plays in neighbouring countries' leagues; they currently play in the German Rugby-Bundesliga, having previously competed in the Belgian and French National Leagues.\nThe club has grown rapidly in recent years, and now has over 500 members. Based at Stade Boy Konen, in Cessange, the club is looking to expand to two or three pitches to relieve excessive usage of Boy Konen. The club is widely held in regard as the premier club in Luxembourg having never lost the Luxembourg Cup, and continues to be the primary source of players for the Luxembourg national rugby union team.\nHistory.\nFounded in May 1973, RCL was the first Luxembourgian rugby club, established by a group of British expatriates working in Luxembourg City. The club consisted then and still does today of a mixture of nationalities, cultures, creeds, languages : Belgian, French, English, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, Australian, South African, Portuguese, Spanish, German, Dutch, Italian, Fijian, Norwegian, Luxembourgish, American, New Zealander, Ecuadorian, and Argentinian.\nThe club played its first competitive game against US Castillionnaise in September 1973. Up until 1995, the club played in the Alsace-Lorraine regional league and won the Alsace-Lorraine Cup in 1994. In that year, the team joined the Belgian second division, which it belonged to until 1998, when it earned promotion to the first division.\nIn 2001, the club decided to return to the French league system, again playing regionally in Alsace-Lorraine. It won its division in 2008 but, after an invitation to play in Germany, decided to join the German league system in 2009.\nThe inclusion of \"RCL\" in the 2009 promotion round to the 2nd Bundesliga caused some debate in regards to its legality, as the club had not qualified through the German league system and was not a member of any of the German regional rugby federations. However, RC Luxembourg's application was declared valid in regards to the German rugby federations rules and regulations and the team finished second in the promotion round, earning a place in the 2nd Bundesliga for 2009-10.\nThe club has in the past recruited several local sportsmen from other sports, including Stéphane Gillet, former Luxembourg national football team goalkeeper, as a back row. Prince Sébastien played for the club's under-20 team, and Grand Duke Henri visited the club to watch his youngest son play.\nA league reform in 2012 allowed the club promotion to the Bundesliga after the league was expanded from ten to 24 teams. RCL finished fifth in their group in the 2012-13 season and failed to qualify for the championship round, instead entering the second tier DRV-Pokal, but eventually withdrawing from the competition in October 2012. The club's reserve team however continued to play in Germany, competing in the fourth tier Regionalliga. The team competed in the tier three 3. Liga in 2013–14 and won its division and the competition with a finals victory over TGS Hausen, earning promotion to the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga.\nIn the 2014–15 season the club finished first in the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga qualification round – West &amp; 3rd in the south-west DRV-Pokal group and was knocked out by RC Leipzig in the quarter-finals of the play-offs after a first round victory over Veltener RC. The club won the western division of the 2. Bundesliga in 2015–16 and, after play-off victories over StuSta Munchen and München RFC, won its division and the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga Championship for the first time in the club's history, securing promotion to the Rugby-Bundesliga.\nIn the 2016-2017 season the club played in the Rugby-Bundesliga but was relegated and for the 2017-2018 season will be playing in the 2. Rugby-Bundesliga with the aim of being promoted. After winning the Bundesliga 2 division West, RCL faced Rugby Club Rottweil, runners-up from Bundesliga 2 division South, in the semifinals of the promotion play-offs. RCL won the game 35-19 in front of a large crowd at Cessange, reaching the promotion final against StuSta Munich. RCL beat Munich 18-12, after leading 18-0 at half time, gaining promotion to Bundesliga 1 and now hopes to establish itself in the German topflight for the 2018-2019 season.\nIn July 2018, the construction of covered spectator stands began and was completed by September 2018, now offering seating opportunities and shelter to the fans and improving the atmosphere at home games. A long needed club house is being constructed at Stade Boy Konen.\nIn the 2018-2019 season, RCL were able to maintain their spot in Rugby-Bundesliga and have been competing in this league since. After the 2021-2022 RCL got relegated to the second division. In the 2022-2023 season, RCL reached the play-off finals, but lost the relegation game against RSV Cologne 12-13, and the second relegation game against RK Heusenstamm. The goal remains to be promoted to Bundesliga one after the 2023-2024 season.\nResults in the German League.\nRecent seasons of the club:\n2021-22 Squad.\nNote: Players in Bold are internationally capped.\nPast Seasons.\n2019–20 season.\nIn a season cut short due to Covid, RCL had a mixed account. Following a slow start, losing 3 matches on the trot, RCL were able to beat RK Heuseunstamm away. Following this, they had several close losses. In 2020, RCL only fulfilled one promising fixture against league heavyweights SC Frankfurt 1880 before the Covid-19 pandemic forced the league to suspend all fixtures.\n2018–19 season.\nRCL won its season opener at home 37-14 against Neckersulm SU. In spring 2019, RCL achieved a surprise 12-29 away win against one of the German top teams RG Heidelberg, gaining a bonus point win. This was followed by another bonus point 39-17 win against RK Heusenstamm at home a week later. Beating former German Champion TV Pforzheim with a bonus point win at Stade Boy Konen, RCL secured a spot in the first Bundesliga for the 2019-2020 season.\nThe second team meanwhile came second in the Rheinlandpfalz/Luxembourg Regionalliga, behind fellow Luxembourg club Rugby Club Walferdange. Both teams qualified for the Bundesliga 2 play-offs.\n2017–18 season.\nIn the 2016-2017 season the club played in the Rugby-Bundesliga but was relegated to the second division. The club's 1st 15 played the 2017-2018 season in the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga with the aim of being promoted. After winning the Bundesliga 2 division West dominantly, RCL faced Rugby Club Rottweil, runners-up from Bundesliga 2 division South, in the semifinals of the promotion play-offs. RCL won the game 35-19 in front of a large crowd at Stade Boy Konen in Cessange, reaching the promotion final against StuSta Munich. RCL beat Munich 18-12, after leading 18-0 at half time, gaining promotion to Bundesliga 1 and now hopes to establish itself in the German topflight for the 2018-2019 season.\n2016–17 season.\nIn the 2016-2017 season, a season of too many changes, the club played in the Rugby-Bundesliga but with a newly constructed side, along with newly appointed coaches was relegated back to the second division in what proved to be a very tough season for the club. A huge amount was learned from this rather harsh experience.\n2015–16 season.\nThis was a breakout year for the club as it realised its goals under captain Paul Remedi by actually winning promotion for the first time to Bundesliga 1 in 2015–16 and, after play-off victories over StuSta Munchen and München RFC, won its division with many standout performances and victories. The team built on the progress from the previous year and realised its goals in front of large crowds and support for the knockout stages in Cessange. Winning 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga Championship for the first time in the club's history, securing promotion to the Rugby-Bundesliga was a landmark achievement and a sign of real progress for the club.\n2014–15 season.\nIn the 2014–15 season the club began a period of rebuilding &amp; success under a new coaching ticket involving ex-players John Paul Keane and Liam Fagan, along with Matt Bloomer and strong support from Club President Mr. David Evans as well as the club committee. The first team finished first in the 2nd Rugby-Bundesliga qualification round – West &amp; 3rd in the south-west DRV-Pokal group and was knocked out by a strong RC Leipzig side after an arduous journey to Leipzig in the quarter-finals of the play-offs following a first round victory over Veltener RC. The club won the western division of the 2. The club ran two senior mens and both teams competed with great team spirit in their respective leagues.\n2013-14 season.\nThe season of the Invincibles. Stuart Kelly took over the coaching with RCL 1st team winning Bundesliga 3 South/West defeating Hausen in the final, gaining promotion to Bundesliga 2 and the seconds won the Rheinland-Pfalz regional league. A great season with plenty of players at training and both teams ended the season undefeated in all matches. \n2012–13 season.\nFollowing three top 3 finishes in the Bundesliga division 2 (South and West), a league reorganisation saw the 1st team being moved up into the Bundesliga 1 where the team struggled with the overall condition, size and skill of the teams they were up against, many of which are semi-professional. The players competed well but were a level below. As a result, the club management decided to withdraw the 1st team from the league.\n2011–12 season.\nThe club in the 2011-2012 season underwent a rebuilding phase following the departure of 12 starting 1st team players from the previous season, for various reasons. Enda Horan, previously the 2nd team coach, stepped up following the sudden departure of the previous coach, and in line with the desired direction of the club management, worked on creating a club mentality and instilling competition for 1st team spots with the 2nd team acting as a joint development side and a means for aspiring 1st team players to prove themselves. With only one coach in charge and many missing players, the season began very poorly by RCL standards with many of the 2nd team players from the previous season filling in the vacuum left by the departed players, and struggling to cope with the step up. Several new arrivals bolstered the player numbers, most notably Michael Cawley on placement from University College Dublin, who shortly after joining was identified by Horan as being the perfect man to lead the team as captain. With the increased player base and increased squad fitness, the standard of play grew again and some positives victories were recorded. Unfortunately Cawley was injured against TSV Handschuhsheim II and was ruled out for the remainder of the regular season, as such club and international veteran Stuart Kelly took over the captaincy."

        "title": "Russia men's national basketball team",
        "text": "The Russia men's national basketball team () represents Russia in international basketball competition. They are organized and run by the Russian Basketball Federation (RBF). The team came into existence after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and its national team.\nIn the post-Soviet era, the Russia national team consisting of Soviet players under the guidance of Sergei Belov won the silver medal at EuroBasket 1993. It also won silver at the World Cup in consecutive appearances in 1994 and 1998.\nHowever, Belov's departure saw Russia face multiple disappointments, until David Blatt took over as head coach. Under Blatt's guidance, the national team became champions at EuroBasket 2007, and also won bronze medals at EuroBasket 2011 and the 2012 Summer Olympics.\nAfter Blatt left the staff in late 2012, Russian national basketball experienced a deep crisis due to corruption in the RBF, and the federation's conflict with FIBA. Following a failed performance at EuroBasket 2015, Russia did not qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics. The situation stabilized after members of the RBF, including president Yulia Anikeeva, were dismissed. The current head coach is Zoran Lukić.\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIBA banned Russian teams and officials from participating in FIBA basketball and FIBA 3x3 Basketball competitions.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1992–2000).\nThe history of post-Soviet basketball in Russia dates back to 1992. The head coach back then was Yuri Selikhov. The first major tournament Russia participated in was the EuroBasket 1993 in Germany. The roster included players from the USSR era, among them were Sergey Bazarevich, and Dmitry Sukharev. Russia became runners-up, losing in the final to Germany, 70–71.\nSergey Belov was appointed new head coach of the national team after the EuroBasket. Russia debuted at the 1994 World Cup, reaching the final, losing only to the United States, 91–137. At the EuroBasket 1995, Russia displayed a very mediocre performance at the tournament, where the national team eventually finished up in 7th place, with an (5-4) record overall. Two years later Russia beat France 108–89, to claim the bronze medal. At the 1998 World Cup, Russia took home the silver medal.\nThe final tournament under the guidance of Belov was the EuroBasket 1999 in France. In the quarterfinals, the national team lost to Italy, and in the classification matches defeated Germany, but lost to Lithuania in the fifth-place match.\nDecline (2000–2006).\nBelov was replaced by Stanislav Eremin as the new head coach in the new century. Russia debuted at their first Summer Olympic Games, in Sydney, Australia, in 2000. Russia lost two matches in the preliminary round and got to the quarterfinals from the bottom of the group, losing there to USA, 85–70. In the classification rounds, Russia lost to Canada, 86–83, in double overtime, finishing the Games in 8th place. At the EuroBasket 2001, the Russians took the overall 5th place. In the preliminary round, Russia won two out of three matches, defeating Bosnia and Herzegovina, Greece but falling to Italy. Russia qualified to the quarterfinals as one of the top teams from their group, but lost to Spain, 62–55. Russia won both matches in the classification phase, defeating Latvia and France. At the 2002 World Cup in Indianapolis, Russia exhibited a lackluster outing during the competition and failed to medal, ending in 10th place.\nIn 2002, Sergey Elevich was named the new head coach until 2003, when he was replaced by Sergei Babkov, who also coached for two years. However, Russia played poorly during this time, producing no outstanding results.\nBlatt era (2006–2012).\nOn 9 March 2006, the new head coach of the national team became American-Israeli David Blatt. The period under Blatt's guidance was marked by some great moments.\nRussia won EuroBasket 2007, defeating the host nation Spain. In the first quarter of the final, the Russians were 10 points down, losing offensive and defensive rebounds and failing to counter Pau Gasol. The team also started the game cold from the three-point line. However, in the 4th quarter Russia came back. With a minute and a half remaining in regulation Spain led by five points, but then David Blatt took a timeout, and Russia decreased the gap. In the final three seconds J. R. Holden converted on a difficult shot and Russia took the lead by one point. Spain quickly called timeout one second later. Out of the timeout Spain immediately got the ball in to Gasol, for a potential game winner, but the shot was off the mark, and Russia prevailed 60–59. Andrey Kirilenko was named MVP of the tournament.\nAt the 2008 Olympics, in the first match they defeated Iran, but then lost to Croatia, Lithuania, Australia, and Argentina. In the group phase Russia took fifth and finished their performance. At EuroBasket 2009, Russia was without its leader Kirilenko and Holden for personal reasons, and Victor Khryapa due to injury. They were replaced by young players Fedor Dmitriev, Egor Vyaltsev, and Kelly McCarty. The Russians still managed to reach the quarterfinals, but were eventually eliminated by Serbia, to finish 7th in the tournament.\nOn 12 December 2009, Russia received a wild card for the 2010 World Cup. In the preliminary phase, Russia finished second in their group after victories over Puerto Rico, the Ivory Coast, and Greece, but failed to win against Turkey. In the round of 16, they defeated New Zealand, but finished their performance in the quarterfinals, losing to the Americans, 79–89. Russia as in the last EuroBasket finished 7th, after losing to Argentina and defeating Slovenia.\nRussia participated at the EuroBasket 2011, winning 10 of 11 matches. They failed to reach the final after losing to France. In the bronze medal game, Russia in a tight game subdued Macedonia. Kirilenko was named to the All-Tournament Team.\nNotwithstanding their third place, Russia did not directly qualify for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but qualified instead through the qualifying tournament in Venezuela in early July 2012, where they did not lose a single match.\nAt the 2012 Olympics, Russia took the top position in their preliminary phase group, losing only to Australia before advancing. In the quarterfinals Russia defeated Lithuania, but then lost to Spain, 59–67. In the third-place match, Russia defeated Argentina, the Olympic champions of 2004, 81–77. Kirilenko became member of the All-Olympics Team according to ESPN. He was ranked third in blocks and steals, sixth in scoring and eighth in rebounding.\nOn 30 October 2012, Blatt decided to step down as head coach of the national team.\nCorruption in the RBF and decline (2012–2016).\nIn late December a new head coach was chosen, Bilbao Basket coach Fotis Katsikaris. 19 July 2013, three days before the training for the upcoming EuroBasket 2013, he decided not to coach the national team. On the next day he published an open letter in which he explained his decision. He felt that his actions were met with opposition from the administration of the Russian Basketball Federation, especially from acting president Yulia Anikeeva (the future president of the RBF who was arrested in 2016 for corruption), and criticized the dismissal of general manager Oleg Ushakov.\nKatsikaris was replaced by Vasily Karasev. Losing 4 out of 5 matches in the preliminary round against Italy, Greece, Sweden and Finland (only winning against Turkey). Team Russia finished in 24th place at the EuroBasket 2013, the worst result ever for the national team. Karasev was then replaced by Evgeny Pashutin on 29 November 2013.\nA vast majority of its players declined participating in the EuroBasket 2015, including Timofey Mozgov, Sergey Karasev, Pavel Podkolzin, Alexey Shved, Evgeny Voronov, Artem Vikhrov, Evgeny Valiev, and Sergey Tokarev. Anton Ponkrashov and Egor Vyaltsev were initially dismissed from the national team, but then returned. FIBA in the last moment allowed team Russia to participate in spite of the disqualification of the RBF. Russia lost four matches in a row to Israel, Poland, Finland, and France (only winning against Bosnia), and so failed to qualify for the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro; they finished 17th. Pashutin resigned on 29 October 2015.\nAn executive committee of the RBF on 20 January 2016 named a new head coach, Sergey Bazarevich. Russia planned to prepare for the EuroBasket 2017, but FIBA suspended the RBF in July 2015. However, later their membership was restored in November 2015. Their disqualification was annulled in late May 2016, and in September 2016 team Russia qualified for the EuroBasket.\nReturn to European success; Ban (2016–).\nAt the EuroBasket 2017, Russia defeated four of their five opponents Turkey, Serbia, Belgium, and Great Britain in the preliminary round, losing only to Latvia before advancing. In the knockout stage Russia beat Croatia, and in the quarterfinals closely defeated Greece to reach the semifinals. Serbia though proved to be too tough this time around defeating Russia 87–79 to reach the final. The bronze medal match between Russia and Spain was won by Spain, 93–85.\nAfter the Russian invasion of Ukraine, FIBA banned Russian teams and officials from participating in FIBA basketball and FIBA 3x3 Basketball competitions.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2019 FIBA World Cup.\nPast rosters.\n1993 EuroBasket: finished 2nd among 16 teams\n4 Vladimir Gorin, 5 Dmitry Shakulin, 6 Dmitry Sucharev, 7 Maksim Astanin, 8 Vitaly Nosov, 9 Sergei Bazarevich, 10 Sergei Babkov, 11 Mikhail Mikhailov, 12 Vasily Karasev, 13 Andrei Fetisov, 14 Sergei Panov, 15 Vladislav Kondratov (Coach: Yuri Selikhov)\n1994 FIBA World Cup: finished 2nd among 16 teams\n4 Sergei Bazarevich, 5 Sergei Babkov, 6 Evgeni Kisurin, 7 Mikhail Mikhailov, 8 Andrei Fetisov, 9 Dmitri Domani, 10 Sergei Panov, 11 Evgeni Pashutin, 12 Igor Grachev, 13 Sergei Ivanov, 14 Vasily Karasev, 15 Vitaly Nosov (Coach: Sergei Belov)\n1995 EuroBasket: finished 7th among 14 teams\n4 Vasily Karasev, 5 Igor Kudelin, 6 Dmitri Domani, 7 Evgeni Kisurin, 8 Evgeniy Pashutin, 9 Sergei Bazarevich, 10 Sergei Babkov, 11 Mikhail Mikhailov, 12 Andrei Fetisov, 13 Sergei Ivanov, 14 Sergei Panov, 15 Vitaly Nosov (Coach: Sergei Belov)\n1997 EuroBasket: finished 3rd among 16 teams\n4 Vasily Karasev, 5 Igor Kudelin, 6 Igor Kurashov, 7 Evgeni Kisurin, 8 Evgeniy Pashutin, 9 Dmitry Shakulin, 10 Sergei Babkov, 11 Mikhail Mikhailov, 12 Zakhar Pashutin, 13 Andrei Fetisov, 14 Sergei Panov, 15 Vitaly Nosov (Coach: Sergei Belov)\n1998 FIBA World Cup: finished 2nd among 16 teams\n4 Vasily Karasev, 5 Igor Kudelin, 6 Zakhar Pashutin, 7 Evgeni Kisurin, 8 Dmitri Domani, 9 Valeri Tikhonenko, 10 Sergei Babkov, 11 Mikhail Mikhailov, 12 Nikita Morgunov, 13 Igor Kurashov, 14 Sergei Panov, 15 Vitaly Nosov (Coach: Sergei Belov)\n1999 EuroBasket: finished 6th among 16 teams\n4 Vasily Karasev, 5 Igor Kudelin, 6 Alexander Petrenko, 7 Evgeni Kisurin, 8 Evgeniy Pashutin, 9 Valeri Tikhonenko, 10 Sergei Babkov, 11 Igor Kurashov, 12 Zakhar Pashutin, 13 Ruslan Avleev, 14 Sergei Panov, 15 Vitaly Nosov (Coach: Sergei Belov)\n2000 Olympic Games: finished 8th among 12 teams\n4 Sergei Chikalkin, 5 Valentin Kubrakov, 6 Aleksandr Bashminov, 7 Evgeni Kisurin, 8 Nikita Morgunov, 9 Sergei Bazarevich, 10 Evgeniy Pashutin, 11 Zakhar Pashutin, 12 Andrei Fetisov, 13 Andrei Kirilenko, 14 Sergei Panov, 15 Ruslan Avleev (Coach: Stanislav Eremin)\n2001 EuroBasket: finished 5th among 16 teams\n4 Anton Ioudine, 5 Alexandre Bachminov, 6 Sergei Panov, 7 Igor Kudelin, 8 Sergei Chikalkin, 9 Nikita Morgunov, 10 Evgeniy Pashutin, 11 Zakhar Pashutin, 12 Alexander Miloserdov, 13 Andrei Kirilenko, 14 Aleksey Savrasenko, 15 Petr Samoylenko (Coach: Stanislav Eremin)\n2002 FIBA World Cup: finished 10th among 16 teams\n4 Vasily Karasev, 5 Aleksandr Bashminov, 6 Sergei Panov, 7 Igor Kudelin, 8 Sergei Chikalkin, 9 Nikita Morgunov, 10 Evgeniy Pashutin, 11 Zakhar Pashutin, 12 Victor Khryapa, 13 Andrei Kirilenko, 14 Ruslan Avleev, 15 Aleksey Savrasenko (Coach: Stanislav Eremin)\n2003 EuroBasket: finished 8th among 16 teams\n4 Vasily Karasev, 5 Denis Ershov, 6 Fedor Likholitov, 7 Mikhail Soloviev, 8 Valentin Kubrakov, 9 Petr Samoylenko, 10 Victor Khryapa, 11 Zakhar Pashutin, 12 Sergei Monia, 13 Andrei Kirilenko, 14 Dmitri Domani, 15 Aleksey Savrasenko (Coach: Sergei Elevich)\n2005 EuroBasket: finished 8th among 16 teams\n4 Anton Ponkrashov, 5 J.R.

The team is organised by the Costa Rica Cricket Federation, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002 and an associate member in 2017. Costa Rica's first recorded international match came in April 2002, when it toured Panama and played against the Panamanian national side. The team's first international tournament was the inaugural edition of the Central American Championships, played in Belize in 2006. It has since regularly fielded teams in that tournament, and also made its debut in ICC Americas tournaments in 2010, at the 2010 Division Four event in Mexico.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Costa Rica and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the T20I status.\nHistory.\nCricket was introduced in Costa Rica during the late 1800s by Jamaican immigrants coming to construct the country's railways. The sport continued to be played among the Afro-Caribbean population in the Caribbean coastal areas but its popularity began to decline. In recent years, however, more Costa Ricans are being introduced to the game and interest in the game is starting to grow.\nCosta Rica became an affiliate member of the ICC in 2002. Their first international match was played on 18 March 2006 in the Central American Cricket Championship against Belize to whom they lost. They also lost their game against Mexico finishing third in the tournament.\nCosta Rica also took part in the 2007 Central American Cricket Championship, losing to Mexico but recording their first international win against El Salvador and finishing second in the competition.\nIn 2008, Costa Rica took part in the inaugural Easter Cup, an international Twenty20 tournament, against hosts Nicaragua and El Salvador. Costa Rica dominated the tournament defeating both of the other sides. The second Easter Cup was held in the December of the same year. Costa Rica finished third beating El Salvador but losing to Belize.\nThe following year, Costa Rica took part in the third Central American Championship, which they also hosted. They finished fourth out of the five participating teams. Their only win in the new Twenty20 format was against El Salvador who they beat by 10 wickets.\nThe official site for the Costa Rican cricket organisation can be found at http://www.costaricacricket.org\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members.

        "text": "The Croatia national cricket team is the team that represents Croatia in international cricket. The team is organised by the Croatian Cricket Federation, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2001 and an associate member in 2017. Croatia made its international debut at the 2000 ECC Representative Festival in Austria. It has since regularly played in the lower levels of European Cricket Council tournaments, as well as in various other series against European sides.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Croatia and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the T20I status.\nInternational competition.\nCroatia have been a regular participant in the European Cricket Council's various tournaments, starting in 2000 with the ECC Representative Championships, the fourth tier of European competition. They finished as runners up to Norway in that tournament. They hosted the same tournament two years later, where they finished third behind Finland and Slovenia, but then won the 2004 tournament.\nICC Europe one-day tournaments.\nThey also competed in the ECC Trophy in 2001, 2003 but failed to achieve results they were capable of and finished just off the bottom of the ladder on both occasions.\nIn 2004 ICC Europe reorganised its competition structure, creating four divisions – of which Croatia fell into Division 4. The team made a clean sweep of the ICC Europe Division 4 Championship held that year in Ljubljana, Slovenia, beating the hosts Slovenia, newcomers Bulgaria and old rivals in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Finland. Victory meant automatic promotion to Division 3.\nThe team's first appearance in the 9-team Division 3, held in Belgium in August 2005, was successful from the point of view that they managed to finish in 7th place and thereby avoid the two bottom two places which meant automatic relegation back to the lower division whence they came, as ICC Europe restructured its competitions again, this time creating 5 divisions of six nations each, European Championship. The team returned to Belgium in 2007 for another crack at Division 3. This time they were better prepared and organised, and despite a number of injuries went through the tournament undefeated after narrowly beating Spain (by 4 runs) in a thrilling final – to earn the right to play against Israel for a place in the dizzy heights of Division 2.\nIn another close finish the team beat Israel by 5 runs in Tel Aviv in November to earn a spot in Division 2, which was played in Guernsey in 2008. The step-up in standard of the higher division proved a little too much and the team left the island without a victory in the competition, and the prospect of another play-off match to avoid relegation back to Division 3.\nCroatia narrowly defeated Israel by 5 runs in Tel Aviv in November 2007 in a play-off match for the sixth place in the European Division 2 Championship. This match shall be recorded in history as the first official international cricket match played in Israel since the formation of the modern Israeli state.\nIn October 2009 Croatia and Israel met again for a play-off match to decide who will fill the sixth spot in the ICC Europe Division 2 Championship to be played in 2010. Israel ran out comfortable winners in a rain-affected match played in Zagreb. Croatia now returns to ICC Europe Division 3, and will take part in the championship in 2011.\nICC Europe Twenty20 competitions.\nThe Croatian Cricket Federation also sent a representative side (Croatia 'A') to take part in the 2008 Euro Twenty-20 tournament held by Carmel &amp; District Cricket Club in North Wales. Croatia recorded victories over Slovakia and Carmel but lost in the semi-finals to eventual winners Estonia, to finish in fourth spot.\nThe Croatia 'A' team returned to Carmel in July 2009 for the second edition of the Euro Twenty-20 tournament. This time team beat Bulgaria but lost to the Isle of Alderney and Russia in the group stage to be relegated to the 'Plate' competition. Victories against Hungary in the semi-final and New Victoria CC in the Plate final gave the team its first silverware. Croatia A's Nikola Davidović was also named the bowler of the tournament.\nCroatia 'A' played a friendly match against Ireland 'A' in Dublin on 19 July 2009. Ireland ran out comfortable winners by 133 runs.\nMCC Tour of August 2009.\nThe MCC toured Croatia from 2 August until 7 August, the first match commencing on 3 August between a Croatian Development XI and the MCC (Limited Overs), the match was a 75 run win to the visitors (MCC 8/280 v Croatia 5/205), a notable performance by C.Sinovich scoring 116 with the bat and taking 1 for 53 off 7 overs. The second match, on 4 August, was between the MCC and Croatian Presidents XI (Twenty20), the result was a dismal performance by the Croatian team, losing the match by 127 runs (MCC 2/264 v Croatia 5/137), R Turner top scoring for the visitors with 179, putting together a partnership with M.Marvell of 251 for the second wicket. V. Sharma was the only notable performer for Croatia with figures of 1 for 22 off 4 overs. For the fourth match of the series (played on 5 August), the MCC played a Croatian national team (Limited Overs) who made 9/187 off their allotted overs, but losing by 6 wickets, MCC reaching 4/188 off 27.3 overs. C.Wear top scoring for the locals with 62 (second highest for the match behind T.Hicks with 84).

        "title": "Boxing styles and technique",
        "text": "Throughout the history of gloved boxing styles, techniques and strategies have changed to varying degrees. Ring conditions, promoter demands, teaching techniques, and the influence of successful boxers are some of the reasons styles and strategies have fluctuated.\nBoxing Styles.\nThe Four Main Categories.\nEvery boxer falls into one of the four following styles: pressure fighters, out-boxer, brawler, and boxer-puncher. While there are many different sub-categories for these styles, all boxers can be classified by one of the four main styles. \nPressure Fighter.\nAlso known as swarmers, in-fighters or crowders, pressure fighters fight very aggressively and in close-quarters. This style involves bombarding the opponent with attacks to prevent effective counters and wearing down the opponent's defenses by attrition. Notably, a pressure fighter is identified by their forward movement, prioritizing their positioning at the edge of their opponent's range above achieving a favorable position in the ring. Boxers using this style consistently stay within or at the edge of the punching range of their opponent, forcing their opponent to engage 'on the back foot,' either retreating or attempting counter punches. This tends to require a large investment of energy (cardio) on the part of both fighters, meaning one goal of an effective pressure fighter is to exhaust their opponent. Pressure fighters rely heavily on an understanding of positioning, more commonly referred to as 'footwork,' to continually present a threat to their opponent while simultaneously paying attention to defensive concerns. Pressure fighters typically also rely on head movement and clinching as these forms of defense serve both offensive and defensive purposes from the closer ranges required for the style.\nPressure fighters tend to enter engagements methodically. They prioritize initiating engagements, usually by entering their opponent's punching range using a combination of footwork, feints and straight punches or uppercuts. Once inside of their opponent's range, their objective is to score (land punches), then quickly exit the engagement - ideally at the very edge of their opponent's punching range. A boxer may also exert pressure by initiating a clinch instead of exiting the engagement after punching while fighting in very close quarters. Ideally, the pressure fighter will seek to leverage their weight over their opponent in the clinch, forcing their opponent to expend energy holding the pressure fighter's weight.\nSuccessful pressure fighters tend to have a good \"chin\", as this style involves entering the punching range of their opponent before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. Pressure fighters are often either fighters of smaller stature or fighters with shorter reaches, as these fighters more frequently have to get inside of their opponent's punching range to land punches, though this is not a rule and there are examples of pressure fighters of all sizes and body types.\nCommonly known pressure fighters are:\nOut-boxer.\nThe out-boxer (out-fighter, boxer) seeks to stay well outside of their opponent's punching range when disengaged and land long-range punches. This style can be seen as an inverse of pressure fighting. Out-boxers are known for quick movement and an emphasis on optimal positioning in the ring, known as 'ringcraft' or 'ring generalship.' Since these fighters rely on punches from long range, the focus of these fighters tends to be obtaining a favorable position using footwork and feints, then using the threat of these punches to draw counters from their opponent or else corral their opponents into unfavorable positions along the ropes or in the corner of the ring, thus making the opponent's movements much easier to anticipate. Using positioning outside of the opponent's range, a successful out-boxer will score using their jab and attempt to anticipate their opponent's response, applying an appropriate counter.\nOut-boxers rely on the defensive advantages given to them by staying outside of their opponents punching range. Their opponent is forced to initiate engagements from this range, and a successful out-boxer will attempt to reduce possible responses of their opponent using feints and footwork - in particular, achieving a favorable 'angle,' where the opponent is within the out-boxer's punching range while the out-boxer is outside of theirs. An out-boxers style is often typified by speed and a focus on accurate punches over knockout blows.\nOut-boxers are generally taller fighters with long reach, as these fighters tend to be more able to threaten punches from outside of their opponent's range.\nCommonly known out-boxers are:\nBrawler.\nIf the out-boxer represents everything elegant about boxing, the brawler (slugger, puncher) embodies everything brutal and ruthless about the sport. Offensively, they possess the best balance and knockout capabilities due to their tendency to plant their feet on the ground while fighting. The most elite sluggers can punch with power from every angle. Some have the ability to corner their opponents to ensure they fall prey to their devastating punches. When it comes to defense, they smother their opponents and leave them vulnerable to power-punches. At the same time, they tend to be the masters of defensive movement in the danger zone of being punched. They apply subtle defensive movements, such as slipping and minimal ducking to reduce the damage they take in punching zones.\nMost brawlers lack mobility in the ring and may have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet but that is not always the case. Compared to swarmers and out-boxers, brawlers normally throw power shots and rely less on combinations. Brawlers often throw predictable punching patterns (single punches with obvious leads) which can leave them open for counterpunching.\nCommonly known brawlers are:\nBoxer-puncher.\nThe boxer-puncher possesses many of the qualities of the out-boxer: hand speed, often an outstanding jab combination, and/or counter-punching skills, better defense and accuracy than a brawler, while possessing brawler-type power. The boxer-puncher may also be more willing to fight in an aggressive swarmer-style than an out-boxer. In general the boxer-puncher lacks the mobility and defensive expertise of the pure boxer. They are the most unpredictable among all 4 boxing styles. They don't fit in the rock-paper-scissors theory, so how the fight plays out between this style and other styles tends to be unpredictable. A boxer-puncher's ability to mix things up may prove to be a hindrance to any of the three other boxing styles, but at the same time their versatility means that they tend to be a master of none.\nCommonly known boxer-punchers are:\nSub-Styles and Other Categories.\nCounterpuncher.\nA counterpuncher utilizes techniques that require the opposing boxer to make a mistake, and then capitalizing on that mistake. A skilled counterpuncher can utilize such techniques as winning rounds with the jab or psychological tactics to entice an opponent to fall into an aggressive style that will exhaust him and leave him open for counterpunches. Counterpunchers actively look for opportunities to bait an opponent into becoming too aggressive in order to capitalise on openings. Counterpunching can also be found in any of the 4 main boxing styles as it is not involved with range/distance but rather with the mentality of making an opponent miss and as a result making them pay. They are in the middle of offense and defence. As such, Muhammad Ali can be considered a counterpuncher even if he was an \"outboxer\", Tyson and Sugar Ray Robinson as well, despite the former being a \"swarmer\" and the latter a \"boxerpuncher\". For these reasons this form of boxing balances defense and offense but can lead to severe damage if the boxer who utilizes this technique has bad reflexes or is not quick enough.\nCommonly known counterpunchers are:\nPeek-a-Boo — a counter-offense style often used by a fighter where the hands are placed in front of the boxer's face, like in the babies' game of the same name. It offers extra protection to the face and makes it easier to jab the opponent's face. Peek-a-Boo boxing was developed by legendary trainer Cus D'Amato. Peek‐a‐Boo boxing utilizes relaxed hands with the forearms in front of the face and the fist at nose‐eye level. Other unique features includes side to side head movements, bobbing, weaving and blind siding your opponent. The number system e.g. 3-2-3-Body-head-body or 3-3-2 Body-Body-head is drilled with the stationary dummy and on the bag until the fighter is able to punch by rapid combinations with what D'Amato called \"bad intentions.\" The theory behind the style is that when combined with effective bobbing and weaving head movement, the fighter has a very strong offense, defense and becomes more elusive, able to throw hooks and uppercuts with great effectiveness. Also it allows swift neck movements as well as quick ducking and strong returning damage, usually by rising uppercuts or even rising hooks. Since it is a defense designed for close range fighting, it is mainly used by in-fighters. Bobo Olson was the first known champion to use this as a defense.\nIn relation to the physical requirements of this style, a fighter is advised to have very strong and explosive legs. This is because of the sheer amount of bobbing and weaving. Since a fighter closes the gap with an opponent, they must be constantly moving in order to be able to find counters. If they stagnate, they are left in a very vulnerable position, able to be \"outboxed\" by long range fighters.\nCommonly known Peek-A-Boo fighters include:\nSouthpaw.\nA southpaw fights with a left-handed fighting stance as opposed to an orthodox fighter who fights right-handed. Orthodox fighters lead and jab from their left side, and southpaw fighters will jab and lead from their right side. Orthodox fighters hook more with their left and cross more with their right, and vice versa for southpaw fighters. Some naturally right-handed fighters (such as Marvin Hagler and Michael Moorer) have converted to southpaw in the past to offset their opponents.\nCommonly known southpaw fighters are:\nSwitch-hitter.\nA switch-hitter switches back and forth between a right-handed (orthodox) stance and a left-handed (southpaw) stance on purpose to confuse their opponents in a fight. Right-handed boxers would train in the left-handed (southpaw) stance, while southpaws would train in a right-handed (orthodox) stance, gaining the ability to switch back and forth after much training. A truly ambidextrous boxer can naturally fight in the switch-hitter style without as much training.\nCommonly known switch-hitters are:\nEquipment and safety.\nBoxing techniques utilize very forceful strikes with the hand. There are many bones in the hand, and striking surfaces without proper technique can cause serious hand injuries. Today, most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without hand/wrist wraps and gloves. Handwraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not utilize them.\nHeadgear protects against cuts, scrapes, and swelling, but does not protect very well against concussions. Headgear does not sufficiently protect the brain from the jarring that occurs when the head is struck with great force. Also, most boxers aim for the chin on opponents, and the chin is usually not padded. Thus, a powerpunch can do a lot of damage to a boxer, and even a jab that connects to the chin can cause damage, regardless of whether or not headgear is being utilized.\nStances.\nIn a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with their legs shoulder-width apart and their rear foot a half-step in front of the lead foot. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the \"textbook\" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. In order to retain their stance boxers take 'the first step in any direction with the foot already leading in that direction.'\nDifferent stances allow for bodyweight to be differently positioned and emphasised; this may in turn alter how powerfully and explosively a type of punch can be delivered. For instance, a crouched stance allows for the bodyweight to be positioned further forward over the lead left leg. If a lead left hook is thrown from this position, it will produce a powerful springing action in the lead leg and produce a more explosive punch. This springing action could not be generated effectively, for this punch, if an upright stance was used or if the bodyweight was positioned predominately over the back leg. The preparatory positioning of the bodyweight over the bent lead leg is also known as an isometric preload.\nLeft-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The southpaw stance, conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.\nNorth American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.\nPunching.\nThe four basic punches in modern boxing are the jab, the cross, the hook, and the uppercut.\nDefense.\nBob and Weave — bobbing moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer \"weaves\" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the outside\". To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the inside\".\nParry/Block — parrying or blocking uses the boxer's hands as defensive tools to deflect incoming attacks. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer delivers a sharp, lateral, open-handed blow to the opponent's wrist or forearm, redirecting the punch.\nThe Cover‐up – covering up is the last opportunity to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches \"roll\" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.\nThe Clinch – clinching is a rough form of grappling and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to hold or \"tie up\" the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or uppercuts. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. Clinching is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee.\nThere are 3 main defensive positions (guards or styles) used in boxing:\nAll fighters have their own variations to these styles. Some fighters may have their guard higher for more head protection while others have their guard lower to provide better protection against body punches. Many fighters don't strictly use a single position, but rather adapt to the situation when choosing a certain position to protect them.\nPeek-a-Boo — a defense style often used by a fighter where the hands are placed in front of the boxer's face, like in the babies' game of the same name. It offers extra protection to the face and makes it easier to jab the opponent's face. Peek-a-Boo boxing was developed by legendary trainer Cus D'Amato. Peek‐a‐Boo boxing utilizes relaxed hands with the forearms in front of the face and the fist at nose‐eye level. Other unique features includes side to side head movements, bobbing, weaving and blind siding your opponent. The number system e.g. 3-2-3-Body-head-body or 3-3-2 Body-Body-head is drilled with a stationary dummy called the \"Willie bag\", named by Cus after boxer Willie Pastrano, until the fighter is able to punch rapid combinations with what D'Amato called \"bad intentions.\" The theory behind the style is that when combined with effective bobbing and weaving head movement, the fighter has a very strong defense and becomes more elusive, able to throw hooks and uppercuts with great effectiveness. Also it allows swift neck movements as well quick duckings and bad returning damage, usually by rising uppercuts or even rising hooks. Since it is a defense designed for close range fighting, it is mainly used by in-fighters. Bobo Olson was the first known champion to use this as a defense.\nCommonly known Peek-A-Boo fighters include:\nCross-armed — the forearms are placed on top of each other horizontally in front of the face with the glove of one arm being on the top of the elbow of the other arm. This style is greatly varied when the back hand (right for an orthodox fighter and left for a southpaw) rises vertically. This style is the most effective for reducing head damage. The only head punch that a fighter is susceptible to is a jab to the top of the head. The body is open, but most fighters who use this style bend and lean to protect the body, but while upright and unaltered the body is there to be hit. This position is very difficult to counterpunch from, but virtually eliminates all head damage.\nCommonly known Cross-Armed fighters include:\nPhilly Shell or Shoulder Roll — this is actually a variation of the cross-arm. The lead arm (left for an orthodox fighter and right for a southpaw) is placed across the torso usually somewhere in between the belly button and chest and the lead hand rests on the opposite side of the fighter's torso. The back hand is placed on the side of the face (right side for orthodox fighters and left side for southpaws). The lead shoulder is brought in tight against the side of the face (left side for orthodox fighters and right side for southpaws). This style is used by fighters who like to counterpunch. To execute this guard a fighter must be very athletic and experienced. This style is so effective for counterpunching because it allows fighters to slip punches by rotating and dipping their upper body and causing blows to glance off the fighter. After the punch glances off, the fighter's back hand is in perfect position to hit their out‐of‐position opponent. The shoulder lean is used in this stance. To execute the shoulder lean a fighter rotates and ducks (to the right for orthodox fighters and to the left for southpaws) when their opponents punch is coming towards them and then rotates back towards their opponent while their opponent is bringing their hand back. The fighter will throw a punch with their back hand as they are rotating towards their undefended opponent. The weakness to this style is that when a fighter is stationary and not rotating they are open to be hit so a fighter must be athletic and well conditioned to effectively execute this style. To beat this style, fighters like to jab their opponents shoulder causing the shoulder and arm to be in pain and to demobilize that arm. But if mastered and perfected it is an effective way to play defense in the sport of boxing.\nCommonly known Philly Shell fighters include:"

        "text": "The Bosnia and Herzegovina men's national basketball team (Bosnian: \"Košarkaška reprezentacija Bosne i Hercegovine\" / Кошаркашка репрезентација Босне и Херцеговине) represents Bosnia and Herzegovina in international basketball competitions, and is governed by the Basketball Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Until 1992, Bosnian basketballers played for Yugoslavia.\nBosnia and Herzegovina reached their first international tournament at the EuroBasket in 1993. They have competed ten times at the event overall. The team has yet to qualify on the global level to play at the FIBA World Cup.\nHistory.\nUntil 1992, Bosnia and Herzegovina was a part of Yugoslavia, which meant players born in Bosnia and Herzegovina played for the Yugoslavia national team. Between 1947 and 1992, the following Bosnia-born players were selected to play for the Yugoslavia national team at the biggest competitions (Olympics, World Cup, and EuroBasket) at least once: Mirza Delibašić, Dražen Dalipagić, Predrag Danilović, Zoran Savić, Ratko Radovanović, Borislav Stanković, Milan Bjegojević, Dragiša Vučinić, Sabit Hadžić, Emir Mutapčić, and Mario Primorac. During this time, Bosnia and Herzegovina's capital city, Sarajevo, was one of five locations where games were played during the 1970 FIBA World Cup; where Yugoslavia finished in first place, the team's first gold medal at the FIBA World Cup.\nAfter gaining its independence from Yugoslavia, Bosnia and Herzegovina qualified to the EuroBasket for the first time in 1993. Entering the tournament, Bosnia and Herzegovina earned their first ever EuroBasket victory in their final Group A match against Sweden. The team would go on to make it to the quarter-finals before losing to the eventual bronze medalists Croatia, which sent the team into the classification phase to finish out the competition.\nAfter a positive showing for the national team in their first EuroBasket appearance, they would fail to qualify for the tournament in 1995. However, Bosnia and Herzegovina would turn around to qualify for the continental showpiece five consecutive times (1997, 1999, 2001, 2003, 2005). Although after that stretch for the national team, they would only qualify for the Euros three times after 2005 until 2015. Heading toward qualification for EuroBasket 2017, Bosnia and Herzegovina came up short in their attempt to qualify to the EuroBasket for the first time since 2009.\nFor qualification to reach the 2019 FIBA World Cup, Bosnia and Herzegovina first went through European Pre-Qualifiers, where the team won four out of their six matches (4–2) to advance. Entering the first round of the qualifiers, the national team earned a tough win at home against Russia 81–76. After the win, Bosnia and Herzegovina would pull out one more victory during the rest of the first round of qualifying to position itself to advance. In the second and final round of 2019 World Cup qualifying, the team lost its first five matches by single digits before defeating Bulgaria. However, the five crucial losses ultimately eliminated the team from clinching qualification.\nIn 2022, Bosnia and Herzegovina were set to play in the EuroBasket 2022 but were in danger on missing out on the tournament due to a lack of funds, just weeks before the start. Eventually, the federation received 150,000 convertible marks in financial aid from the Bosnian government, to ensure participation in the tournament.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the EuroBasket 2025 Qualifiers matches on 23 and 26 February 2024 against Cyprus and France.\nNotable players.\nCurrent notable players who have played for the national team:\nPast rosters.\n1993 EuroBasket: finished 8th among 16 teams\n4 Samir Selešković, 5 Gordan Firić, 6 Adis Bećiragić, 8 Senad Begović, 9 Ilijas Masnić, 10 Mario Primorac, 11 Samir Avdić,&lt;br&gt;12 Emir Mutapčić, 13 Emir Halimić, 14 Sabahudin Bilalović (Coach: Ibrahim Krehić)\n1997 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 16 teams\n4 Nenad Marković, 5 Gordan Firić, 6 Adis Bećiragić, 7 Samir Lerić, 8 Azur Korlatović, 9 Sejo Bukva, 10 Samir Selešković,&lt;br&gt;11 Samir Avdić, 12 Elvir Ovčina, 13 Dževad Alihodžić, 14 Adnan Hodžić, 15 Haris Mujezinović (Coach: Sabit Hadžić)\n1999 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 16 teams\n4 Nenad Marković, 5 Gordan Firić, 6 Adis Bećiragić, 7 Samir Lerić, 8 Ivan Opačak, 9 Jasmin Hukić, 10 Damir Mirković, 11 Tarik Valjevac,&lt;br&gt;12 Dževad Alihodžić, 13 Elvir Ovčina, 15 Haris Mujezinović (Coach: Sabit Hadžić)\n2001 EuroBasket: finished 13th among 16 teams\n4 Nenad Marković, 5 Gordan Firić, 6 Goran Terzić, 7 Samir Lerić, 8 Ivan Opačak, 9 Jasmin Hukić, 10 Siniša Kovačević, 11 Bariša Krasić,&lt;br&gt;12 Damir Mršić, 13 Ramiz Suljanović, 14 Elvir Ovčina, 15 Haris Mujezinović (Coach: Sabit Hadžić)\n2003 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 16 teams\n4 Terrel Castle, 5 Elvir Ovčina, 6 Damir Krupalija, 7 Samir Lerić, 8 Želimir Stevanović, 9 Jasmin Hukić, 10 Siniša Kovačević,&lt;br&gt;11 Bariša Krasić, 12 Damir Mršić, 13 Kenan Bajramović, 14 Mirza Teletović, 15 Haris Mujezinović (Coach: Draško Prodanović)\n2005 EuroBasket: finished 15th among 16 teams\n4 Vedran Princ, 5 Elvir Ovčina, 6 Mirza Teletović, 7 Samir Lerić, 8 Edin Bavčić, 9 Henry Domercant, 10 Siniša Kovačević,&lt;br&gt;11 Mujo Tuljković, 12 Damir Mršić, 13 Jasmin Hukić, 14 Aleksandar Radojević, 15 Kenan Bajramović (Coach: Mensur Bajramović)\n2011 EuroBasket: finished 19th among 24 teams\n4 Nemanja Gordić, 5 Aleksej Nešović, 6 Ermin Jazvin, 7 Goran Ikonić, 8 Milan Milošević, 9 Edin Bavčić, 10 Saša Vasiljević,&lt;br&gt;11 Elmedin Kikanović, 12 Mirza Teletović, 13 Henry Domercant, 14 Nihad Đedović, 15 Kenan Bajramović (Coach: Sabit Hadžić)\n2013 EuroBasket: finished 12th among 24 teams\n4 Muhamed Pašalić, 5 Ante Mašić, 6 Andrija Stipanović, 7 Marko Šutalo, 8 Zack Wright, 9 Edin Bavčić, 10 Nemanja Gordić,&lt;br&gt;11 Elmedin Kikanović, 12 Mirza Teletović, 13 Dalibor Peršić, 14 Nihad Đedović, 15 Nedžad Sinanović (Coach: Aleksandar Petrović)\n2015 EuroBasket: finished 23rd among 24 teams\n4 Muhamed Pašalić, 5 Nedim Buza, 6 Andrija Stipanović, 7 Marko Šutalo, 9 Edin Bavčić, 10 Nemanja Gordić, 11 Elmedin Kikanović (C),&lt;br&gt;13 Dalibor Peršić, 15 Milan Milošević, 20 Alex Renfroe, 23 Adin Vrabac, 30 Draško Albijanić (Coach: Duško Ivanović)\n2022 EuroBasket: finished 18th among 24 teams\n0 Jusuf Nurkić, 2 John Roberson, 5 Edin Atić, 7 Miralem Halilović (C), 9 Amar Gegić, 11 Kenan Kamenjaš, 12 Sani Čampara,&lt;br&gt;13 Džanan Musa, 15 Ajdin Penava, 17 Aleksandar Lazić, 22 Emir Sulejmanović, 27 Adin Vrabac (Coach: Adis Bećiragić)"

        "text": "Patrick James \"Whitey\" Stapleton (July 4, 1940 – April 8, 2020) was a Canadian ice hockey player. A defenceman, Stapleton played 15 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and the World Hockey Association (WHA), most notably for the Chicago Black Hawks. He was the father of Mike Stapleton, who had a lengthy career in the NHL.\nPlaying career.\nStapleton played Junior B hockey with the Sarnia Legionnaires before spending two seasons with the St. Catharines Teepees of the Ontario Hockey Association, winning the Memorial Cup in 1960. With the Legionnaires he won two Western Jr. 'B' championships and one Sutherland Cup as an all-Ontario champion. Although he was a defenceman, he led the Legionnaires in scoring during his second season.\nHis first full season was with the Sault Thunderbirds of the Eastern Professional Hockey League in 1960–61. Stapleton had signed with the Chicago Black Hawks, but was claimed by the Boston Bruins in the intra-league draft in June 1961 and began his National Hockey League career with the Bruins in the 1961–62 season. The next year, he split his time between Bruins and their EPHL affiliate, the Kingston Frontenacs. Stapleton spent the next two years in the minor leagues, playing with the Portland Buckaroos of the Western Hockey League. He received the Hal Laycoe Cup as the WHL's top defenceman for the 1964–65 season.\nStapleton was briefly the property of the Toronto Maple Leafs in June 1965 as part of a trade with the Bruins, but he was left unprotected in the intra-league draft and was claimed the next day by the Chicago Black Hawks. Wearing number 7, he played some games with the Hawks' Central Hockey league affiliate, the St. Louis Braves, in 1965–66, but they would be the final minor league games of his career. Stapleton remained in the NHL for eight seasons with the Black Hawks, and was named Second Team All-Star three times (1966, 1971, and 1972). Stapleton played with the Black Hawks in the Stanley Cup finals in 1971 and 1973. His highest scoring season was 1969, where his 50 assists set a new NHL record for assists in a season by a defenceman (broken the next year by Bobby Orr).\nStapleton was a member of the Team Canada team at the Summit Series in 1972. During the tournament he was a +6 and was often paired with his Black Hawks teammate Bill White. It is believed that Stapleton is the owner of the puck used by Paul Henderson to score the series-winning goal. Stapleton himself admits that he does not know which one of the hundreds of pucks he owns is that game winning one, though it is in his possession.\nIn 1973, Stapleton jumped from the NHL and signed a five-year deal with the Chicago Cougars of the World Hockey Association (WHA) where he became player-coach, replacing Marcel Pronovost as coach. He was a WHA first-team all-star in 1974 and won the Dennis A. Murphy Trophy as the league's top defenceman in the 1973–74 season.\nStapleton again represented Canada in the 1974 Summit Series against the national team from the Soviet Union, this time as team captain, recording three assists in eight games. He was again player-coach of the Cougars in 1974–75, and the team struggled on the ice and financially. In December 1974, he and teammates Dave Dryden and Ralph Backstrom bought the troubled franchise. At the time, Stapleton also owned two small arenas in the Chicago area along with other business interests.\nThe Cougars folded after the 1974–75 season and Stapleton was claimed by the Indianapolis Racers, where he played for two seasons and was named a second-team all-star in 1976. When the Racers refused to honour his contract in 1977, Stapleton was transferred to the Cincinnati Stingers, where he played one season before retiring in 1978. Over his career, Stapleton scored 337 points in the NHL and 239 in the WHA.\nRetirement.\nStapleton lived in Strathroy, Ontario and was a member of the advisory board of the Junior B Strathroy Rockets of the Western Ontario Junior Hockey League. He has a Strathroy and District Hockey Association award named after him.\nIn 2008, Stapleton brought the puck that Paul Henderson fired into the net to win the 1972 Summit Series with the Russians to a Sarnia Legionnaires game. He dropped it at a ceremonial faceoff being held to honour Legionnaire founder Tommy Norris. He told the \"Sarnia Observer\" that he had the puck on his stick when the buzzer sounded to end the series. He was about to shoot it down the ice when he suddenly paused and picked it up. In May 2010, Stapleton told the \"Toronto Sun\" that he would hang onto the puck until the 40th Anniversary of the Summit Series in 2012.\nStapleton died on April 8, 2020, at the age of 79.\nOn September 10, 2022, the Sarnia Arena was renamed Pat Stapleton Arena in his honour. The ribbon was cut by his widow, Jackie and his son, Mike Stapleton, addressed the crowd “As a family, we’re deeply honoured to have a rink named after dad. I’m sure he’s looking down from hockey heaven pretty happy.\"\nIn 2005, he was inducted into Canada's Sports Hall of Fame as a member of Team Canada in the 1972 Canada - USSR Summit Series. In 2010, he was elected as an inaugural inductee into the World Hockey Association Hall of Fame."

He is best known for his time with the Edmonton Oilers, where he spent most of his career and won five Stanley Cups, in 1984, 1985, 1987, 1988 and 1990.\nEarly life.\nGregg was born in Edmonton. He attended the University of Alberta to work toward a medical degree, and playing hockey was a secondary priority. However, he became one of the top players in Canadian university hockey, leading the Golden Bears to two Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union (CIAU) championships, and was CIAU Player of the Year in 1979. \nCareer.\nGregg received a contract offer from the New York Rangers but rejected it to spend the year with David Bauer and the Canadian national team, and captained Canada's entry at the 1980 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid.\nFollowing the 1980 Olympics, Gregg signed in Japan as a player-coach and spent two full seasons playing there. He was at last convinced to accept an NHL offer by his hometown Edmonton Oilers, and joined the team for the 1982 playoffs, appearing in four games.\nIn 1982–83, Gregg emerged as a regular on the Oilers' blueline, appearing in all 80 games and registering 6 goals and 28 points. Receiving as much notoriety from the fact that he had a medical degree as he did for his solid play on the blueline, he helped the Oilers reach the Stanley Cup finals in 1983. In 1983–84, he would have his finest NHL season, as he recorded career highs of 12 goals and 40 points, and then contributed 10 points in 19 playoff games to help Edmonton win their first Stanley Cup. Following the season, he was selected to represent Canada at the 1984 Canada Cup tournament.\nGregg retired after the Oilers' disappointing loss in the 1986 playoffs but returned to the team six weeks into the season and helped Edmonton win their third championship in 1986–87. He retired from professional hockey again after the 1987–88 campaign to enter a residency program in orthopedic surgery and Canada at the 1988 Winter Olympics, but re-joined Edmonton for the playoffs to win another Stanley Cup.\nGregg spent two more years with the Oilers as a depth defender, helping the team win their fifth Stanley Cup in seven years in 1990. He was one of seven players to play for all five championship teams. Exposed in the 1990 NHL Waiver Draft, he was claimed by the Vancouver Canucks but decided again to retire. However, after a year away from the sport, he signed with the Canucks for the 1991–92 campaign, appearing in 21 games, before retiring for good following the season.\nGregg appeared in 474 NHL games, recording 41 goals and 152 assists for 193 points along with 333 penalty minutes. He also appeared in 137 playoff games, totaling 13 goals and 40 assists for 53 points.\nFollowing his retirement, Gregg completed his residency training program at the University of Alberta Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry. He is a family physician, operating a successful sports medicine practice in Edmonton. He briefly worked at TSN as the third string color commentator for NHL games in 1994–95.\nPersonal life.\nGregg married American-born Canadian Olympic speed-skater Kathy Vogt on June 9, 1984, in Edmonton. They have four children, including speed-skaters Jessica Gregg and Jamie Gregg. Gregg and his family reside in Edmonton, Alberta. His brother, Gary, is a former member of the Edmonton Investors Group (EIG), the limited partnership that owned the Edmonton Oilers.\nLegacy.\nThe Dr. Randy Gregg Award is presented annually by Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) to reward excellence in the student-athlete. The Canadian University ice hockey player who receives this award has exhibited outstanding achievement in ice hockey, academics, and community involvement."

Johnson played college football for the Florida Gators, and thereafter, he played professionally for the Atlanta Falcons, the Jacksonville Jaguars, the Cincinnati Bengals, the Cleveland Browns, and the Tennessee Titans of the NFL. He is in the Florida Georgia Hall of Fame, and played in minor league baseball for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays organization.\nEarly years.\nJohnson was born in Gainesville, Florida in 1977. He attended in Buchholz High School in Gainesville, where he was a stand-out high school football and baseball player for the Buchholz Bobcats.\nCollege career.\nJohnson accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, where he was a quarterback for coach Steve Spurrier's Gators teams from 1996 to 1999. Memorably, Johnson threw for 460 yards and seven touchdowns against the Central Michigan Chippewas in 1997, setting a Southeastern Conference (SEC) record for most touchdown passes in a game, and an NCAA Division I record for most touchdown passes in a half. In three seasons as the Gators' principal starter, he threw for 7,114 yards, sixty-two touchdowns and thirty-six interceptions, completing 504 of 907 attempts, and was selected as a team captain as a senior.\nProfessional career.\nAfter graduating from Florida, Johnson was not selected in the 2000 NFL Draft, but signed with the Atlanta Falcons as a free agent. As an Atlanta Falcon in 2002, Johnson led the team to a 17–10 victory in a start against the New York Giants. In the game, Johnson completed 19 of 25 passes for 257 yards and one passing and one rushing touchdown. In four seasons with the Falcons, he started eleven games and passed for 2,600 yards. He has since played three additional seasons, mostly as a back-up or practice squad quarterback for three different teams. On September 1, 2007, he was released by the Cincinnati Bengals after playing the preseason as a backup to Carson Palmer.\nJohnson was also a second-round draft pick in 1996 for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, playing as a third baseman in their minor league system in 1996 and 1997 before suffering a rotator cuff injury and leaving to concentrate on football full-time.\nFootball Outsiders uses the term called \"the Doug Johnson Effect,\" referring to \"part-time players who had a very good performance the previous season in only one or two games,\" as a caution against overvaluing NFL players for the next season."

In the equivalent tournament in 2005, the European Affiliates Championship, they put in a much improved performance to finish third, just missing out on promotion to Division Two of the European Championship. They played in Division Three of that tournament in 2007 and again in 2009.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Spain and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 were to have T20I status.\nHistory.\nCricket is first recorded as being played in Spain in the year 1809 by soldiers of General Lord Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington). During the Peninsular War the soldiers played the game in and around Ciudad Rodrigo, Lugo and Orense. There are many records of the game being played by visiting British land and sea forces, either among themselves or against local British expatriate communities.\nThe game entered a new era in Spain with the founding of Madrid Cricket Club in 1975. It was based at first on British and Indian players, but soon West Indian and Spanish members joined.\nIn June 1989, a National Executive Committee was formed and the first steps were taken to unify all of the cricket playing clubs in Spain.\nIn 2012 a recruiter by the name of Riccardo Engleman scored 68 not out against France in a European knock out game. Coming in at number 3, Ricky left as a hero, as his batting prowess led to numerous sponsorship and collaboration deals.\nUnfortunately, as Ricky's hair thinned, so did the endorsements and he was last seen doing a deal at Symphony AI for a senior pre sales role .

France played again in the second fixture, suffering defeat against Argentina in a controversial match which saw the referee mistakenly blow the whistle for full-time six minutes early.\nChile defeated Mexico 3–0 in the two sides' first World Cup match, before Chile eliminated France in their next game with a 1–0 victory in a match which featured the first penalty kick awarded in World Cup history, Carlos Vidal's effort was saved by French goalkeeper Alex Thépot. Argentina defeated Mexico 6–3 in the group's next match in which Guillermo Stábile scored a hat-trick on his international debut. Play concluded on 22 July 1930 with Argentina playing Chile to determine the group winner for a place in the semi-finals. Stábile added two more goals as his side won 3–1 to win the group and advance. Chile, France and Mexico were subsequently eliminated from the competition. Argentina went on to reach the final, losing 4–2 to hosts Uruguay.\nBackground.\nGroup 1 was one of four groups in the opening round of the 1930 FIFA World Cup in Uruguay. The competition featured 13 sides, split into one group of four teams and three groups of three teams. The sides would play each other on a round-robin basis with the top nation in each group advancing to the semi-finals. There was no qualification process for the competition, instead all 41 member states of governing body FIFA were invited to participate. However,\nthe choice of Uruguay as host nation resulted in most declining to participate due to costs and the length of travel involved.\nThe tournament did prove popular with teams from the Americas and 9 of the 13 participants came from the region. Three of these, Argentina, Chile and Mexico were placed into Group 1 along with one of the four European entrants, France. Argentina were one of the favourites for the tournament having reached the final of the 1928 Olympics before being beaten by Uruguay. Mexico, in contrast, were relatively unknown as their football association had only been founded three years prior to the tournament and their only international victories had come against Guatemala. France had been reluctant to enter but had been persuaded by FIFA president Jules Rimet, a Frenchman, to participate, although coach Gaston Barreau and leading player Manuel Anatol both refused to travel.\nStandings.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nMatches.\nFrance vs Mexico.\nThis was the first ever meeting between the two sides, and would be one of the two opening games of the tournament, starting at the same time as the United States against Belgium match in Group 4. France had been chosen for the opening match to mark Bastille Day the following day. There had been some snowfall prior to the start of the competition, leaving the conditions cold and wintery. France opened the scoring after 19 minutes, Lucien Laurent converting a cross from Ernest Libérati to score the first goal in World Cup history. The French goalkeeper Alex Thépot was forced off the field with injury during the first half after being kicked in the jaw during a challenge with an opposition player. With no substitutions allowed, halfback Augustin Chantrel was chosen to play in his place for the remainder of the match. Despite their man disadvantage, France extended their lead twice before half-time; Marcel Langiller made it 2–0 before André Maschinot added a third shortly before the break.\nMexico looked to push forward in the second half and were able to score their first goal of the competition when Juan Carreño finished from Dionisio Mejía's pass. However, it proved to be only a consolation goal as France scored a fourth in the final minutes of the game, Maschinot scoring his second after Langiller had played a cross into the penalty area. Mexico's Manuel and Felipe Rosas became the first brothers to play together in a World Cup during the game. The match would remain the highest scoring World Cup opening match until Germany defeated Costa Rica 4–2 in the opening game of the 2006 World Cup.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nArgentina vs France.\nUnusually, France played their next match 48 hours later, this time meeting Argentina in their opponent's first game. This was the first ever meeting between the two sides. Despite his injury in the previous game, Thépot started in goal for the French but his side suffered another injury in the opening minutes of the match when Luis Monti heavily tackled Laurent resulting in the French player spending the rest of the game limping and ineffective. The Argentinians were the stronger of the two sides and only the goalkeeping of Thépot was able to keep them from scoring for much of the game. However, his resilience came to an end in the 81st minute when Monti scored direct from a free-kick with Thépot's view blocked by his teammates assembling a wall.\nFrance immediately pushed for an equaliser with Langiller breaking through the Argentine defence in the 84th minute. However, Brazilian referee Almeida Rêgo blew his whistle to signal full-time despite having six minutes of regular time remaining. The French players immediately accosted the referee but it took several minutes for order to be restored as mounted police tried to clear celebrating Uruguyan and Argentine fans from the pitch and Roberto Cherro received treatment after fainting. Eventually, the match resumed but France were unable to find an equalising goal as the match ended 1–0.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChile vs Mexico.\nThis was the first ever meeting between the two sides. Carlos Vidal gave Chile an early advantage, scoring a low shot into the bottom corner of the net from 12 yards after only four minutes following a headed layoff by Eberardo Villalobos. Mexico appealed for a handball by Vidal but this was dismissed by referee Henri Christophe. There were numerous further chances in the first half; both sides struck the goal frame, first Chile's Guillermo Subiabre hit the crossbar with a long-range drive before Mexico's Efraín Amézcua hit the post with an effort. The Asociación Nacional de Fútbol Profesional noted that the Mexicans had surprised the Chilean side prompting manager György Orth to reorganise his team and berate his forwards.\nEarly in the second half, Chile extended their lead when Mexican defender Manuel Rosas became the first player to score an own goal in the World Cup when he inadvertently headed the ball into his own net. Rosas had been attempting to head Villalobos' throw in. Unusually, this made Rosas the youngest player ever to score at a World Cup despite doing so in the wrong goal, a record which stood until the 1958 World Cup when it was beaten by Pelé. Vidal rounded out the scoring for his side late on, scoring his second and Chile's third. The goal came from a quick breakaway by Guillermo Saavedra who ran 30 metres and passed to Tomás Ojeda, who played in Vidal to finish from four yards out.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nChile vs France.\nThis was the first ever meeting between the two sides, and served as the first part of a doubleheader at the recently completed Estadio Centenario, the centrepiece stadium for the competition which had been delayed due to construction issues. Chile started the stronger of the two sides, forcing several saves from Thépot in the French goal, and were awarded a penalty in the first half, the first in World Cup history. Vidal took the kick but his effort was saved by Thépot. France's best chance of the half came from an error by Chilean defender Guillermo Riveros but his goalkeeper Roberto Cortés managed to recover the ball from the oncoming attackers to end the danger. The French resistance was eventually broken in the 64th minute when Guillermo Subiabre headed in for Chile from a cross by Vidal. The score remained 1–0, eliminating France from the competition and giving Chile their first clean sheet in an international fixture at the 42nd attempt.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nArgentina vs Mexico.\nThis was the first ever meeting between the two sides and served as the second part of the double header after the France against Chile match played earlier in the day. With captain Manuel Ferreira having returned home to sit a law exam, Guillermo Stábile was selected in attack for Argentina to make his international debut. He led his side into an early lead, scoring twice in the opening 17 minutes either side of a goal by teammate Adolfo Zumelzú. Argentina had a chance to add a fourth five minutes later when they were awarded a penalty after a handball, but Fernando Paternoster's effort was saved by Oscar Bonfiglio. Some sources have stated that Paternoster, disagreeing with the decision to award a penalty and in the spirit of fair play, deliberately hit the ball weakly to Bonfiglio. While the referee, also conceding his decision to award the penalty was incorrect, deliberately extended his stride to measure the distance for the spot kick, leaving Paternoster four yards further away than required.\nMexico pulled a goal back shortly before half-time; Manuel Rosas became the first person to score a penalty at a World Cup when he converted his effort. Argentina added two more goals in the early stages of the second half, Francisco Varallo scored his first goal of the competition before Zumelzú scored his second two minutes later. Mexico were awarded a second penalty in the 72nd minute, Rosas' initial effort was saved by Ángel Bossio, deputising as captain in Ferreira's absence, in the Argentine goal but he always able to convert the rebound. This spurred the Mexicans on and they scored a third soon after through Roberto Gayón to bring the score to 5–3. However, Stábile completed his hat-trick shortly after to end Argentina's nerves as the match finished 6–3, eliminating Mexico.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nArgentina vs Chile.\nThis was the 18th meeting between the two sides in international competition, with Chile having never beaten Argentina in their previous fixtures. The match would determine which team would win the group and advance to the semi-finals. Stábile continued his good form from the previous match by scoring twice in the opening 15 minutes, although Chile pulled a goal back almost immediately through Subiabre. Shortly before halftime, Monti came together with Casimiro Torres, bringing down the Chilean with a heavy tackle, which led to a mass brawl between the two sides. Referee John Langenus later described the aftermath of the tackle: \"the Chilean grabbed hold of Monti's head with one hand and, with the other, delivered a vicious uppercut\". The brawl quickly spread to the rest of the teams, with Langenus noting \"All at once, every Argentinian player seemed to throw themselves upon the nearest Chilean and engage in 11 separate boxing matches\". Officials and police desperately tried to restore order and the half was eventually brought to and end with the score remaining 2–1.\nDespite the tensions in the first half, the second saw no repeat of any animosity. Argentina extended their lead in the 51st minute when Mario Evaristo scored. Bossio produced several saves to deny Chile any further goals as Argentina secured a 3–1 victory, advancing them to the semi-finals and eliminating Chile.\n&lt;onlyinclude&gt;&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;\nAftermath.\nArgentina's three victories saw them finish top of Group 1 with six points, advancing them to the semi-finals. Chile finished second with four points, France came third with two points while Mexico finished last after losing all three matches. Argentina went on to play the United States in the semi-finals, securing a comfortable 6–1 victory to reach the first World Cup final against hosts Uruguay. Despite taking a 2–1 lead, Argentina went on to lose the final 4–2. Stábile's five goals in Group 1 contributed to him winning the Golden Boot as the tournament's highest goalscorer, finishing with eight.\nFrance returned to the World Cup four years later, being defeated in the first round by Austria. Following their elimination, Chile did not player another international match for five years and would not appear at another World Cup finals until 1950. Mexico would also not return to the World Cup until 1950."

        "text": "The 1970 London-Mexico World Cup Rally was the first of two World Cup Rallies to be held and the second of four marathon rallies to be held in a nine-year period beginning with the 1968 London-Sydney Marathon. The motor rally started at Wembley Stadium in London on 19 April 1970 and finished in Mexico City on 27 May 1970, covering approximately through Europe and South America. It was won by Hannu Mikkola and Gunnar Palm, driving a Ford Escort.\nOrganisation.\nThe event was the brainchild of Wylton Dickson, possibly inspired by the earlier 1968 London-Sydney Marathon, and was to mark the fact that the 1966 FIFA World Cup had been held in London and that the upcoming 1970 FIFA World Cup was to be held in Mexico. Dickson approached the renowned British rally driver Paddy Hopkirk and together they went to \"The Daily Mirror\" for sponsorship.\nThe event was organised by members of the RAC and the MSA.\nRoute and scoring.\nThe course covered approximately through Europe, South America and Central America. Two boats were needed to convey the rally, one to cross the Atlantic Ocean from Lisbon to Rio de Janeiro and a second from Buenaventura, Colombia across the Gulf of Panama to Panama to avoid the impassable Darién Gap. Some of the principal towns and cities visited were, in order:\nThe course included many special stages, some over long. Time penalties were given for exceeding set times on the special stages, as well as for other infractions of the rules, and the cars' positions determined by the penalties awarded rather than lowest cumulative times.\nCars.\nOver one hundred cars started the event. The rules about what cars could be entered were not restrictive but due to the demanding nature of the course most competitors were conservative and used modified versions of standard models. That did not prevent there being a wide variety of cars, from Volkswagen Beetles to Rolls-Royces. There were works (officially sanctioned and prepared) entries from Ford, British Leyland and Moskvitch, and semi-works entries from Citroën.\nThe Ford team ran modified Escort Mk Is, fitted with an 1850 cc version of the crossflow Kent engine and uprated with various other parts from other Ford models. Each Ford car had two drivers. The British Leyland team entered two teams. The first team ran three Triumph 2.5PI Mark 2s, which were more powerful than the Fords but were significantly heavier; two cars carried a three-man crew, Brian Culcheth preferring to stick with a conventional two-man crew. The second Leyland team ran Austin Maxis, Austin 1800s (some badged Morris) and a lone Mini Clubman. Citroën used the venerable DS21. Moskvich used the Moskvich 412 with 1500 cc engine.\nOther cars run in the event included:\nCompetitors.\nMany rally drivers of the day entered the event, including:\nAs well as professional rally drivers, the event attracted a number of well known people, including the footballer Jimmy Greaves, who finished a very creditable sixth, and HRH Prince Michael of Kent, who failed to finish."

        "title": "Sweden national cricket team",
        "text": "The Sweden national cricket team is the team that represents Sweden in international cricket. It is organised by the Swedish Cricket Federation which has been an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1997 and an associate member since 2017. The team coach is former South African international Jonty Rhodes, who was appointed in September 2020.\nSweden made its international debut in 1993, at the European Nations Cup, and has since played regularly in the lower divisions of European Cricket Council tournaments and in other series against European teams. Sweden first hosted an ICC-approved international cricket tournament in August 2016, when the 2016 ICC Europe Division Two was played in Stockholm.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Sweden and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nHistory.\nThe first cricket club in Sweden was formed in Gothenburg in 1883; one of the founders, Erik Blidbert, had learnt the game in London, and became a natural leader for Sweden's pioneering Cricket enthusiasts. The club's full name was \"Lyckans Samfund\" (Society of Joy), a pun on the name of the local neighbourhood.\nThe first organised club of modern times called the Stockholm Cricket Club, was created in 1948 by the staff of British Embassy in Stockholm. They played against the crews of passing ships and made annual visits to Helsinki. Västerås started in the 1960s and teams from Gothenburg and Mariestad (founded by Ugandan-Indians) followed in the 1970s.\nThe Swedish Cricket Federation (SCF) was formed in 1990. The driving force behind it was \"Guttsta Wicked Cricket Club\". The Swedish Cricket Federation became a Member of the ICC in 1991. Over the years, clubs like \"Stockholms Akademiska Cricketsällskap\" set-up by students at Stockholm University in 1996, which is now one of the largest club in the country, fuelled the growth of Cricket in Sweden. Initial years, the progress was slow but the interest was there. Foreign teams also toured Sweden from time to time to keep things interesting. MCC visited Sweden in June 1999 which was one of the high points for the Cricket in the country.\nAfter becoming an affiliate member of ICC, Sweden participated in many ICC-organised tournaments. In 1997 Sweden successfully hosted its first ever ICC Europe (then ECF) tournament, an indoor tournament in Halmstad.\nIn 2011 Sweden participated and won the European Division 3 in Slovenia. The following year Sweden became runners-up in European Division 2 championship in Corfu, Greece which earned the national team a place in the European Division 1, the highest-level tournament Sweden ever played in.\nThe national club scene inspired by the achievements of the national team started taking cricket seriously and in 2012 the SCF increased its membership to 21 clubs. The newly formed Division 2 was set up the same year. In 2013, six new clubs joined the league with total numbers of players in the country then standing at around 1500. With the ICC development fund, youth cricket also got much attention with youth camps organised in the three larger cricketing regions: Stockholm, Malmö and Göteborg. All of this meant further strengthening of the club scene adding to the membership of SCF. In 2014 the SCF applied to become members of the Swedish Sports Confederation (Riksidrottsförbundet, RF). The RF accepted the application and recognized SCF as its 71st member organisation in May 2015.\n2016 was the first year the government funding was available to SCF. This helped build many new cricket facilities in the country that also made it possible to host ICC Europe WCL Division 2 tournament in Stockholm. Sweden finished runners-up in that tournament and once again gained promotion to European division 1. In 2015–16 Sweden was one of the largest receivers of refugees in Europe; many of these refugees came from cricket-playing countries. This helped form many new clubs and helped existing clubs gain new members because of government's integration initiatives. Cricket is growing at a rapid pace in Sweden and clubs exist in almost every part of the country.\nIn 2021, Sweden was among five teams excluded from the ICC T20I Championship for failing to play enough fixtures in the relevant period, an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSweden will make their T20I debut during the tour to Denmark in August 2021.\nRecords.\nInternational Match Summary — Sweden\n\"Last updated 21 May 2023\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2076.

        "text": "José Manuel Mota Matos (born March 16, 1965) is a Dominican baseball broadcaster. He currently covers the Los Angeles Dodgers on Spectrum SportsNet LA. He formerly covered the Los Angeles Angels with Bally Sports West from 2002 until his departure in 2022. He began on the Angels Spanish broadcast in 2002 and took on various roles on the English television broadcast starting in 2007. He worked alongside Amaury Pi-Gonzalez in the broadcast booth in Spanish and alongside Mark Gubicza in English. Fully bilingual, he conducts postgame interviews and often doubles as the translator for Spanish-speaking players. He served as a pre-and-postgame analyst on \"Angels Live\" and occasionally filled in as a backup play-by-play announcer for English broadcasts. He is the son of former baseball player and long-time Dodgers coach Manny Mota.\nPlaying career.\nMota attended Cal State Fullerton in Orange County on a baseball scholarship. He was drafted in the second round of the 1985 amateur draft by the Chicago White Sox. He spent time in the Texas Rangers and Los Angeles Dodgers organizations before being drafted by the Oakland Athletics in with the rule 5 draft. He was then sent to the San Diego Padres in in a three-team trade and made his major league debut in with the Padres. He later signed with the Kansas City Royals as a free agent, but only appeared in two games in .\nIn 19 games, Mota had 8 hits in 38 at-bats, resulting in a .211 batting average. He scored four runs and drove in two more.\nBroadcasting career.\nFollowing his playing career, Mota sought to work in baseball broadcasting. He was mentored by Stu Nahan, Jim Hill, and Fred Roggin, among others. Mota's first major broadcast job was a brief fill-in stint for Jaime Jarrín on the Los Angeles Dodgers Spanish broadcast.\nLos Angeles Angels.\nMota worked on the Angels' Spanish-language radio broadcasts beginning in 2002. With the team adding 50 games to their English-language television package in 2007, Mota added those games to his workload.\nMota has previous television experience as a sideline reporter, and he also filled in for Rex Hudler during his suspension in 2003. He also was a third announcer in the team's over-the-air television booth in 2004 and 2005.\nSoon after the conclusion of the 2007 season, the Angels announced that Mota would no longer work as the play-by-play announcer for television games broadcast in English as he had done during that season. His place was taken by Rory Markas, who doubled as the radio play-by-play announcer for the Angels until Markas's death on January 4, 2010. Victor Rojas would take Markas's spot. Along with partner Mark Gubicza, he would cover roughly 75 games for the Angels.\nDuring the first half of the 2021 season, Mota occasionally filled in as the English play-by-play announcer when the primary commentators, Matt Vasgersian and Daron Sutton, were unavailable due to other broadcast obligations. After Sutton was replaced mid-season by Rich Waltz, Patrick O'Neal took over Mota's de facto \"third-string\" play-by-play broadcasting role, filling in when Vasgersian was broadcasting with ESPN or MLB Network and when Waltz was broadcasting with CBS Sports. Mota returned to his more typical roles of \"Angels Live\" analysis and field-level reporting in the second half of the 2021 season.\nOn February 3, 2022, Mota announced on Instagram that he decided to depart Bally Sports West. He expressed his gratitude for the Angels organization and said he felt it was time for a \"new chapter\" but did not immediately announce his future plans.\n\"Major League Baseball on FOX\".\nMota worked for FOX on their coverage of the 2006 Major League Baseball postseason after Steve Lyons was removed from the broadcast for perceived racially insensitive remarks.\nLos Angeles Dodgers.\nIn March 2022, it was announced that Mota would join the Spectrum SportsNet LA broadcast team to cover the Los Angeles Dodgers. He was among a group of newcomers to the network that included Jessica Mendoza, Adrián González, Eric Karros, and Dontrelle Willis. \nOther ventures.\nMota has also handled several Spanish language assignments in both baseball and football for Fox Sports. Mota also did English language coverage of the 2009 Caribbean Series with Florida Marlins broadcaster Cookie Rojas, the father of eventual Angels broadcaster Victor Rojas, on MLB Network.\nMota made one film appearance, in the 1999 Kevin Costner film \"For Love of the Game\" as a Dominican shortstop.\nPersonal life.\nMota's father, Manny, was an MLB player who also spent over three decades with the Dodgers as a coach. Because of his father's involvement with the Dodgers, Mota grew up around the team's clubhouse and served as a batboy. His brother, Andy, played for the Houston Astros and now works as a player agent. His cousin, José Báez, played for the Seattle Mariners."

        "title": "Darts world rankings",
        "text": "The Darts World Rankings are systems designed to determine a list of the best darts players in the world based on their performances in past tournaments.\nIn 1993, a group of former world champions and other high-profile players separated from the British Darts Organisation, meaning there were several major governing bodies in the sport. Each organization has its own players, and each has its own ranking system.\nAfter the British Darts Organisation folded in 2020, the two main rankings are now maintained by the World Darts Federation and the Professional Darts Corporation.\nThe ranking systems are used to arrange tournament seedings, which are so arranged, that the number one player in the world will not face the number two player until the final of a tournament, providing they both reach that final.\nPDC World Rankings.\nThe Professional Darts Corporation's Ranking is based on the amount of prize money won in ranking tournaments on a two year cycle.\nWDF World rankings.\nThe rankings are based on a cumulative points system, calculated on a rolling one-year basis. When a tournament is played, the previous year's results are removed from the rankings and the new tournament scores are used. This list is used to determine seeds for some of the WDF Opens. The World Darts Federation ranking system is designed to provide a measure of the global activities of darts players in every WDF recognized darts event. It used to be very similar to the BDO system but was revised in January 2007 to include categories by country and by events, and the distribution of ranking points reflect the levels of prize money on offer and the numbers of entries in a tournament. Players gain points in six levels of categorized events and prize money and at the end of the season the leading players receive monetary bonus rewards from the WDF.\nCurrent points distribution.\n\"Points are currently awarded as follows:\"\nPrevious World Number Ones (Men's, WDF).\nThe following is a list of players who ended the year ranked number one in the WDF.\nBDO rankings.\nThe BDO Invitational Table relates only to registered playing members of the BDO, who comply with BDO and World Darts Federation (WDF) eligibility rules, including terms and conditions of the 1997 Tomlin Order.\nThe BDO awards points depending on a player's performances within each of its events and other BDO-recognised qualifying events. Forty-nine points are awarded to the champion of each of its three Major Events – The Lakeside World Professional Championship, The Bavaria World Darts Trophy and the Winmau World Masters and A+ events. Lower points are awarded for each round of the tournament reached. Other events are placed into Category A, B, C, and D based on the prize pool and number of payouts, with points for placings slowly decreasing. Only the best 12 placings are added for a player's ranking.\nFinal rankings.\nFollowing a cease in tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the BDO stopped publishing rankings on 18 March 2020. The BDO having entered liquidation in September of that year, what follows are the final published rankings by the organisation."

The national organising body in Slovenia, the Slovenian Cricket Association, became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2005 and an associate member in 2017.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Slovenia and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nHistory.\nEarly days.\nIt is thought that cricket was introduced to Slovenia in 1974, after Borut Čegovnik, then a 13-year-old boy from the mountain town of Mežica, was introduced to the sport on an extended visit to his penpal in Birchington-on-Sea, Kent. He received extensive coaching from his host's father, and went back to his home with a selection of cricket equipment having decided that cricket was just the thing for his town. Seventeen, mainly single-wicket, tournaments were held between 1974 and 1982, with 24 local boys playing. The game was played in the village until 1982, when several of the ringleaders moved to the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana.\nModern era.\nCricket resurfaced in Slovenia in 1997 when the Ljubljana Cricket Club was formed. The first game was played between a Slovenian President's XI and a visiting club from The Hague. That game was attended by the then Slovenian president Milan Kučan. Friendly games against sides from various countries and the British Embassy continued, and Ljubljana Cricket Club began to compete in Austrian club cricket.\nIn 2000, the Slovenian national cricket team made its debut in the European Representative Championships. They finished fourth in the tournament, and came second in 2002. They hosted the tournament in 2004, again finishing in fourth place. This tournament was replaced in 2006 by the Division Four of the European Championship, where Slovenia finished in fourth place out of the four teams.

        "text": "Stephen Thomas Moore (born 20 January 1983) is an Australian former rugby union footballer, who played Super Rugby for the Brumbies and Queensland Reds and has 129 caps for Australia internationally, including 24 tests as captain.\nMoore is the 14th most capped player of all time, has the second most Test appearances for Australia behind George Gregan and is the only Australian hooker to have played 100 Tests. He is also the most capped Australian Super Rugby player of all time, and is one only two players in Australian Rugby history, along with Nathan Sharpe to have achieved 100 Test and 150 Super Rugby appearances.\nEarly years.\nBorn in Saudi Arabia to Irish parents, his father Tommy came from Tuam, County Galway and his mother Maureen came from Killasser near Swinford, County Mayo. He and his family moved to Tuam, in the mid-eighties before they emigrated to Mount Morgan, Queensland, Australia in 1988, when he was five years old. His family later moved to Rockhampton, before finally settling in Brisbane.\nCareer.\nMoore came up through the junior ranks in Queensland, playing schools rugby with Rockhampton Pioneers and Brisbane Grammar School prior to joining the University of Queensland Rugby Club from where he represented the Australian Under 19s. He made his Super 12 debut in 2003 for the Queensland Reds against the Bulls. He then went on to play for the under-21 Australian team at the 2003 and 2004 under-21 world championships, as well as with Australia A.\nHe was included in the 2005 Wallabies squad for the mid-year Tests. He debuted with Rocky Elsom against Samoa. He came off the bench in matches against Samoa, Italy and France. He was then capped three times against South Africa. In November he joined the Wallabies in France when fellow hooker Adam Freier sustained an injury. He played in the loss against France on 5 November. After the whirlwind of 2005 where Moore made his debut for the Wallabies and featured in every Queensland Reds Super 12 game, 2006 was a mixed bag which saw him finish the season on the reserves bench. However, his skills and strength as a ball runner brought an extra dimension to the Reds forwards and earned him selection on the Wallabies end of year tour to Europe.\nIn November 2006, Moore travelled to Europe for the Autumn Internationals series. He was used as a replacement in the Australia v Italy game (25–18) in the Stadio Flaminio, Rome. He then played for the Australia A squad that defeated Ireland A mid-week in Thomond Park, Limerick. He then came on as a replacement in the 54th minute of the Ireland vs Australia game, in which Ireland ran out easy winners 21–6, in appalling conditions at Lansdowne Road stadium, Dublin. He made his first full International appearance for Australia the following weekend against Scotland at Murrayfield Stadium in Edinburgh, touching down a pass from Matt Giteau to score his first International try. Australia were easy victors with a scoreline of Australia 44 – Scotland 15.\nIn 2010, Moore appeared in all 13 matches for the Brumbies until breaking his jaw in the final round of regular season.\nSince the 2011 Tri Nations Series, Moore has been named in every squad, usually as first choice hooker. He was a key player in Australia's 2011 winning Tri Nations Series, and 2011 Rugby World Cup campaign, in which Australia finished third. Since Australia's first match against France in the 2012 end-of-year rugby union tests, Moore had played every single match for the Wallabies, including starting every test in 2013 British &amp; Irish Lions tour to Australia. When Robbie Deans resigned following the Lions series and when Ewen McKenzie took over the reins, Moore started at Hooker for the Wallabies for the remainder of the 2013 Test schedule playing very well.\nIn McKenzie's second year in charge, McKenzie named Stephen Moore as captain for the 2014 three-test June series against France, with Michael Hooper and Adam Ashley-Cooper as vice captains. However, in his first Test as Wallabies captain, Moore picked up a season-ending ACL knee injury as he went down awkwardly when making a tackle in the second minute and he left the field in the 5th minutes of the game in the Wallabies' 50–23 win over France at Brisbane's Suncorp Stadium.\nOn 6 July 2015, Moore was named as Wallabies' captain for the upcoming World Cup under new coach Michael Cheika. Moore subsequently lead the Wallabies to the final against New Zealand, with the final score 34–17 to New Zealand, the highest overall combined score in a Rugby World Cup final.\nMoore broke the record for most Super Rugby tries in a single season scored by a hooker in 2016, crossing the line seven times for the Brumbies that season, including a double in the 43–24 win against his former team the Reds. Moore also announced in late 2015 that he would return to the Reds following the 2016 season.\nIn 2017 Moore announced that he would retire from international rugby at the end of the year and retire from Super Rugby at the end of 2018. Moore's captaincy was immediately given to Michael Hooper. He last played for Australia on 25 November 2017, in a record 53–24 defeat to Scotland.\nMoore was made a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours in recognition of his \"significant service to rugby union, and to charitable organisations\".\nPersonal life.\nMoore is married to Courtney, and has three children, Theodore, Darcy, and Lawrence."

        "text": "The Czech Republic competed at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway.\nIt was the first Winter Games since the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, and so the Czech Republic and Slovakia competed as independent teams.\nCross-country skier Pavel Benc was the flag-bearer of the country in the opening ceremony – he thus had a chance to lead the last Winter Olympic Czechoslovak team in Albertville and the first ever Czech team in Lillehammer.\nAlthough the three medals won by Czechoslovakia in Albertville in 1992 were all won by Czech athletes (the ice hockey team had also three Slovaks), the result of Lillehammer Olympics were less satisfying as fifth places of ice hockey and Nordic combined teams were the Czech Republic’s best results. It can be explained with the growth of competition as the former Soviet Union countries entered their athletes (only Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia participated in the 1992 Winter Olympics besides the Unified Team).\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors in the Games.\nBobsleigh.\nJiří Džmura and Pavel Polomský became most successful Czech bobsledders in Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track. They finished fifth in the first run of two-men bobsleigh competition, falling slowly in the results to eventually finish in seventh tied with Canada’s Pierre Lueders. In the four-men competition, the Czech team went through the competition in the opposite manner – starting 14th and moving up step by step to the 10th-place finish with a fifth best fourth run.\nCross-country skiing.\nKateřina Neumannová presented a huge leap in form since last Olympics, finishing only 13 seconds behind podium in 5 km classical and moving up to sixth place in the pursuit. She recorded the second best time on her third leg of women’s relay (losing only to Russia’s Nina Gavrilyuk) and had the leading role in the ninth-place finish of the Czech relay team as other women had 11th to 13th times in their respective legs.\nMen participated with almost the same squad like in Albertville, but their performances were far worse than in French Alps.\nFigure skating.\nRadka Kovaříková and René Novotný were fourth in the 1992 Winter Olympics and in 1994 they recorded their fourth consecutive fourth place in the European Championships. Two great pairs-champions however returned this season and were great favorites, which was confirmed as 1988 Olympic champions Ekaterina Gordeeva and Sergei Grinkov beat 1992 Olympic champions Nataliya Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev. The Czech couple was not able to fight for a medal in such competition. It finished fifth in the short program, but fell down to sixth in a free program behind United States’ Jenni Meno and Todd Sand. The next year Kovaříková and Novotný however won the Figure Skating World Championships and turned professionals.\nKateřina Mrázová and Martin Šimeček recorded their best Olympic finish in ice dancing competition in eighth place in a competition crowned by Jayne Torvill and Christopher Dean comeback to the Olympics, 10 years after their revolutionary Bolero.\nIce hockey.\nCzech Republic arrived to Lillehammer as the unbeaten winner of the recent Globen Cup, the Swedish part of the European Hockey Tour. The Olympic tournament however had a rather different result. Finland, at the start of the tournament not supposed to be a favorite, was in the lead since the fifth minute power play goal, following three games added the compulsory victories but only win over Germany coached by Luděk Bukač was supported by a good play. The team was not able to beat any of the strong European team and lost to Russia 3-4 to leave it in fourth place in group but to finish only third behind Finland, which hammered Russia, and Germany.\nThe standings in the other group set a tie against Canada in the quarterfinals. The Czechs lead twice in the game and Canada scores the tying goal five minutes to the end of regulation. In the overtime, Paul Kariya scored the sudden-death power-play goal (Horák served the penalty). The Czechs had to settle with the 5-8th places classification games and avoided surprise beating United States 5-3 after losing to them 0-2 early in the first period. The 5th to 6th place game was the first confrontation of former compatriots, but Slovakia was overmotivated and outplayed 7-1 (the game was decided in the first period, despite losing 0-1 in third minute, the Czechs won it 5-1).\nCanada eliminated Czech Republic also in the 1994 World Championships; the two 5th-place finishes forced Ivan Hlinka to withdraw. His successor Luděk Bukač then leads Czech Republic to the 1996 World Championships title, first since 1985 and first of four titles in six years.\nNordic combined.\nThe team competition brought a surprising result for the Czech Republic which eventually occurred to be one of the biggest successes of the whole Olympic team. Zbyněk Pánek, Milan Kučera and František Máka all had one good and one worse jump in the ski-jumping competition (Pánek and Kučera were better in the first round, Máka, who was better cross-country skier, bettered his result in the second round). The Czechs started the cross-country relay in sixth place, 10:50 minutes behind sovereign Japanese jumpers.\nThe relay was not a dramatic one, as no change happened from first to fourth place, Zbyněk Pánek moved the Czechs past Austria to fifth place already in the first leg. Milan Kučera held the place despite his worst cross-country performance and František Máka brought the relay home in fifth ahead of fast-finishing France.\nSki jumping.\nTwo-time team Olympic medalist Jiří Parma was below par in Lillehammer and thus only Jaroslav Sakala managed to record a good individual result in Lillehammer, finishing seventh in large hill competition, but he did not improve in the next two competitions. In the team competition Parma was the weakest member of the team as Zbyněk Krompolc surprisingly recorded best results of the whole team."

He was a native of Morrisonville, Illinois and the father of MLB center fielder Del Unser.\nBiography.\nAlthough Unser's major league career was short, he had a lengthy career in minor league baseball. He began his professional career in , playing for three different minor league teams that season. He was picked up by the St. Louis Cardinals organization in , playing in their farm system until . In , he served as manager of the class-D Gastonia Cardinals of the Tar Heel League, guiding them to the league championship.\nIn , Unser joined the Tigers' farm system, spending that season with the Beaumont Exporters of the Texas League. He spent most of the season as a player-manager with the Winston-Salem Twins of the Piedmont League, and at the end of the season he joined the major league club. Unser became one of many baseball players who only appeared in the major leagues during World War II, making his major league debut at age 29 on September 14, 1942, in a home game against the Washington Senators at Briggs Stadium.\nOver the next two seasons, Unser played sparingly for Detroit, spending part of each season in the minors with the Buffalo Bisons. The following season, he joined the Reds, where he had his best season in . In his only full season in the majors, Unser batted .265 in 67 games with 3 home runs and 21 runs batted in (RBI). His career MLB totals for 120 games include a .251 batting average (85-for-338), 4 home runs, 30 RBI, 41 runs, .322 on-base percentage, and a slugging percentage of .355.\nIn , Unser returned to the minor leagues with the Hollywood Stars of the Pacific Coast League, spending two seasons with the club.

In 2011, the team left the Stade Vuillermet to the new Matmut Stadium. In 2017 the team moved to the Matmut Stadium de Gerland.\nHistory.\n\"Le LOU\", as it is traditionally known, is one of the oldest sports clubs in France and among the first outside Paris to have set up a rugby section. The club’s original name was Racing Club, the result of a merger of the Racing Club de Vaise and the Rugby Club de Lyon. It was renamed Racing et Cercles Réunis in 1902 after several other clubs joined it, then a few months later Lyon Olympique. Finally, in 1910, it became Lyon Olympique Universitaire. The red and black were adopted in 1902.\nThe club developed several sections (it now has 13), one of the most successful being the rugby union section, which is now known as \"LOU Rugby\". The rugby club took part in three successive French championship finals (1931–33), losing the first one to Toulon (3-6) but winning the next two against Narbonne (9-3 and 10-3). It then played in lower amateur leagues until it was promoted back to the second professional division (Pro D2).

They play in red and white. They are based in Tarbes, the capital of the Hautes-Pyrénées département, in Occitania, and play at the Stade Maurice Trélut.\nHistory.\nSeveral clubs from the Bigorre region have been part of the history of rugby union in France, but none of them was able to keep up with the times when professionalism appeared. Stadoceste Tarbais, the big regional gun, a two-time French champion, was struggling in the amateur leagues, like FC Lourdes (8 times French champion) and Stade Bagnérais. However, at the end of the 1999-2000 season, CA Lannemezan reached Pro D2 for the first time ever. But the Ligue Nationale de Rugby, which operates the French professional leagues, blocked the promotion, fearing that a club in a town of 6 000-odd inhabitants would never survive as a professional outfit. Stadoceste Tarbais, which had just been promoted to the 4th division (Fédérale 2), made CA Lannemezan an offer to join forces in order to build a strong viable club and reach Top 14 in the near future. Tarbes and Lannemezan are 35 km apart. The plan was backed by the local government of Hautes-Pyrénées, which would only support one top level club in the area. FC Lourdes and Stade Bagnérais were offered to join but rejected the offer as they feared that they would lose their identity in a bigger club which, in all likelihood, would play in the capital of the department, Tarbes. The board of CA Lannemezan originally rejected the merger 73%–27%, but the club president managed to get it done.\nIn August 2000, the new club LT65 (Lannemezan Tarbes Hautes-Pyrénées) took off as a merger of Stadoceste Tarbais and CA Lannemezan, and took the place of Lannemezan in Pro D2. Very soon though, dissensions appeared inside the club: all games were played in Tarbes, while Lannemezan became « dead on matchdays » (according to the CAL president), professional and semi-professional players were mixed, leading to frictions inside the squad etc. Soon, the club was renamed Tarbes Pyrénées Rugby, severing the symbolic link with Lannemezan. In 2003, some players and board members left and decided to relaunch the senior team in their lifelong club which had kept its youth teams. By 2005, Lannemezan was back in Fédérale 1 and hoping to climb back to Pro D2, with a view to juicy derbies against TPR; their ambitions were realized in 2009, when they won the Fédérale 1 crown and earned promotion to Pro D2.

Raymond van Barneveld dominated the tournament, held in his home country, winning it on three of the five occasions it was held. Gary Anderson was the final champion, having claimed the title in 2007, when the tournament also became the first major event to witness two nine dart finishes.\nHeld in May, it was the second leg of the BDO’s Grand Slam title of televised majors, along with the World Darts Trophy, the Winmau World Masters and the Lakeside World Professional Championship.\nIt began as a tournament for BDO players, but following van Barneveld's move to the PDC, Dutch broadcaster SBS-6 were able to grant five invitations to non-WDF affiliated players for the first time in 2006, in order to maintain interest in the event. The number of invitations was increased to 20 in 2007 as more Dutch players, including Jelle Klaasen and Michael van Gerwen, had moved to the PDC. This was done with the agreement of the Schoofs Management &amp; Events/Maximum Score – the owner and promoter of the tournament.\nEnd of event.\nTowards the end of 2007, the chairman of the PDC, Barry Hearn, announced that its players would not be competing in the 2008 International Darts League and World Darts Trophy events. As a result, SBS6 announced they would no longer be broadcasting the event, with their coverage relying heavily on big names such as van Barneveld, which then cast doubts over whether either tournament would go ahead.\nThe tournament promoters filed a lawsuit against the PDC and SBS6 claiming a contract had been agreed for the PDC players to be involved. The case ended in failure on 21 February 2008, and the International Darts League was indefinitely postponed. The future of the World Darts Trophy was also thrown into doubt as a result of the decision, and both events were confirmed defunct by the failure of an appeal on April 29, 2008.\nFormat.\nThe format has changed slightly over the years – the 2006 competition had 8 round-robin groups of 4 players. The top two players in each group qualified for another round-robin phase. Again, the top two players in each group progressed, but this time to the quarter-finals of the knockout stages.\nDespite the presence of the PDC players in 2006 and 2007, the tournament was still a WDF/BDO ranking event, with all available points going only to the WDF/BDO players competing.\nInternational Darts League finals.\n! rowspan=2 | Year\n! rowspan=2 | Champion \n! rowspan=2 | Score\n! rowspan=2 | Runner-up \n! colspan=3 | Prize money\n! rowspan=2 | Sponsor\n! rowspan=2 | Venue\n!

        "text": "Sailing stones (also called sliding rocks, walking rocks, rolling stones, and moving rocks) are part of the geological phenomenon in which rocks move and inscribe long tracks along a smooth valley floor without animal intervention. The movement of the rocks occurs when large, thin sheets of ice floating on an ephemeral winter pond break up in the sun. Trails of sliding rocks have been observed and studied in various locations, including Little Bonnie Claire Playa, in Nevada, and most famously at Racetrack Playa, Death Valley National Park, California, where the number and length of tracks are notable.\nDescription.\nThe Racetrack's stones speckle the playa floor, predominantly in the southern portion. Historical accounts identify some stones around from shore, yet most of the stones are found relatively close to their respective originating outcrops. Three lithologic types are identified:\nThis dolomite composes nearly all stones found in the southern half of the playa, and originates at a steep promontory, high, paralleling the east shore at the south end of the playa. Intrusive igneous rock originates from adjacent slopes (most of those being tan-colored feldspar-rich syenite). Tracks are often up to long, about wide, and typically much less than deep. Most moving stones range from about in diameter.\nStones with rough bottoms leave straight striated tracks, while those with smooth bottoms tend to wander. Stones sometimes turn over, exposing another edge to the ground and leaving a different track in the stone's wake.\nTrails differ in both direction and length. Rocks that start next to each other may travel parallel for a time, before one abruptly changes direction to the left, right, or even back to the direction from which it came. Trail length also varies – two similarly sized and shaped rocks may travel uniformly, then one could move ahead or stop in its track.\nA balance of specific conditions is thought to be needed for stones to move:\nResearch history.\nAt Racetrack Playa, these tracks have been studied since the early 1900s, yet the origins of stone movement were not confirmed and remained the subject of research for which several hypotheses existed. However, as of August 2014, timelapse video footage of rocks moving has been published, showing the rocks moving at high wind speeds within the flow of thin, melting sheets of ice. The scientists have thus identified the cause of the moving stones to be ice shove.\nEarly investigation.\nThe first documented account of the sliding rock phenomenon dates to 1915, when a prospector named Joseph Crook from Fallon, Nevada, visited the Racetrack Playa site. In the following years, the Racetrack sparked interest from geologists Jim McAllister and Allen Agnew, who mapped the bedrock of the area in 1948 and published the earliest report about the sliding rocks in a Geologic Society of America Bulletin. Their publication gave a brief description of the playa furrows and scrapers, stating that no exact measurements had been taken and suggesting that furrows were the remnants of scrapers propelled by strong gusts of wind – such as the variable winds that produce dust-devils – over a muddy playa floor. Controversy over the origin of the furrows prompted the search for the occurrence of similar phenomena at other locations. Such a location was found at Little Bonnie Claire Playa in Nye County, Nevada, and the phenomenon was studied there, as well.\nNaturalists from the National Park Service later wrote more detailed descriptions and \"Life\" magazine featured a set of photographs from the Racetrack. In 1952, a National Park Service Ranger named Louis G. Kirk recorded detailed observations of furrow length, width, and general course. He sought simply to investigate and record evidence of the moving rock phenomenon, not to hypothesize or create an extensive scientific report. Speculation about how the stones move started at this time. Various and sometimes idiosyncratic possible explanations have been put forward over the years that have ranged from the supernatural to the complex. Most hypotheses favored by interested geologists posit that strong winds when the mud is wet are at least in part responsible. Some stones weigh as much as a human, which some researchers, such as geologist George M. Stanley, who published a paper on the topic in 1955, feel is too heavy for the area's winds to move. After extensive track mapping and research on rotation of the tracks in relation to ice floe rotation, Stanley maintained that ice sheets around the stones either help to catch the wind or that ice floes initiate rock movement.\nProgress in the 1970s.\nBob Sharp and Dwight Carey started a Racetrack stone movement monitoring program in May 1968. Eventually, 30 stones with fresh tracks were labeled and stakes were used to mark their locations. Each stone was given a name and changes in the stones' positions were recorded over a seven-year period. Sharp and Carey also tested the ice floe hypothesis by corralling selected stones. A corral in diameter was made around a wide, track-making stone with seven rebar segments placed apart. If a sheet of ice around the stones either increased wind-catching surface area or helped move the stones by dragging them along in ice floes, then the rebar should at least slow down and deflect the movement. Neither appeared to occur; the stone barely missed a rebar as it moved to the northwest out of the corral in the first winter. Two heavier stones were placed in the corral at the same time; one moved five years later in the same direction as the first, but its companion did not move during the study period. This indicated that if ice played a part in stone movement, then ice collars around stones must be small.\nTen of the initial 30 stones moved in the first winter with Mary Ann (stone A) covering the longest distance at . Two of the next six monitored winters also had multiple stones move. No stones were confirmed to have moved in the summer, and in some winters, none or only a few stones moved. In the end, all but two of the monitored stones moved during the seven-year study. At in diameter, Nancy (stone H) was the smallest monitored stone. It also moved the longest cumulative distance, , and the greatest single winter movement, . The largest stone to move was .\nKaren (stone J) is a block of dolomite and weighs an estimated . Karen did not move during the monitoring period. The stone may have created its long, straight and old track from momentum gained from its initial fall onto the wet playa. However, Karen disappeared sometime before May 1994, possibly during the unusually wet winter of 1992 to 1993. Removal by artificial means is considered unlikely due to the lack of associated damage to the playa that a truck and winch would have caused. A possible sighting of Karen was made in 1994, from the playa. Karen was rediscovered by San Jose geologist Paula Messina in 1996.\nContinued research in the 1990s.\nProfessor John Reid led six research students from Hampshire College and the University of Massachusetts Amherst in a follow-up study in 1995. They found highly congruent trails from stones that moved in the late 1980s and during the winter of 1992–93. At least some stones were proved beyond a reasonable doubt to have been moved in ice floes that may be up to wide. Physical evidence included swaths of lineated areas that could only have been created by moving thin sheets of ice. Consequently, both wind alone and wind in conjunction with ice floes are thought to be motive forces.\nPhysicists Bacon \"et al.\" studying the phenomenon in 1996, informed by studies in Owens Dry Lake Playa, discovered that winds blowing on playa surfaces can be compressed and intensified because of a playa's smooth, flat surfaces. They also found that boundary layers (the region just above ground where winds are slower due to ground drag) on these surfaces can be as low as . As a result, stones just a few centimeters high feel the full force of ambient winds and their gusts, which can reach in winter storms. Such gusts are thought to be the initiating force, while momentum and sustained winds keep the stones moving, possibly as fast as a moderate run.\nWind and ice both are the favored hypothesis for these sliding rocks. Noted in \"Surface Processes and Landforms\", Don J. Easterbrook mentions that because of the lack of parallel paths between some rock paths, this could be caused by degenerating ice floes resulting in alternate routes. Though the ice breaks up into smaller blocks, it is still necessary for the rocks to slide.\n21st-century developments.\nFurther understanding of the geologic processes at work in Racetrack Playa goes hand in hand with technological development. In 2009, development of inexpensive time-lapse digital cameras allowed the capturing of transient meteorological phenomena including dust devils and playa flooding. These cameras were aimed at capturing various stages of the previously mentioned phenomena, though discussion of the sliding stones ensued. The developers of photographic technology describe the difficulty of capturing the Racetrack's stealthy rocks, as movements only occur about once every three years, and they believed, lasted about 10 seconds. Their next identified advancement was wind-triggered imagery, vastly reducing the ten million seconds of nontransit time they had to sift through.\nIt was postulated that small rafts of ice form around the rocks and the rocks are buoyantly floated off the soft bed, thus reducing the reaction and friction forces at the bed. Since this effect depends on reducing friction, and not on increasing the wind drag, these ice cakes need not have a particularly large surface area if the ice is adequately thick, as the minimal friction allows the rocks to be moved by arbitrarily light winds.\nReinforcing the \"ice raft\" theory, a research study pointed out narrowing trails, intermittent springs, and trail ends having no rocks. The study identified that water drained from higher area into the Playa while ice covered the intermittent lake. This suggests that this water buoyantly lifts the ice floes with embedded rocks until friction with the playa bed is reduced sufficiently for wind to move them and cause the observed tracks. The study also analyses an artificial ditch intended to prevent visitors from driving on the playa, and concludes that it may interfere with rock sliding.\nIn 2020, NASA ruled out the potential reasons for the stones moving results from the microbial mats and wind-generated water waves based on a fossil of dinosaur footprints.\nExplanation.\nNews articles reported the mystery solved when researchers observed rock movements using GPS and time-lapse photography. The largest rock movement the research team witnessed and documented was on December 20, 2013 and involved more than 60 rocks, with some rocks moving up to 224 metres (245 yards) between December 2013 and January 2014 in multiple movement events. These observations contradicted earlier hypotheses of strong winds or thick ice floating rocks off the surface. Instead, rocks move when large ice sheets a few millimeters thick floating in an ephemeral winter pond start to break up during sunny mornings. These thin floating ice panels, frozen during cold winter nights, are driven by light winds and shove rocks at up to 5 m/min (0.3 km/h; 0.2 mph). Some GPS-measured moves lasted up to 16 minutes, and a number of stones moved more than five times during the existence of the playa pond in the winter of 2013–14.\nPossible influence of climate change.\nBecause rock movement relies on a rare set of circumstances, the usually dry playa being flooded and the water freezing, drier winters and warmer winter nights would cause such circumstances to occur less often. A statistical study by Ralph Lorenz and Brian Jackson examining published reports of rock movements suggested (with 4:1 odds) an apparent decline between the 1960s–1990s, and the 21st century.\nTheft and vandalism of rocks.\nOn May 30, 2013, the \"Los Angeles Times\" reported that park officials were looking into the theft of several of the rocks from the Death Valley National Park.\nIn August 2016, around of tire tracks were left in the playa by someone driving around it illegally. A photographer visiting in September also noted the initials 'D' and 'K' newly carved into one of the rocks. Although reports at the time suggested investigators had identified a suspect, the vandal had not been identified in March 2018, when a team of volunteers cleaned the tire tracks from the Racetrack using gardening tools and of water."

The Panama Cricket Association became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002 and is an associate member since 2017. Their international debut is believed to have taken place against a side from Trinidad and Tobago in 1964.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Panama and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be eligible to have full T20I status.\nHistory.\nCricket was introduced to Panama by colonials from the West Indies during the creation of the Panama Canal. After the colonials left the country, most of the nation's attention was turned to cricket. The growing number of inhabitants of Indian origin created a group called the Indian Society.\nThe purpose of this society was to create opportunities for relationships and to find new venues in which cricket could be played. Due to this effort, the popularity of the game grew. \nPanama joined the ICC as an Affiliate Member in 2002 and since then, cricket has been flourishing among the younger population of the country.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Panama and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nIn September 2018,Panama took part in 2018–19 ICC T20 World Cup Americas Qualifier, finished on 3rd place in Northern Sub Region.\nPanama played their first ever Twenty20 International match against Costa Rica in 2019 Central American Cricket Championship.\nInternational competition.\nThe team's first international matches in recent years came in a friendly series played against Venezuela in 2000, which Panama won 1–0. Panama was invited to play in the fourth South American Cricket Championships later that year. The team performed well in its first international tournament, finishing fourth of the seven teams.\nPanama has been playing without the services of a national coach. Playing in recent regional ICC tournaments, Panama has finished second and third, ahead of countries such as Belize, Brazil, and Turks and Caicos. The most recent participation came in the 2010 Americas Division Two, held in the Bahamas, where the team won three matches out of four and only missed out on promotion on net run-rate.\nDevelopment programme.\nThe chief concern is the loss of cricket grounds. During recent years, four grounds have been lost to soccer due to financial difficulties. The Panama Cricket Association is therefore looking to a secure a ground for its national players.\nPlans are being made to start coaching for junior players but once again this is limited by finances as use of a gym is required, due to a rainy season that lasts for eight months of the year.\nProgress in Tournaments since 2002.\nIn 2002, Panama was granted affiliate status by the ICC along with a number of other countries in the Americas Region. Two years later, they hosted their first international tournament, the Americas Affiliate Championships. They finished as runners up to the Bahamas, just missing out on qualification for the ICC Americas Championship.\nThe affiliates tournament was expanded to a multi-division competition in 2006, and Panama was placed in Division Two. They finished third in that tournament, which was played in Argentina, behind the hosts and the Bahamas. They retained their place in Division Two for 2008. In this part of the competition, played in Suriname, Panama finished in third place and remained in the division for the next cycle, in 2010. In the same year, Panama also finished in 3rd place behind Suriname and the hosts, the Bahamas. In the 2011 Championship, Panama stayed as runners-up behind Suriname in Division 2.\nPanama entered and hosted the Central American Championships for the first time in 2009. They came in as favorites, being the strongest Central American international side, and won the competition.

        "title": "Portugal national cricket team",
        "text": "The Portuguese national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Portugal in international cricket.\nHistory.\nBeginnings.\nCricket in Portugal dates back to the Peninsular War of 1809–1814, when English troops were encamped in Lisbon. A game between sides from Porto and Lisbon has been played almost every year since 1861. English club teams paid frequent visits; the Cryptics Cricket Club toured eight times between 1924 and 1939. The game was confined, however, to the expatriate community, particularly the port wine manufacturers of Porto, until events in 1974 gave Portuguese cricket an unexpected boost.\nPlaying numbers increase.\nThe Carnation Revolution led to many Portuguese citizens returning from their former overseas province of Goa, and the subsequent independence of Mozambique brought many Portuguese citizens back, bringing cricket with them. Other Portuguese citizens living in Portugal's former African overseas provinces moved to Rhodesia and South Africa, where their children were absorbed into the sporting cultures of those countries, and the subsequent socio-political changes there led to them bringing their love of cricket back to Portugal.\nInternational competition.\nThe Cricket Association of Portugal was founded in 1994 and they became an ICC member two years later. Their first international engagement was in the European Nations Cup in Switzerland in 1997, where they reached the semi-finals. They competed in that tournament's successor, the ECC Trophy in 1999, finishing as runners up and qualifying for Division Two of the European Championship in 2000. They finished fourth in that tournament.\nThey again played in the ECC Trophy in 2001, this time winning the tournament, again qualifying for Division Two of the European Championship in 2002. They finished third and then played in the ECC Trophy in 2003. This time their performances from the previous two tournaments did not continue and they finished in 5th place, a performance they repeated in the European Affiliates Championship in 2005. They will compete in Division Three of the European Championships in 2007.\n1st tournament ( The European Nations Cup 1997 ).\nIn 1997 Portugal played their first tournament. It was the European Nations Cup 1997. They also played their first match in that tournament. Their first match was against Greece at Lyceum Alpinum, Zuoz, Switzerland 19 August 1997. In that match Portugal made a 381/3 batting first and their players TG Rankine and Intesab Mehdi has scored two fine innings of 173 and 81*. After Portugal's innings Greece came down to bat. But for the bashing bowling of Portugal's bowlers Greece was all out at 115 in 29 overs. Santilal made the best bowling figure (3/27 in 6 overs) in Portugal's innings. Portugal won that match by 266 runs.\nIn their second match on 20 August 1997 against Malta at the same stadium Portugal batted first. They scored 297/9. Opener Nadeem Butt scored a wonderful 96 run innings. Again the bowlers of Portugal bowled well. Daia had made a figure of 10–2–35–3. Malta was all out in 187 in 41 overs. Portugal won that match by 110 runs.\nIn their last match on 21 August 1997 against Austria at the same stadium Portugal batted First like the two other matches. But this match Portugal could make a 240/7. Nazir Usman made the highest run of 45, while lower order batsman Daia and G Ramchande made a 39 and 27. They made 72 runs partnership in the 7th wicket. Austria did well. But they couldn't reached to the destination of 241 in 50 overs. But they made a 214 in 46.1 overs. 1st down Batsman A Simpson-Parker made the highest score of Austria's innings. He scored 55. G Ramchande made 3/41 in 9.1 overs. Portugal won that match by 26 runs.\nPortugal was top of the group B with 6 points in 3 matches.\nIn the semi-final, Portugal, champion of Group B, met France, the runners up of Group A. But unfortunately Portugal lost that match against France. \nPortugal batted first for a fourth consecutive time. But in the semi-final Portugal's batting line-up was outmatched against the France's bowling. Portugal managed a 156 all out in 40.4 overs. Nadeem Butt scored 33 runs which was the highest runs of Portugal's innings. France made 157 very easily in 45.3 overs with 7 wickets in hand. Number 3 batsman N Jones made a 60.\nBecause of the unexpected defeat against France, Portugal was knocked out from the semi-final of The European Nations Cup 1997.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Portugal and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. \nPortugal played their first T20I on 25 October 2019, against Spain, during the 2019 Iberia Cup.\nDomestic cricket.\nThe only league in Portuguese cricket for the last decade has been the Lisbon League, which has been played by a varying number of local clubs (between three and seven) depending on the economic activity in the area. Most recently, the National League has been contested by Lisbon-based teams and two new clubs – one from the Algarve and one from Almoster. There are four registered clubs – Asian CC, Oeiras CC, Comunidade Hindu Portuguesa CC (CHP), and Friends CC in the Lisbon area, with a club in Oporto (Oporto Cricket and Lawn Tennis Club), a club in the Algarve (Barrington's CC) and one from Almoster (Presban CC).

The team is organised by the Qatar Cricket Association, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1999 and an associate member in 2017.\nQatar made its international debut in 1979, at an invitational tournament that also included Bahrain, Kuwait, and Sharjah (one of the United Arab Emirates). The team's first Asian Cricket Council (ACC) event was the 2002 ACC Trophy in Singapore. For a period during the 2000s, Qatar was one of the top-ranked non-Test teams in Asia – at the 2004 ACC Trophy, the team placed fourth. However, a few years later it was relegated to the second-division ACC events.\nQatar made its first and only World Cricket League (WCL) appearance at the 2017 ICC World Cricket League Division Five event in South Africa. It placed third, enough to secure the team a place in the new 2019–21 ICC Cricket World Cup Challenge League.\nHistory.\nInternational competition.\nQatar's international debut came in 2002 at the ACC Trophy, where they failed to progress beyond the first round. A major improvement came in the next tournament in 2004 when they came fourth. This qualified them for the final pre-qualifying tournament for the 2005 ICC Trophy, played in Malaysia in early 2005. They finished fourth in that tournament, thereby dropping off the road to qualification to the 2007 World Cup. They once again competed at the ACC Trophy in 2006, this time finishing in eighth place. They will play in the new Champions division of that tournament in 2008.\n2018–present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Qatar and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I.\nQatar made its Twenty20 International debut on 21 January 2019, defeating Saudi Arabia by 4 wickets in the 2019 ACC Western Region T20 at Al Emarat Cricket Stadium, Muscat, Oman.\nYouth cricket.\nQatar have fielded sides in regional competition at Under 15, Under 17 and Under 19 levels.\nUnder 15s.\nThe Qatar Under 15 team competed in Asia Cup tournaments in 2002, 2005 and 2006. They failed to progress beyond the first round on all occasions. Even after losing just one game (against Oman) in the group stage of the 2006 competition, they were not allowed to play in the semi-finals as they did not abide by the qualification rules.\nUnder 17s.\nThe Qatar Under 17 team competed in the Asia Cup for the first time in 2004, where they did not progress past the first round. In 2005, they reached the quarter-finals.\nUnder 19s.\nThe Under 19 team has participated in Asia Cup tournaments in 2001, 2003 and 2005, reaching the semi-finals on the 2003 &amp; 2005 editions. In the 2001 they came runner up in the plate league.

Saudi Arabia made its international debut at the 2004 ACC Trophy in Malaysia, and has since played regularly in Asian Cricket Council (ACC) tournaments. After finishing second in the 2014 ACC Elite League, the team qualified for the World Cricket League for the first time. Saudi Arabia was due to compete in the 2015 Division Six event, but members of the team were denied visas by the host country, forcing the team to withdraw.\nHistory.\nThe international debut of the Saudi senior team came in the ACC Trophy in 2004, where they failed to progress beyond the first round. They again failed to go past the first round in 2006, but had the remarkable achievement of scoring 499 runs in 50 overs against Brunei. Earlier in the year they came fourth in the Middle East Cup.\nArguably their greatest moment in international cricket to date came in the 2008 ACC Trophy Elite when they defeated the UAE by 29 runs, a team which has had previous One Day International experience.\nWith the separation of the ACC Trophy into Elite and Challenge divisions, following their performance at the 2006 ACC Trophy Saudi Arabia they competed in the Elite division in the 2008 competition, in which they came 10th. This result relegated them to the 2009 ACC Trophy Challenge, in which they did not appear. They did, however, appear in the 2010 competition, in which they came 2nd and gained promotion back to the Elite division.\nBesides the 50 over format, Saudi Arabia have also played in the Twenty20 format of the game in the 2007 ACC Twenty20 Cup, in which they failed to progress beyond the group stage, and the 2009 ACC Twenty20 Cup, in which they came 8th.\n2018-present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members.

In 1967 the West African Championships were created with former British colonies Nigeria and Ghana also sending teams.

        "title": "FC Porto (basketball)",
        "text": "Futebol Clube do Porto (), commonly referred to as FC Porto, or simply Porto, is a Portuguese professional basketball team based in Porto. Created in 1926, it is the senior representative side of the basketball section of multi-sports club FC Porto. The team competes domestically in the Liga Portuguesa de Basquetebol (LPB) and internationally in FIBA Europe competitions, such as the Champions League and the FIBA Europe Cup.\nThe team plays its home matches at the Dragão Arena, alongside the club's handball and roller hockey teams, and is managed by Portuguese head coach and former club player Fernando Sá since 2022.\nHistory.\nFoundation.\nThe introduction of the sport in Portugal took place in 1913, and thirteen years later in 1926 a group of partners of the club decided to create a basketball team. António Sanches, António Marta and Daniel Barbosa drove the idea, having them joined by Gabriel Batista and A. Cabral to complete the team. The second place in the \"Cup António Cardoso\" guaranteed in the first season excites the community that forms immediately four other basketball teams. FC Porto basketball players trained in an outdoor field complex included in Campo da Constituição.\nEarly years.\nThe decades of the thirties and forties were not very fertile in securities for the basketball section of FC Porto, but still the sport was up solidifying a club that showed increasingly eclectic. In the year 1933, the first Campeonato de Portugal was played, and Porto participated alongside Conimbricense, Académico, Fluvial, Guifões, Sp. Braga, Atlético de Braga and Sporting de Gouveia. In 1940, FC Porto have played in a covered, lighted, on Avenida dos Aliados enclosure. The fruit came in late because in 1947–48 and 1949–50 FC Porto was national champion of the second division and two seasons later was national champion in the First Division in 1951–52 and 1952–53.\nThe 1990s achievements.\nThe year 1995 marks a crucial turning point in Portuguese basketball. It is in this year that the League Basketball Club, founded six years earlier, organized the first professional league. The FC Porto basketball section is associated with a sponsor at the time the UBP (going to be appointed FC Porto UBP), and enters with his right foot in the era of professional basketball, winning the first two editions of the league. Around the same time, the team moved to the Pavilhão Rosa Mota, which would provide better working conditions. In 1997 it is created the \"FC Porto, Basquetbol, SAD\", alongside \"FC Porto Futebol, SAD\". The president Jorge Nuno Pinto da Costa accumulated the presidency of both SADs and the club, while Fernando Gomes became the primary administrator.\nAlthough nationally FC Porto is among the best title contenders in all competitions, their performance at the international level is modest, reflecting the position of the Portuguese Basketball against the other European and world federations. Their best European performance succeeded in 1997 and 2000, years that reached the quarter-finals of the FIBA Saporta Cup (in 1997 still called FIBA EuroCup). In between, in 1999, Paulo Pinto, then Porto player, was elected by FIBA as one of the 50 best players in Europe and, as such, included in the list of candidates to join the western selection EURO ALL STAR.\nRecent years.\nAt the end of the 2011–12 season the responsible section informed the coaching staff, which was represented by head coach Moncho López, assistant coach Diogo Gomes, and players (captain Nuno Marçal, André Bessa and David Gomes attended) that the senior team would not compete in the major league championship after losing to Benfica at the Dragão Arena. A new project for the section which fielded players from the section's youth ranks was initiated, they started training under the designation Dragon Force who competed in the national championship CNB third division in season 2012/2013, participating in the final competition. The team secured promotion to the second-tier Proliga in 2013–14, winning that season's title in a playoff final against Illiabum.\nHaving earned the right to compete in the LPB, the club decided to remain in the Proliga for the 2014–15 season. The team defended their Proliga title without losing any match, and were promoted to the 2015–16 LPB. Competing again under the name of FC Porto, the team qualified for the championship playoffs and reached the final, where they beat the four-time defending champions Benfica to secure the club's 12th title.\nHonours.\nDomestic competitions.\nDragon Force"

        "text": "União Desportiva Oliveirense, commonly known as Oliveirense Basquetebol or simply Oliveirense, is a basketball team based in Oliveira de Azemeis, Portugal. It plays in Portuguese LPB. The team has won one Portuguese Cup, one Portuguese Supercup and the League Cup twice. The team is a part of the parent football club U.D. Oliveirense.\nThe last time the club competed in Europe was in the 2003–04 season, when it played in the FIBA Europe League.\nHistory.\nSince its beginning, Oliveirense Basquetebol was a powerhouse in the Portuguese basketball field. In its year of creation, due to the disbanding of the ARCA (Associação Recreativa e Cultural de Azeméis), Oliveirense won the 3rd Division Title, rising to a more competitive 2nd Division.\nHowever, the 2nd Division crumbled to the power of the Oliveirense players, who claimed their second National Title in two years. The rugged battle between the Oliveirense Basquetebol and the main powerhouses of Portuguese basketball was now underway, as the team faced big names, such as S.L. Benfica and FC Porto.\nOnce again, surprises were installed. With a brand new team and a new coach, Oliveirense did not do so well in its first season in the Portuguese LCB, however they were able to maintain their position and would later become, probably, the most powerful squad in Portuguese basketball history.\nYears later, with the signing of Henrique Vieira as a coach, the 3-point expert Brian Crabtree as player, Oliveirense was the most dominant team in Portuguese basketball. During their Golden Years, Oliveirense won many of their palmares. They are, probably, the only team to have won all the National Titles except the Portuguese Championship. Their heated rivalry with Portugal Telecom, who made a three-peat always beating Oliveirense, had names such as Luís Magalhães and the center Jean-Jacques, which there were claims that referees where too scared to call a foul on Jean-Jacques, due to him being a physical specimen.\nFinally, Oliveirense was able to defeat Portugal Telecom for the Portuguese Basketball SuperCup. Oliveirense represented the Portugueses Basketball National Cup, which they won the season before and Portugal Telecom, of course, represented the LCB Champion.\nWith three years in the Championship Finals, they were defeated all three times by the squad of Portugal Telecom. At the end of the last season championship win, Portugal Telecom disbanded through the will of the main shareholder, Portugal Telecom Comunicações.\nWith a, now, clear path to the championship, Oliveirense would once again fail to grab the Portuguese Championship, being eliminated in the second round of the playoffs. This was taken by fans as an enormous disappointment as the Oliveirense squad had the biggest names in the Portuguese LCB, such as veteran Carlos Seixas, former NBA player Trevor Huffman, former Portugal Telecom player Doug Muse and rising stars Carlos Abreu and Gregory Stempin.\nOliveirense would win a heated game against Ovarense Aerosoles for their last title as a professional team. They won the League Cup 83-77 against Ovarense Aerosoles and at the end of the amazing season, disaster struck the Basketball section.\nDue to the financial distress of União Desportiva Oliveirense, Eduardo Costa, president of the club, disbanded the basketball section, the main profit winner of the franchise. Due to public disagreement and pressure by the most important basketball fans in Oliveirense, the youth teams were maintained.\nNot being heard of one season, Oliveirense Basquetebol returned to the CNB2, the lowest division of Portuguese basketball. With former players form the youth teams, Oliveirense reached the 9th position in their first season and the 7th in their second season. They finally won the CNB2 title and promotion to the CNB1 in 2010. The feat was repeated the following year and in 2013 they finally won the Proliga and returned to the first division.\nOn 15 June 2018, Oliveirense conquered their first league title ever after defeating Porto by 3–0 in the finals, thus completing a perfect performance in the playoffs with nine wins in nine matches.\nOn 17 June 2019, Oliveirense won their second league title after defeating Benfica by 3-1 in the finals."

It was titled Star Rank Boxing in the US (following the Gamestar naming convention: \"Star League Baseball\", \"Starbowl Football\").\nGameplay.\n1 player.\nThe player controls a boxer as he boxes his way to the top, earning purse money along the way, progressing up the world rankings until he fights Barry McGuigan himself. Players can create a boxer and customize his style, race, hair and shorts. The player could also choose his next opponent, either at the same ranking, below or above, each with their own lead up time to the fight. The longer the player had until the fight the more time could be spent in the gym, allocating training weeks to the following activities: Weights, sparring, road work, heavy bag or light bag.\nEach of these activities had a benefit on the boxer's stamina, strength and endurance. Roadwork, for example, helped with endurance, whilst weights and heavy bag helped with strength.\nBefore deciding which opponent to fight, a summary is shown of each detailing his attributes. The player can then decide whether take the opponent on. Picking an opponent who is above the player's boxer in the rankings will progress him quicker up the rankings and earn him more money. However, this is risky as higher-ranked fighters are stronger. Some opponents can be beaten quite quickly, whilst others require several rounds of boxing to defeat.\nWhilst boxing the following moves can be employed: Cross, block, body punch, jab, hook and uppercut. At the end of each round a summary is given of points scored and the feeling of the audience as to their excitement levels.\n2 player.\nEach player can choose a boxer from the 20 available, and take part in a 12-round match.\nReception.\nRick Teverbaugh reviewed the game for \"Computer Gaming World\", and stated that \"My belief in sports games is that if they feel like the sport, they must be pretty good. But if they get personally involved in the game as well, they must be great. Star Rank does both and I have no qualms about calling this a great game.\"\nThe game was very well received. \"Crash\" praised the options, graphical detail and animation. \"Sinclair User\" claimed it was \"the best boxing game on the market, for realism it knocks the others for six. It's more complex than \"Frank Bruno\"'s or \"Rocco\"\", while \"Your Sinclair\" summarised it as \"a top-ten contender in the software boxing championships\". Computer Gamer said it was realistic, gripping and long-lasting. The game went to number 2 in the UK sales charts, behind \"M.O.V.I.E.\"."

        "text": "The Bullit World Darts Trophy was a professional darts tournament run by the British Darts Organisation and the World Darts Federation. Held each September from 2002 to 2007, it took place at the in Utrecht, Netherlands. The tournament had a playing format comparable with the two World Championships (BDO and PDC). Until 2007, it formed the third leg of the BDO Grand Slam, along with the BDO World Championship, the World Masters and the International Darts League.\nTournament history.\nFirst held in 2002, the tournament was played under the auspices of the World Darts Federation, British Darts Organisation and the Dutch Darts Association (, the Dutch governing body of darts) and featured players from those organisations up to and including 2005.\nPDC Participation.\nHowever, in 2006, following Raymond van Barneveld's move to the PDC in February of that year, host broadcasters SBS 6, were able to grant invitations to five non-WDF affiliated players, meaning that players from the PDC would be able to compete in the event for the first time. Van Barneveld, along with Phil Taylor, Colin Lloyd, Ronnie Baxter and Peter Manley were given the five invitations that were offered to the PDC.\nIn 2007, the WDT included the top 12 players in the PDC Order of Merit and four PDC Qualifiers, giving a total of 16 PDC players who would line up alongside 12 from the WDF rankings and 4 wildcards, which were given to Jelle Klaasen, Michael van Gerwen, Vincent van der Voort and Mervyn King, all of whom had left the BDO to join the PDC earlier that year.\nEnd of event.\nTowards the end of 2007, the chairman of the PDC, Barry Hearn, announced that its players would not be competing in the 2008 International Darts League and World Darts Trophy events. As a result, SBS6 announced they would no longer be broadcasting the event, with their coverage relying heavily on big names such as van Barneveld, which then cast doubts over whether either tournament would go ahead.\nThe tournament promoters filed a lawsuit against the PDC and SBS6 claiming a contract had been agreed for the PDC players to be involved. The case ended in failure on 21 February 2008, and the International Darts League was indefinitely postponed. The future of the World Darts Trophy was also thrown into doubt as a result of the decision, and both events were confirmed defunct by the failure of an appeal on 29 April 2008."

The Association operates the Japan national cricket team and the Japan women's national cricket team, and organises domestic cricket in Japan. It has been an Associate Member of the International Cricket Council since 2005, belonging to the East-Asia Pacific region, under the International Cricket Council's development program and in 2024, rejoined as a member of the Asian Cricket Council. The headquarters of the Association are in Minato-ku, Tokyo. \nHistory.\nCricket was introduced to Japan in the 1860s, by the British, but did not become organised until the 1980s, when the Japan Cricket Association was formed. They became an affiliate member of the ICC in 1989, and the national team first played in the 1996 ACC Trophy, losing all their games including a 380-run defeat to Fiji. They continued without success in the 1998 tournament and the 2000 tournament.\nAfter the 2000 ACC Trophy, they left the Asian Cricket Council and became part of the ICC's East Asia-Pacific region. They played in the East Asia-Pacific Eights tournament in Australia in February 2002, finishing as runners-up to an Australian indigenous team. Indonesia and South Korea were the other teams in the tournament. In 2004, they hosted the East Asia Pacific Cricket Challenge tournament as part of qualification for the 2007 World Cup, finishing third after beating Indonesia in a play-off.\nIn June 2005, Japan were promoted to associate membership of the ICC and that year they played in the 2005 ICC EAP Cricket Cup in Vanuatu, winning the tournament after beating the Cook Islands in the final. The following year they played in the 2006 ICC EAP Cricket Trophy in Brisbane finishing last in the three team tournament that also involved Fiji and the Cook Islands.\nIn December 2007, Japan took part in the 2007 ICC EAP Cricket Trophy in Auckland, New Zealand, playing against the Cook Islands, Indonesia, Samoa, Tonga and Vanuatu. Japan won the tournament and qualified for Division Five of the World Cricket League where they finished in tenth place out of the twelve countries represented in Jersey.\nOn 22 March 2016, it was announced that Sano, Tochigi, would be home to the Sano International Cricket Ground, which will become Japan's first dedicated cricketing venue built for purpose, which no longer had to compete with other sports for usage.\nIn July 2020, the Japan Cricket Association won the Cricket 4 Good Initiative of the Year award, following the impact of Typhoon Hagibis, in the ICC's Annual Development Awards to recognise developing cricketing nations.\nOn January 31, 2024, the Japan Cricket Association rejoined the Asian Cricket Council (ACC).\nFuture Plans.\nFuture plans include a complete renewal of the playing fields which will host an ODI standard oval and a second oval meeting the Women's ODI standards. The ground will also have a newly built pavilion and an indoor training centre. The Japan Cricket Association is excited about the plans and looks forward to future developments."

        "text": "Group 10 is a rugby league competition in the Central West area of New South Wales, under the auspices of the New South Wales Rugby League. It had been under the control of Country Rugby League but that changed after the NSWRL agreed to a new constitution and the CRL voted to wind up its affairs immediately. The decisions was made on 19 October 2019 and the merger means that the aim of a unified administration of the sport in NSW was achieved over a year ahead of time.\nAhead of the 2022 season, the leading Group 10 and Group 11 first grade and under 18s clubs merged to form the Peter McDonald Premiership. From the 2022 season, Group 10 will only officially field reserve and women's league tag competitions, although a Group 10 Premier will still be crowned in First Grade and Under 18s, with this being the best team in the Group 10 Pool of the Peter McDonald Premiership. \nOrigin and formation.\nAt the end of the 1946 representative campaign, it was Bathurst that was crowned Western Challenge Cup premiers after finishing ahead of Lithgow, Orange and Oberon in the four-team group. The team's 7–0 win against Oberon in the final match of the round-robin competition in August at the Bathurst Sportsground saw the team finish the campaign undefeated.\nGroup 10 would meet two months later but Group 10 secretary Harley Brazil put forward a radical proposal, which alter the future of rugby league in the Central West region. Brazil put forward a \"scheme\" for an inter-town competition, with a goal to kick off in 1947. Brazil's idea was to see the leading eight teams in the Group (Bathurst Railway, Bathurst Waratahs, Lithgow Small Arms Factory, Lithgow Western Suburbs, Oberon, Orange Our Boys, Orange Waratahs and Portland) participate in the competition.\nWhen the districts met in February, not everyone accepted Brazil's proposal, which become referred to as the 'Brazil plan' by the local press. Representatives from Bathurst, Orange, Lithgow, Mudgee, Oberon, Blayney and Portland would debate over three proposals for several hours. The three proposals mentioned in the \"Lithgow Mercury\" on 26 February 1947 included:\nUltimately, it was the 'Brazil plan' that was adopted by 10 votes to eight but it was quickly followed by opposition from Orange and Bathurst.\nIssues continued and by Group 10's annual general meeting on 16 March, tensions reached boiling point between Orange and Bathurst and the other leagues. According to the \"Lithgow Mercury\", Bathurst and Orange were granted permission to conduct their own competitions, independent of the new inter-town club tournament.\nBrazil's plan for a new inter-town club competition was thrown into turmoil, with only four teams nominating, well below the secretary's eight-team dream. At the Group's meeting on 7 April, only Lithgow Small Arms Factory, Lithgow Western Suburbs, Oberon Tigers and Portland Colts had put their hands up for the new competition.\nThe first ever games in Group 10 had been locked in for Sunday, 13 April. Wests would play Oberon in Lithgow, while Portland would host Factory. Both games would kick-off at 3.15pm, with curtain-raisers the local Lithgow first grade competition games. Match reports in the \"Lithgow Mercury\" indicate Wests overcame the Tigers 17–3. C. Hallam scored the first try for Wests, which may have been the first ever try scored in the competition. In the other match, Portland downed Factory 14–7. Factory won the inaugural premiership by defeating Portland 17–7 in the grand final.\nOverview.\nThe current season format consists of fourteen rounds, with each team playing each other twice. The top five teams then play-off to the McIntyre final five system, culminating in the grand final which is held at the home ground of the major semi-final winner.\nFormer NRL players to play in Group 10 in recent times include Luke Branighan (Oberon and Bathurst St Patrick's) and Josh Starling (Oberon and Bathurst Panthers), with the latter signing on for the Panthers ahead of the 2020 season. Former Manly forward George Rose played one season for Oberon in 2016. NSW legend Mark O'Meley played a one-off game for St Pat's in 2016. Mick Sullivan has been one of the most influential ex-NRL players in recent times, leading Orange CYMS to five premierships during his nine-season stint between 2010 and 2018, a record haul for a captain-coach in the competition's history.\nCurrent clubs and location.\nFrom 2023, all four grades of Group 10 Clubs play in the Peter McDonald Premiership alongside Group 11 Rugby League clubs. Although a Group 10 Premier is still crowned in all grades, with this being the best team in the Group 10 Pool of the Peter McDonald Premiership. In 2022, Group 10 still officially fielded Reserve and women's League Tag competitions while the First Grade and Under 18s competitions were run as the Peter McDonald Premiership. "

The tournament was originally sponsored by Phonogram before changing its sponsor in 1975 to darts board manufacturer, Winmau. The World Masters was originally contested as the best of 5 legs (first to 3) before later transitioning to the set format.\nIt was previously the final leg of the BDO's Grand Slam title of televised majors, along with the BDO World Darts Championship, International Darts League and World Darts Trophy, until the latter two tournaments were axed in 2008. The champion is referred to as the World Master.\nThe tournament was unseeded for most of its history and all players entered the main draw in the first round. Seedings were introduced for the first time in 2007 at the behest of the BBC to ensure the top players were present for the televised stages of the event. Thus, the top eight ranked players received a bye to the last-16.\nAfter the collapse of the British Darts Organisation in September 2020, the World Darts Federation announced plans to launch the WDF World Masters. In December 2020, it was announced that the 2021 tournament will be held at De Bonte Wever in Assen, Netherlands. This was then pushed back to 2022 due to ongoing coronavirus restrictions. The new WDF version of the event changed the format from setplay to legplay for the first time, with significantly shorter matches. The 2023 edition was also cancelled.\nRecords.\nMost men's tournament wins 5 - Eric Bristow. \nBob Anderson and Martin Adams have both won 3 times (also both achieving 'hat tricks' by winning in three consecutive years), while Dave Whitcombe, John Lowe, Raymond van Barneveld, Stephen Bunting and Glen Durrant have all won the Masters twice.\nYoungest champion Michael van Gerwen (2006) aged 17 years, 174 days, who eclipsed the record of Eric Bristow\nDouble Champion Leeanne Maddock (1992) aged 17 years won both the youth title and the women's title.\nJoint World Championship &amp; Masters Champions Only seven players have ever won the World Masters and the World Championship in the same season. Eric Bristow achieved the feat three times (1979 Masters 1980 World, 1983–84 and 1984–85). Bob Anderson (1987–88), Richie Burnett (1994–95), John Walton (2000–01), Martin Adams (2009–10 and 2010–11), Stephen Bunting (2013–14) and Glen Durrant (2016–17) were the others. There have been two other instances of players holding both championships at the same time (Phil Taylor 1990 and Raymond van Barneveld 2005) - but these were not during the same season which is considered to end with the World Championship.\nNot Dropping A Set Stephen Bunting's 2013 win was achieved without dropping a set.\nThere are 15 players who have won the Masters and the BDO World Championship during their careers: John Lowe, Eric Bristow, Bob Anderson, Phil Taylor, Dennis Priestley, Richie Burnett, Steve Beaton, Raymond van Barneveld, Les Wallace, John Walton, Andy Fordham, Martin Adams, Scott Waites, Stephen Bunting, and Glen Durrant. Additionally, Michael van Gerwen won the Masters in 2006 and has since won the PDC World Championship three times, but not the BDO World Championship.\nMedia coverage.\nThe 2011 tournament was also shown in the United States for the first time with ESPN3 broadcasting it."

Opener Davey Jacobs hit an unbeaten half-century in reply, as Eagles overcame the target of 104 inside 11.4 of the 20 allotted overs.\n1st One-day International, 15 September.\nVusimuzi Sibanda top scored for Zimbabwe with his fifth One-day International half-century, as the only one to pass 40 in South Africa's innings. Justice Chibhabha and Hamilton Masakadza contributed 30s as Zimbabwe made it 137 for two after the 33rd over, but the last 17 provided runs at a slower rate as Jacques Kallis, Makhaya Ntini and Shaun Pollock kept the run rate when they bowled below three an over. Robin Peterson's five overs cost 35, however, and he was the least economical bowler of the match (excluding Hamilton Masakadza who didn't bowl a full over).\nSouth Africa lost their first three wickets within 10 overs, scoring 33 as Loots Bosman, Herschelle Gibbs and Jacques Kallis, but a 121-run partnership between Boeta Dippenaar and J. P. Duminy left 48 runs from the remaining 17 overs. Despite wickets from Stuart Matsikenyeri and Ed Rainsford, South Africa made it through with five wickets to spare.\n2nd One-day International (Replay), 18 September.\nThe Second ODI was initially scheduled to be played on 17 September but was abandoned without a ball being bowled. It was replayed on 18 September. Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bat first. Chamu Chibhabha top scored for the tourists with 38 off 101 balls. Elton Chigumbura made 30 while Tafadzwa Mufambisi and Prosper Utseya contributed 20s as Zimbabwe were bundled out for 152 inside 50 overs. Andrew Hall was the pick of the South African bowlers picking up 3 wickets for 23 runs. Makhaya Ntini, Robin Peterson and Jacques Kallis picked up 2 wickets each.\nBoeta Dippenaar was the first wicket to fall for South Africa in the 4th over. However Loots Bosman played aggressively to score 38 runs off just 29 balls hitting 2 sixes in the process. By the time Jacques Kallis fell, South Africa needed 43 runs from 184 balls. J. P. Duminy and Justin Kemp took South Africa home inside 30 overs. Andrew Hall was declared Man of the Match.\n3rd One-day International, 20 September.\nZimbabwe were \"beaten to their knees by a brutal display of power\" that began with the openers Loots Bosman and Alviro Petersen before Mark Boucher came in and registered his first one-day century in his 220th match, and also the second quickest of all time. This was the fourth total of more than 400 in ODI history, and the second time in four games that South Africa scored more than 400. Both the openers scored 80s, and Bosman was the first to fall with the score on 160 in the 21st over. Captain Jacques Kallis scored a 50 off 59 balls. However it was Mark Boucher who turned out to be the hero of the day. He scored 147 off just 68 balls which included 10 sixes. Zimbabwe's \"shoddy\" fielding helped: he was dropped six times. Ed Rainsford was the only Zimbabwean bowler whose economy rate was below 6 runs per over, though Prosper Utseya and Tafadzwa Kamungozi picked up two wickets each but went for 77 and 70 runs respectively.\nThe match \"effectively ended after the first innings\", according to the Cricinfo report, as Zimbabwe batted out the 50 overs without losing wickets. Terry Duffin led the resistance with a defiant 87, supported by Chamu Chibhabha and Hamilton Masakadza, with whom he added 94 and 102 for the second and third wickets. Zimbabwe finished with 247 for 4, their highest total of the series, and their highest total against a top-eight nation (the Test nations excluding 10th-ranked Bangladesh), since May 2006."

        "text": "The Ireland men's national basketball team () represents the island of Ireland in international basketball. It is governed by Basketball Ireland with players from both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Ireland plays their home matches at the National Basketball Arena in Tallaght, Dublin.\nIreland has little history on the international stage, as they have yet to qualify for top tournaments such as the EuroBasket or the FIBA World Cup. However, the national team did manage to reach the Summer Olympics once, in 1948.\nHistory.\nThe Amateur Basketball Association of Ireland (ABAI; now Basketball Ireland) was formed in 1945 and affiliated to FIBA in 1947. An indoor version of basketball had been played in the Irish Army from 1936, but using non-standard rules to create an indoor winter substitute for Gaelic football; until 1943, the Army Athletic Council officially recognized only Gaelic games. The ABAI sent a team of the best Army players to the 1948 Olympic tournament in nearby London, despite the refusal of Army command to release the players for intensive training. The team coaches were officers unfamiliar with the sport, who outranked the players and ignored their advice. Although many top sides were absent from the London Games in the aftermath of World War II, the Irish team finished last, losing every match heavily; the worst a 71–9 loss to Mexico, who finished fourth. Only two members of the team were over tall.\nThe team's standard improved gradually from the 1970s to the 2000s, as more school leavers won scholarships to play US college basketball, and some Irish American professional players took up eligibility to compete for their ancestral country. Ireland entered European-zone Olympic qualification tournaments in 1972, 1976, 1984, and 1988, losing every match each time. In 1988, Ireland finished runner-up in the inaugural Promotion Cup, the third tier of EuroBasket, later named EuroBasket Division C, and now the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries. In 1993, the National Basketball Arena opened in Dublin, which became the team's new permanent home. Division C was hosted there the following year, and Ireland beat Cyprus 81–78 in the final to gain promotion to EuroBasket Division B. Ireland narrowly failed to win promotion to Division A in FIBA EuroBasket 2005 Division B, losing to Denmark by 4 points after having won the first game in Dublin by 10 points.\nIn February 2010, during the Irish financial crisis, Basketball Ireland announced that it was €1.2m in debt and was deactivating its senior international squads to cut costs. In December 2015, the team was reactivated for 2016.\nIn December 2015, it was announced that Ireland would play at the 2016 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries. The team finished in the fourth position overall.\nIreland played in the 2018 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries, held in San Marino from 26 June to 1 July. Ireland finished (1–1) in group play, losing to Malta then defeating Andorra. In the semi-finals Ireland lost to Norway, sending the team to the bronze medal match where they defeated Gibraltar to finish in third place.\nThree years later, Ireland hosted the 2021 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries in Dublin. The national team would go undefeated during the tournament at (4–0), to capture their second title at the competition all time.\nTeam.\nCurrent roster.\nRoster for the 2027 FIBA World Cup Pre-Qualifiers matches on 22 and 25 February 2024 against Kosovo and Switzerland.\nPast rosters.\n1948 Olympic Games: finished 23rd among 23 teams\n4 Donald O'Donovan, 5 Frank O'Connor, 6 Paddy Crehan, 7 Jimmy McGee, 8 Bill Jackson, 9 Harry Boland, 10 Tommy Keenan, 12 Dermot Sheriff, 13 Danny Reddin, 14 Paddy Sheriff, 15 Jim Flynn, 16 Christy Walsh (Coach: Donald McCormack)\n2016 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries: finished 4th among 8 teams\n2018 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries: finished 3rd among 7 teams\n2021 FIBA European Championship for Small Countries: finished 1st among 5 teams\nKit.\nManufacturer.\n2016: Macron"

        "text": "The Luxembourg national cricket team is the team that represents Luxembourg in international cricket. The Luxembourg Cricket Federation became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1998 and an associate member in 2017.\nGround.\nLuxembourg's home ground is at the Pierre Werner Cricket Ground, in Walferdange which belongs to the country's largest club, the Optimists Cricket Club. The ground is named after the late Pierre Werner, a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg (1959–74, 1979–84). Werner had fallen in love with cricket when living in London in 1930, and went on to become the Honorary President of the OCC, which had been established when he was Prime Minister. Werner opened the OCC's new ground in 1992. Widely viewed as one of the best cricket grounds in mainland Europe (excluding grounds in the Netherlands), the ground lies in the picturesque setting just ten minutes from Luxembourg City center. It boasts a large outfield (with two tracks laid on different bases), four practice bays, a clubhouse with catering facilities, a cricket/tennis pavilion and various other amenities.\nHistory.\nLuxembourg men's international debut came at the 1990 European Cricketer Cup, a European Cricket Council tournament. Outside of occasional matches against Belgium, the team did not return to international level until 2003, when they finished last in the ECC Trophy, an eleven-team tournament for ICC affiliate members. The following year, they took part in the ECC Representative Championship in Slovenia, finishing in fifth place, nearly upsetting Croatia, and completing their first international win, against Bulgaria.\nIn 2006, Luxembourg took part in Division Four of the European Championship in Belgium, beating Finland, losing narrowly to Slovenia, and losing in the last over against Cyprus. Having narrowly missed out on promotion in 2006, they would play in Division Four again in 2009.\nIn 2009, Luxembourg again participated in Division Four of the ICC European Championship in Limassol, Cyprus. It won two games, against Slovenia and Finland, and lost three, finishing 4th out of six competing nations. The Luxembourg team won the Spirit of Cricket award.\nIn 2011, following a restructuring of the ICC European Divisions, Luxembourg participated in the ICC Europe Division 2 (T20) Championship, which took place in Belgium and involved 11 teams. Following a victory over Cyprus in the group stage, Luxembourg advanced to the 5th–8th place play-off where they eventually finished 8th. Belgium beat Austria in the final and both teams were promoted to ICC Europe Division 1.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Luxembourg and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 will be a full T20I. Luxembourg played their first T20I match against Turkey on 29 August 2019 during the 2019 Continental Cup in Romania.\nLuxembourg women played as an international team for the first time in September 2021, in a friendly match against Belgium (who were preparing for a series of T20Is against Austria in Vienna). Playing at the Robert Schuman Oval in Évrange, Belgium scored 163 for 7 (Siofra Lawlor 2-24, Lydie Wykes-Templeman 2-30, Stella Wykes-Templeman 1-24). In reply Luxembourg scored 136 for 6, losing by 27 runs. Captain Kerry Fraser (15) and Lydie Wykes-Templeman (49) put on 118 for the second wicket. Lydie Wykes-Templeman went on to play T20Is for France in 2022.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all the players who have played for Luxembourg in the past 12 months or have been part of the latest T20I squad.

        "text": "Loran Errol Thompson (born May 28, 1950) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey winger who played most of his NHL career with the Toronto Maple Leafs. He was selected 2nd (22nd overall) by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1970 Amateur Draft. Thompson is also a former captain of the Detroit Red Wings.\nJunior and senior leagues.\nThompson started turning heads at a young age while playing for the Halifax Jr. Canadians of the NSJHL. In the 1967–68 season, he scored 81 points in only 45 games, cementing him as a legitimate scoring winger. However, in 1969 Thompson was still an undiscovered talent playing in P.E.I.'s Southern New Brunswick Senior Hockey League senior league with the Charlottetown Royals for $15 a game when he was spotted by legendary Leaf goalie-turned-scout Johnny Bower. He was drafted 22nd overall in the 1970 Amateur NHL Draft and made his NHL debut in 1970, playing in only one game. He played the rest of that year and the next on Toronto's minor league club, the Tulsa Oilers of the Central Hockey League.\nNHL career.\nIn 1972, Thompson was called up to play full-time for Toronto and with his blazing speed and scoring touch quickly established himself as a reliable offensive NHL talent. On a Leaf team that lost more games than it won, he scored 32 points in his first NHL season. Thompson began improving with each year and in the 1974–75 season scored 25 goals. Next season, on a line with Darryl Sittler and Lanny McDonald, he scored 43 goals, becoming the second player in Leaf history, after Frank Mahovlich, to score 40 goals in a season. The Thompson-Sittler-McDonald line became well known throughout North America after Sittler set an NHL record with ten points in one game on February 7, 1976.\nAfter breaking his arm in the 1976–77 season, Thompson missed one half of the season but still managed 21 goals. The offensively talented winger began to see less ice time under defense-oriented coach Roger Neilson and was eventually traded with various draft picks to the Detroit Red Wings for Dan Maloney and a future second round draft pick, on March 13, 1978. With Detroit, Thompson continued to produce, scoring 23 goals his first full season and 34 goals the following season. In 1980, he was named co-captain of the Wings, splitting time with Reed Larson. After scoring 26 points in the 1980–81 season he was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for Gary McAdam on January 8 and played his final 34 games in Pittsburgh."

        "text": "Gary Wilkinson is an English rugby league coach who was head coach of the Sheffield Eagles and subsequently in temporary charge of Doncaster.\nWilkinson had a career as a player in the amateur leagues in Hull before moving into coaching where he proved he could develop young players and produce winning teams. After a successful spell as Hull Kingston Rovers's Academy boss he took over the first team in 2002, winning the Northern Rail Cup and reaching the quarter-finals of the promotion play-offs. He fell victim to changing fortunes in the Hull Kingston Rovers' boardroom and moved on to Hull F.C. as under-21s coach and had a brief spell on the backroom staff at Doncaster. In 2004 he was appointed coach of the successful GB Students' squad. In 2006 he was head coach of the Sheffield Eagles.\nWilkinson was a part-time coach at the Eagles, on weekdays he runs a pest control business in Hull. When he was appointed at the start of the 2006 season he immediately helped the Eagles by bringing in players from the Hull area and from the student game. The team took time to gel but eventually finished second in National League Two after an eleven-game unbeaten run, qualifying for the play-offs. They then beat Crusaders and Swinton to gain promotion to National League One. He resigned as the Eagles' head coach on 15 October 2006, citing personal reasons.\nIn April 2007 Wilkinson made a dramatic return to rugby league coaching when he took temporary charge of Doncaster following the suspension of their coach Keiran Dempsey and his assistant. His first game in charge was against the Sheffield Eagles at the Don Valley Stadium and Wilkinson's team recorded a victory by 24 points to 20. In May 2007 Doncaster entered into a CVA to avoid potential liquidation and Wilkinson was told not to continue as coach."

Founded in 1979 by the husband-and-wife team of Frank and Vivian Barning, who served as editor and publisher, respectively, the magazine was published on a monthly basis until 1993.\nOverview.\nThe first issue appeared in March 1979. Vivian Barning has been a card collector as a child, and came back to the hobby with her husband in 1975. For most of its run, it appeared in a newspaper-style format, although it later converted to a tabloid size with a color cover.\nThe magazine primarily focussed on baseball cards, but also included coverage of many other baseball-related collectibles, including autographs, press pins, postcards, stamps, uniforms and other pieces of game-used equipment, and books and other publications. As its name implies, the paper placed an emphasis on news, offering extensive coverage of newly released cards and memorabilia, as well as reporting on developments within the hobby itself. It also featured more nostalgic pieces, including articles on older memorabilia as well as interviews with baseball players of the past. There were also frequent articles aimed at new collectors, offering advice on how to get started in the hobby.\nThe publication originally was based in Glen Cove, New York. It moved to San Diego, California in 1982. The Barnings wrote many articles themselves, but also used contributions from a growing staff of writers and columnists.\nIn 1982 the packaging of Fleer's baseball card set touted that their 1981 set had been named the best of the year by Baseball Hobby News. \nContents.\nSome of the regular features in \"Baseball Hobby News\" for at least parts of its run include:"

        "text": "The Ladbrokes UK Open is a ranking major darts tournament held annually at the Butlins Minehead Resort by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC) in England. The event is often referred to as the \"FA Cup of darts\" as it has an unseeded open draw made after each round, and entry is open to players at all levels of darts. One-hundred-and-sixty players compete in the multi-board event over eight-stages before the PDC’s Top 32 enter the tournament in the fourth round. The tournament has a prize fund of £600,000; the victor’s prize is £110,000.\nHistory.\nFrom 2003 to 2013, the UK Open took place in June each year at the Reebok Stadium, in Bolton. In 2014, it moved to Butlin's Minehead taking place in early March. Phil Taylor beat Shayne Burgess in the inaugural final. Dutchman Raymond van Barneveld won the tournament in 2006, in his first appearance in a PDC ranking event. He knocked out 13-times World Champion Phil Taylor 11–10 en route to the final where he beat Barrie Bates 13–7. He also successfully defended the title in 2007, again beating Taylor en route.\nAs the event has amateur and semi-professional qualifiers, it has produced some upset results over the years. In 2014, Aden Kirk, playing in his first televised match, beat defending and five-time champion Phil Taylor 9–7 in the third round. Kirk then beat Peter Wright 9–5 in the next round. In 2016, Rileys amateur qualifier Barry Lynn recorded a 9–3 win over reigning world champion Gary Anderson and reached the quarter-finals. A year later, Anderson lost to another Rileys qualifier, Paul Hogan, who followed up by beating Adrian Lewis in the next round.\nTaylor achieved the perfect nine-dart finish four times (2004, 2005, 2007 &amp; 2008). Mervyn King (2010), Gary Anderson (2012), Wes Newton (2013), Michael van Gerwen (2016 &amp; 2020), Jonny Clayton (2020), Sebastian Białecki (2021), Jitse van der Wal (2021), José Justicia (2022), James Wade (2022) and Michael Smith (2022) have also achieved a nine-dart leg (although Newton's, Białecki’s, van der Wal’s and Justicia's were not televised live, while Clayton's and Smith's were only live on the PDC website). The tournament had a different runner-up for the first 13 years.\nBecause of extreme weather conditions and fears for the safety of visiting fans the unprecedented decision was taken by the host venue Butlins to play the entire 2018 UK Open behind closed doors leaving the public only being able to watch the event though ITV4’s live coverage and the PDC live web feed.\nThe Tournament was moved to the Marshall Arena in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and played behind closed doors.\nFormat.\nQualifying events for amateur players are organised by Rileys and held in various locations across the UK. 16 players qualify through these events.\nThe format is as follows (as of 2020):\nThe draws for the first three rounds are made in full after all qualifying players are known, while the draws for the fourth round onward are made separately on stage as soon as each preceding round has concluded.\nRecords and statistics.\nNine-dart finishes.\nFifteen nine-darters have been thrown at the UK Open. The first one was in 2004, and eleven of them have been televised. Wes Newton in 2013, Sebastian Białecki and Jitse van der Wal in 2021 and José Justicia in 2022 hit nine-darters that were not broadcast.\n not televised\nMedia coverage.\nFrom 2003 until 2013, coverage for the UK Open was shown on Sky Sports in June.

In the domestic T20 competition, Western Province/Cape Cobras won twice between 2003 and 2022.\nTraditionally, the team's home ground is Newlands in Cape Town. Under Cape Cobras this was expanded to incorporate Boland Park in Paarl. Western Province currently compete in the CSA 4-Day Domestic Series, CSA One-Day Cup and the CSA T20 Challenge.\nHistory.\nCape Colony.\nCricket in South Africa, like many other Commonwealth nations, was first introduced by the British when the Cape Colony was ceded to Great Britain by the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814. By the middle of the 19th century cricket was well established in Cape Town, with Cape Colony Schools adopting the game by the 1850s as the sport gradually expanding further inland by settlers. In 1862, an annual fixture called 'Mother Country v Colonial Born' was hosted for the first time in Cape Town, with popularity leading to the founding of Western Province Cricket Club in October 1864. In 1876, Port Elizabeth began the 'Chamption Bat Tournament' between teams representing the major settlements of the Cape Colony, such as Cape Town, Grahamston, Kingwilliamstown and Port Elizabeth. The settlement-based format continued until the 1890–91 season when Western Province, Eastern Province and Griqualand took to the field for the first time instead.\nWestern Province Currie Cup.\nSir Donald Currie, the founder of the Castle Shipping Line and the sponsor of the 1889 English tour, donated a trophy for the champions of the promising domestic competition. The 'Currie Cup' was first awarded to Kimberley, who had beaten Transvaal in the single match competition of 1889–90. From 1892 to 1893, the competition began to take the familiar form of province-based competition in a champion format, inspired by the English County Cricket structure.\nWestern Province joined the competition for the 1892–93 season, winning the Cup on its first attempt. The Currie Cup was not contested every year, and a total of fourteen seasons were contested between its inception and the First World War. Aside from an interruption during the Boer War, typically seasons were not held when the English team were touring. The competition took on several different formats, including a knock-out structure, and a round-robin followed by a challenge final against the previous year's winner; but in 1906–07, a round-robin league format was established, which would be unchanged until 1982–83. Between 1892–93 and 1912–13, Western Province won the Cup five times, being particularly dominate in the 1890s.\nIn the interwar years, again the Currie Cup was not competed every year. Largely due to travel constraints, the Cup was not held in seasons when there was a Test tour of South Africa. Of the 12 seasons played, Western Province won two in an era of Transvaal dominance. First-class cricket was later suspended upon the outset of the Second World War in 1939 as South Africa declared war on Germany.\nWestern Province won a further eight Cups between 1946 and 1991 in sporadic fashion, with the team failing to win the title at any point in the 1960s. At the end of the 1965–66 season, Western Province were relegated to the Second Division for the first time since the two division format was introduced in 1951. They would later be promoted back to the First Division for the 1969–70 season, going on to share the title with Transvaal. From 1972, the two division format was retained but promotion and relegation scrapped, with the top division remaining constant with five teams: Transvaal, Natal, Eastern Province, Western Province and Rhodesia. By this time the stronger provinces had begun fielding a 'B Team' in the lower division, although could not be promoted. From 1975, Western Province fielded a 'B Team' of their own, however the lower division eventually split away to form the 'Castle Bowl' – in essence a separate Currie Cup Second XI Competition.\nThe dominance of the Transvaal, Natal and Western Province finally came to a close after Eastern Province beat Transvaal at the end of the 1988–89 season. Prior to, the three teams had amongst them won 59 of the 60 Currie Cups contested, with the exception being Kimberley's win in 1890–91.\nWestern Province was largely immune to the political changes after 1994 that altered the domestic structure. Whereas many teams changed name, for instance Transvaal to Gauteng in 1997, Western Province continued until the Franchise Era of 2004–2021.\nDuring this time, one-day cricket was included in the domestic structure, with its matches having List-A status. Western Province won five one-day titles between 1981–82 and 2003–04, with three being back to back between 1985 and 1988.\nFranchise era.\nIn 2004–05, the format of South African domestic cricket was changed entirely. The eleven provincial teams were rationalised into six entirely professional new teams, for all three formats. Western Province merged with Boland to form the Cape Cobras, being based in Cape Town. With the Currie Cup now called SuperSport Series for commercial reasons, the six new franchises were intended to create a stronger top-tier sides with a second-tier semi-professional tournament based around the old provincial teams.\nPlaying 17 first-class seasons, the Cape Cobras were the second most successful team behind Titans with 4 outright titles. In the one-day series, Cape Cobras managed two outright and two shared wins, the most recent being 2013–2014. A T20 league had also been devised for the domestic structure within South Africa, with Cape Cobras securing two title wins by 2021–22.\nRecent history.\nIn 2020, domestic cricket in South Africa was restructured once more and the six former franchise teams were dropped. In its place was a return to the more traditional two-division league format, with a total of fifteen professional teams competing. For this, the previously semi-professional provincial cricket competition was absorbed, effectively forming the league's second division. Promotion and relegation between the two divisions, not seen since the start of the franchise era in 2004, will return after the 2023–24 season. From 2019, provinces and cricket unions submitted bids to CSA to make a case to be considered for the top division for the initial two seasons. The bidding process was overseen by the Independent Evaluation Committee (IEE) who took into account a range of criteria, such as cricketing and financial operations, women's and age-group development, transformation policies and stadium infrastructure. Eight teams make up the first division, with 16 contracted players each, and seven teams the second division, with 11 contracted players each, taking the total number of professional players to 205.\nMany of the provinces elected to keep their previous franchise branding, even with a return to the more traditional province defined structure. Of the First Division, only Cape Cobras elected to return to their former name of Western Province.\nCurrent squad.\n\"As of April 2023\"\nCoaching staff.\nSalieg Nackerdien is Head Coach of the side, having been appointed in September 2021 after replacing acting coach Faiek Davids. Nackerdien's most recent position was as batting consultant to Boland Cricket and before that as Momentum Proteas Women's Assistant Coach. From 2009 to 2016, Nackerdien served in various coaching capacities during the former franchise era of the Cape Cobras. He was also Head Coach of the semi-professional Western Province team and headed the WP Academy.\nFormer Western Province and Cape Cobras bowler Rory Kleinveldt has been appointed as the bowling coach, whilst Dieter Swanepoel has been appointed the new strength and conditioning coach after working with the Momentum Multiply Titans, Cape Cobras and WP semi-professional team. Shane Jabaar continues as team physio, and Romano Ramoo continues as the video analyst. Israar Roman completes the management team as the team and logistics coordinator.\nYouth cricket.\nThe RPCs and Hubs programme plays a key role in identifying players from previously disadvantaged areas to be a part of an organised, high-performance environment within their communities and structures. This has the aim of reshaping the cricketing landscape and changing lives through developing the raw skills of kids from non-traditional feeder systems.\nWestern Province HUBS are as follows:\nPlaying kit.\nDuring the Momentum 1 Day Cup and 2016–17 CSA T20 Challenge, the Cobras played in blue shirts and trousers with slight yellow accents as well as orange and blue kits to represent their sponsor's corporate colours.\nVenues.\nVenues have included:"

        "text": "Championship recognition.\nPublic Acclamation: 1884 to 1921.\nChampions were recognized by wide public acclamation. A heavyweight champion was a boxer who had a notable win over another notable boxer and then went without defeat. Retirements from the ring periodically led to a \"true\" champion going unrecognized, or for several to be recognized by the public for periods of time. Typically, public interest in having a single, \"true\" champion resulted in claimants to the heavyweight title being matched with one another; the winner of that bout was subsequently deemed the champion, with the claim (and title lineage) of the defeated boxer largely forgotten.\nSanctioning Bodies: 1921 to present.\nThe National Boxing Association (NBA), was formed in 1921 as the first organization aimed at regulating boxing on a national (and later global) level. The prominence of New York City as the epicenter of boxing would lead to a governmental entity, the powerful New York State Athletic Commission (NYSAC), to join the NBA in sanctioning bouts as \"world championships.\" A third entity, with lesser public recognition inside the USA, the European Boxing Union (EBU), would follow suit, with this triumvirate typically (but not always) recognizing the same boxers as world champions.\nAt its 1962 convention the NBA's non-U.S. members exploited a membership rule and took control of the organization, rebranding it the World Boxing Association. The (WBA), was joined a year later by a combination of state and national boxing commissions (including the NYSAC and IBU) to form a separate sanctioning body, the World Boxing Council (WBC). Each organization would later have a spin-off competing sanctioning body emerge: the International Boxing Federation (IBF), which was formed by members of the United States Boxing Association in 1983; and the World Boxing Organization (WBO), which was formed in 1989. A fifth significant (but not as publicly accepted) body came in the form of the International Boxing Organization (IBO), in 1991, and today there are over a dozen sanctioning organizations, of varying degrees of public acceptance, sanctioning bouts as for a world championship and proclaiming their title winners \"Champion of the World.\""

        "text": "The Pakistan national field hockey team () represents Pakistan in international field hockey. Having played its first match in 1948, it is administered by the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF), the governing body for hockey in Pakistan. It has been a member of the International Hockey Federation (FIH) since 1948 and was founding member of the Asian Hockey Federation (ASHF), which was formed in 1958.\nPakistan is one of the most successful national field hockey teams in the world with a record four Hockey World Cup wins (in 1971, 1978, 1982, and 1994).\nPakistan national team has played in all FIH World Cup editions with the only absence coming in 2014 and 2023. The Green Shirts are also most successful national team in the Asian Games, with eight gold medals: 1958, 1962, 1970, 1974, 1978, 1982, 1990, and 2010, the highest number of times a country has come first, and the only Asian team to have won the prestigious Champions Trophy, with three championships: 1978, 1980 and 1994. Pakistan has won a total of 29 official international titles to professional and grassroots level selections, with three gold medals in the Olympic Games field hockey tournaments: in Rome 1960, Mexico City 1968, and Los Angeles 1984.\nField hockey is the national sport of the country. The Pakistan national team has been ranked as the #1 team in the world in both 2000 and 2001 by the FIH. Former captain Sohail Abbas holds the World Record for the most international goals scored by a player in the history of international field hockey. Waseem Ahmad is the most-capped player for the team, having played 410 times between 1996 and 2013.\nPakistan is known for having fierce rivalry with India, having a record of playing each other in South Asian Games and Asian Games finals. They have competed against one another in 20 major tournaments finals so far, out of which Pakistan has won 13 titles in total. Pakistan have a record of winning the first three championships of Hockey Asia Cup in 1982, 1985 and 1989 against India in row. Apart from that, Pakistan has notable competitive rivalries with Netherlands and Australia.\nPakistan's home ground is National Hockey Stadium in Lahore. The current team head coach is Shahnaz Sheikh and the team manager is Saeed Khan.\nHistory.\nEarly history (1948–1955).\nOriginally, the game had been brought by British servicemen to British India, and like cricket it soon became a popular sport with the local population. Following the independence of Pakistan in 1947, soon after the Pakistan Hockey Federation came into being in 1948. Prior to the partition of India, players playing for Pakistan competed for the Indian side. The Federation soon established and organized the Provincial Hockey/Sports Associations of West Punjab, East Bengal, Sindh, Balochistan, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, Bahawalpur &amp; Services Sports Board. Despite the limited resources available on 2 August 1948, Pakistan national team, led by Ali Iqtidar Shah Dara, officially went on to play their first international game against Belgium winning the game 2–1 at the 1948 London Olympics. Pakistan remained unbeaten defeating the Netherlands, Denmark and France during the group stage round and ended up placing fourth. During the group stages Pakistan defeat of Netherlands by 6–1 was the highlight for the team. Following the Olympics Pakistan went on a tour of Europe where the played Belgium, Netherlands and Italy and remained undefeated during the tour.\nThe next international outing of the team came after a gap of two years when Pakistan participated in an invitational competition in Spain in 1950. Pakistan were declared joined winners with Netherlands after the final ended in a draw and organizers decided to end the game rather than going for a deciding period of play, this was Pakistan's first international tournament victory. Again there was a gap of two years before Pakistan again appeared in an international event and this time it was the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki. Pakistan won the first knock-out game against France 6–0 but lost to Netherlands and Great Britain to again finish fourth at the event. Over the four years Pakistan made tours to European teams and also hosted them in their own country and in Asia Pakistan particularly made regular tours to Malaysia and Singapore with whom they played quite a few times.\nRise in Olympics and Asian honors (1956–1970).\nPakistan won their first Olympic medal in 1956 at Melbourne when they reached the final but lost to India 1–0 to earn a silver medal, first podium finish this was also Pakistan's first medal at the Olympics. Field hockey was included in the Asian Games for the first time in 1958 at Tokyo. Pakistan were drawn against Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and archrivals India. They beat Japan 5–0 in their first match, then followed two consecutive victories over South Korea (8–0) and Malaysia (6–0). In the last match Pakistan drew 0–0 with India finishing top of the table in the round-robin format and clinched its first gold medal in an international competition.\nIn 1960 Rome Olympics where Pakistan played against in a group with Australia, Poland and Japan, winning all the matches. Pakistan then played the quarter-final round with Germany, winning the match 2–1 and advanced to the semi-final round where they defeated Spain. Pakistan eventually won the gold medal, defeating India 1–0 with a goal by Naseer Bunda in the final round held at the Olympic Velodrome and ended India's run of six successive gold medals at the Summer Olympic Games.\nIn the 1962 Asian Games, Pakistan earned its second gold medal with Chaudhry Ghulam Rasool as the captain leading the team to another successive award. However, during the 1964 Tokyo Olympics the national team ended up as runners-up for the second time after losing 1–0 to India in the final as well as finishing runners-up in the 1966 Asian Games held in Bangkok, Thailand.\nPakistan won its second Olympic Games gold medal in Mexico at the 1968 Summer Olympics. It fielded what has since then often been considered the best hockey squad ever led by captain Tariq Aziz with Saeed Anwar, Khalid Mahmood, Gulraiz Akhtar and Tariq Niazi. Even though Rasool had retired, this team was still a force to be reckoned with. They won all six of their games—against Kenya, Great Britain, Malaysia, Australia, France and the Netherlands during group play, and against West Germany in the knockout round. Pakistan made the final for the fourth straight Olympics, and won the gold medal, as they had in 1960, this time by defeating Australia, 2–1 with goals from Muhammad Asad Malik and Abdul Rashid. Rashid was the top scorer for Pakistan with seven goals; Tanvir Dar finished with six goals.\nThe Golden Era (1970–1984).\nIn the group stage of the 1970 Asian Games, Pakistan was competing with tournament hosts Thailand and contenders Japan for top spot and a place in the finals. In their first match of the group, Pakistan scored thrice against Japan to clinch their first win, followed by defeating Hong Kong 10–0 to go to the top of the group. The team then draw 0–0 with Thailand and progressed to the knock-out round, where they won 5–0 over Malaysia. In the final, Pakistan faced India, winning 1–0 and sealing their third Asian Games gold medal.\nIn 1971, the first-ever Hockey World Cup was to be hosted by Pakistan. However, political issues would prevent that first competition from being played in Pakistan. The FIH had inadvertently scheduled the first World Cup to be played in Pakistan during the Bangladesh Liberation War. Furthermore, Pakistan and India had been at war with each other only six years earlier. When Pakistan invited India to compete in the tournament, a crisis arose. Pakistanis, led by cricketer Abdul Hafeez Kardar, protested against India's participation in the Hockey World Cup. Given the intense political climate between Pakistan and India, the FIH decided to move the tournament elsewhere. In March 1971, coincidentally in the same month Bangladesh declared independence from Pakistan, the FIH decided to move the first Hockey World Cup to the Real Club de Polo grounds in Barcelona, Spain, which was considered a neutral and peaceful European site. On 27 March 1971, in Brussels, the trophy was formally handed to FIH President Rene Frank by H.E Masood, the Pakistani Ambassador to Belgium. A total number of 10 teams qualified for the event and were broken up into two groups.\nThe Pakistani team was drawn in a group with hosts Spain, Australia, Japan and the Netherlands. The group was topped by Spain and Pakistan respectively, and both the teams advanced into the semi-finals. In the first semi-final of the tournament Pakistan ousted India 2–1 in a tense and closely contested game and in the second semi-final Spain played safe and defeated a spirited Kenya 1–0 to enter the finals against Pakistan. In the final Pakistan scored early but then strengthened its defense to hold out a 1–0 victory and win the first hockey World Cup, retaining its number one position in the world hockey rankings, closely followed by India and the Netherlands. Tanvir Dar finished as the top goal scorer at the tournament with eight goals.\nThe 1972 Munich Olympics, Pakistan lost the final to hosts West Germany losing the game 1–0 with a goal by Michael Krause and finished at fourth place, the following year, in the 1973 Hockey World Cup. The national team made a comeback in the international competition, by winning and retaining their title at the 1974 Asian Games but lost to their rivals India in the finals of the third hockey World Cup in 1975. 1976 Montreal Olympics saw the team secure their first bronze medal in the competition.\nThe year 1978 saw Pakistan national team win three major international tournaments: the third Hockey World Cup held at Buenos Aires, Argentina along with 1978 Asian Games and the first Champions Trophy. This was the first time a national team won three major titles in the history of international field hockey. In 1980, Pakistan Olympic Association, along with 65 countries, boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This resulted in Pakistan hockey team not participating at the field hockey competition at the tournament. Pakistan hosted the 1980 and 1981 Champions Trophy tournaments, winning the title against West Germany in the final round in 1980 and finishing at fourth position a year later, held at the Hockey Club of Pakistan, Karachi. In the 1980s Pakistan won every international tournament it participated in including the 1982 World Cup in Mumbai and the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles where Pakistan won the gold medal defeating West Germany in the final. Pakistan also won the Asian Games and Asia Cup consecutively in this period.\nSurface change crisis and resurgence (1986–1996).\nAlthough hockey was being played at synthetic surfaces from the 1970s but it was only until the 1986 World Cup in London the FIH completely moved on from grass pitches to AstroTurf, synthetic turf made from plastic fibers to give a grass like look. The change of surface made the game much more fasted paced and to align the game with the new conditions the governing body vastly changed the rules of the game which focused more on strength and pace rather than stick work and technique which was the hallmark of Asian style of hockey. This negatively effected Pakistan since they couldn't replace all of the grass pitches with more expensive synthetic surfaces compared to more affluent European nations. This resulted in Pakistan performing very poorly at the World Cup in London where they won just one pool game and finished second last at 11th place. Pakistan however managed to cope up with the new changes in the game in the following years and started to regain some of its past dominance. Pakistan first finished runner-up at the 1990 World Cup at home in Lahore after losing the final to Netherlands and won a bronze medal at the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. The most glorious highlight of the decade came in 1994 when Pakistan first won the 1994 Champions Trophy at home ground, their first title in the competition after 14 years and later in the year Pakistan won the Hockey World Cup in Sydney after winning a penalty shootout against Netherlands.\nPost-Atlanta Olympics (1998–2006).\nAfter Atlanta 1996 the first major competition was the 1998 Hockey World Cup in Utrecht Pakistan finished 5th at the tournament. The following year Pakistan won the Sultan Azlan Shah Cup for the first time in 1999. Pakistan finished fourth at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney after losing the bronze medal match to Australia, this was the last time Pakistan played for a medal at the Olympics. Pakistan finished 5th at 2002 World Cup and Kuala Lumpur and won bronze medal at the Champions Trophy the same year. At the 2002 Asian Games Pakistan finished fourth, the first time the team didn't won a medal at the competition. In 2003 Pakistan lost the Hockey Asia Cup final to India and in 2004 Pakistan had a busy schedule where they played in many tournaments in lead up to the Olympics but Pakistan finished 5th at the 2004 Athens Olympics later in December Pakistan finished third at the 2004 Champions Trophy in Lahore, the third consecutive bronze medal. In 2005 Pakistan had a highlight when they defeated Olympic champion Australia to win the 2005 Hockey RaboTrophy in Netherlands. Pakistan finished 6th the 2006 World Cup and failed even to progress from the pool stages of the 2007 Asia Cup.\nBeijing Olympics and competitive decline (2008–2012).\nThe 2008 Beijing Olympics proved to be the worst performance of the team at the event where they finished 8th. The year 2010 started with another record worst performance at the 2010 World Cup in New Delhi where the team finished last at 12th place but later in the same year Pakistan had a major success by winning the gold medal at the 2010 Asian Games in China. In 2011 Pakistan played in many minor tournaments in lead up to the 2012 Olympics where they finished 7th. Later in the year 2012 Pakistan won bronze medal at the 2012 Champions Trophy in Melbourne after upsetting tournaments favorites like Germany. The Pakistani national team most successful tournament, in this period, was the Asian Hockey Champions Trophy winning the trophy first in 2012 against India and finishing as runners-up in the first edition of Asian Hockey Champions Trophy in 2011. During this period despite not any major team honor won the Pakistan team had world renowned individual players in world hockey in the likes of Sohail Abbas who remained top scorer at the 2002 World Cup and 2004 Olympics, he later broke the record of highest goalscorer in international hockey with a total of 348 goals and Rehan Butt who was twice voted as the Best Asian Player by Asian Hockey Federation, Shakeel Abbasi, Salman Akbar and Muhammad Saqlain.\nWorld Cup and Olympic absentee (2013–2020).\nPakistan, after having failed to get a direct entrance for the 2014 World Cup, were handed a last chance to qualify for the event by winning the 2013 Asia Cup, but they finished third and failed to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in their history. Pakistan failed to qualify for the Olympics for the first time at Rio 2016 after failing a qualification berth at the 2014–15 FIH Hockey World League. From 2016 to 2017, Pakistan performed poorly in different competitions even featuring a record 9–1 defeat against Australia in 2017. In 2018, Roelant Oltmans of Netherlands was brought in as coach and the team showed some improvement, but still performed poorly at the 2018 World Cup, failing to win a single match. Pakistan again failed to qualify for the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, losing the Olympic Qualifiers against Netherlands over a two-legged tie in 2019.\nContinued struggles and Olympic absentee (2021-present).\nPHF announced Pakistan's participation for the 2021 Asian Champions Trophy, the team's first appearance in an international competition after a gap of two years. A 20-man squad was announced with Siegfried Aikman as head coach prior to the tournament. Pakistan could not qualify for the 2023 World Cup despite it being a 16-team event. Pakistan then played 2022 Common wealth games where Pakistan performs poorly and finished 7th, In December 2022 Pakistan participated in 2022 Nations cup were Pakistan finished 7th, In July 2023 Shahnaz Sheikh was appointed as the head coach of team for 2023 Asian Champions Trophy, In August 2023 PHF announced 36-man squad for Asian Games 2023, In the Asian Games 2023 Pakistan lost to India by 10-2 which was the biggest defeat in their history, Pakistan finished 5th in the Asian Games 2023.Pakistan also failed to qualify for the 2024 Summer Olympics \nLogo and stadium.\nThe motif of the Pakistan national field hockey team has a star and crescent on a dark green field; with a vertical white stripe at the hoist, usually in green, white color, as represented in the flag of Pakistan.\nPakistan played at a number of different venues across the country, though by 1978, this had largely settled down to having National Hockey Stadium (also known as Gaddafi Hockey Stadium, named after former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi) in Lahore as the primary venue, with Faisalabad Hockey Stadium and the Hockey Club of Pakistan used on occasions where the National Hockey Stadium was unavailable for home matches. The stadium is considered to be the biggest international field hockey stadium in the world, and holds a capacity of 45,000 spectators.\nThe Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) has its headquarters at the stadium. Pakistan has hosted many international matches and competitions such as the Hockey Asia Cup of 1982 and Champions Trophy tournament in 1978, 1980, 1981, 1983, 1984, 1986, 1988, 1992, 1994, 1998, and 2004 along with the 1990 Hockey World Cup, where Pakistan lost 3–1 to the Netherlands in the final.\nHonors and recognition.\nSince its breakthrough in the 1948 Summer Olympics, Pakistan has won more than 20 official titles, which are detailed below:\nCompetitive record.\nTeam performance.\nTBD \"(to be determined)\", DNQ \"(did not qualify)\", DNP \"(did not participate)\"\nRecords.\n\"As of 27 October 2019\"\n\"Players in bold text are still active with Pakistan\"\nResults and fixtures.\n2021.\nAsian Hockey Champions Trophy\n2022.\n2022 Hockey Asia Cup\n2022 Commonwealth Games\n2022 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup\n2022 FIH Nations Cup\n2023.\n2023 Asian Champions trophy\n2023 Asian games\n2024.\n2024 Men's FIH Hockey Olympic Qualifiers"

        "title": "Charles Thompson (American football)",
        "text": "Charles Thompson (born May 28, 1968) is an American businessman, motivational speaker, and former football player, best known for his tenure and spectacular downfall as the quarterback of the Oklahoma Sooners.\nRise with the Sooners.\nRaised in Lawton, Oklahoma, Thompson proved to be a highly skilled athlete and was recruited by the University of Oklahoma, a NCAA Division I-A college football program, under head coach Barry Switzer. He was also drafted by Major League Baseball's Cincinnati Reds in the 4th round as a second baseman; however, he decided to focus on football. As a redshirt freshman, Thompson became the starting quarterback of the nationally ranked Sooners for the 1987 season. The highlight came on November 21, 1987, when Thompson led the offense of then #2-ranked Sooners to a dominating victory over the #1 Nebraska Cornhuskers in a game that was heavily hyped as the Game of the Century II. While the Sooners would drop their final game of the season in the 1988 Orange Bowl and finish 11-1, Thompson's status as a nationally famous collegiate athlete was confirmed.\nDuring the 1988 season, Thompson, now a redshirt sophomore, led the Sooners to a 9-3 record. Thompson was a successful quarterback, named to the All-Big Eight Conference - 1st team. Off the field he was a celebrity, volunteering to speak to at-risk youth about how to succeed in the face of adversity and, the danger of illegal drugs.\nDownfall.\nArrest.\nOn January 26, 1989, the FBI videotaped Thompson selling 17 grams of cocaine for $1,400 to an undercover agent. On February 13, Thompson was arrested in Norman, Oklahoma and charged with dealing cocaine. He was released to his mother's custody on February 15, to await trial as Thompson waived his right to a preliminary hearing. In the meantime, the Sooners suspended him from the team.\nAftermath.\nA media frenzy followed the arrest, peaking when a notorious picture of the handcuffed Thompson in a prison jumpsuit appeared on the cover of the February 27, 1989 issue of \"Sports Illustrated\", accompanied by accusations that the Switzer-led Sooners were out of control. Switzer's Sooners had already been under heavy public and media scrutiny before the incident as players had been arrested, in separate incidents, for assault with a deadly weapon and rape. With the national coverage brought by his star quarterback's arrest, Switzer resigned as head coach soon afterwards after leading the team for sixteen seasons.\nTrial and prison.\nAt his trial at a federal court in Oklahoma City, Thompson pleaded guilty, saying he knew he had done wrong and would take his punishment. The plea waived his rights to a jury trial and grand jury consideration of his case. He was convicted on April 26 of one count of conspiracy to distribute cocaine and sentenced on August 31 to two years in prison. He entered a federal prison in Big Spring, Texas on September 20, 1989.\nWhile in prison, Thompson spoke out on the pressure and vices that can befall big-time college football. He was interviewed for ESPN by Chris Fowler, and, with Allan Sonnenschein, wrote the 1990 book \"Down and Dirty: The Life and Crimes of Oklahoma Football\" ().\nAfter prison.\nReturn to football.\nAlthough his sentence carried a maximum term of 27 months and a minimum term of 21, he was released after 17 months and transferred to Central State University, a historically black university located in Wilberforce, Ohio. He joined Central State's then-NAIA football team primarily as a running back, and helped them win the 1992 NAIA Division I Championship. As a 25-year-old junior, Thompson carried 200 times for 1,018 yards and five touchdowns and caught 29 passes for 439 yards and 7 touchdowns. He decided to forgo his senior year and enter the 1993 NFL Draft; but his past proved to be too great a risk for NFL teams, and he went undrafted and never played in the NFL.\nPost-football.\nWith his football career over, Thompson completed his degree, reaffirmed his Christianity and married. He found success as a motivational speaker, and his turnaround was featured in a \"Sports Illustrated\" \"Where are they now?\" feature. His oldest son Kendal Thompson also played quarterback at University of Oklahoma before transferring to the University of Utah. He was instrumental in Utah's win over #8 UCLA on October 4, 2014. In July 2016, Kendal signed a three-year contract as a wide receiver for the Washington Redskins. His middle son, Casey Thompson, played at the University of Texas from 2017 to 2021. After dealing with a hand injury between various starts during the 2021 season, he announced he would transfer to the University of Nebraska-Lincoln. On May 10, 2023 he transferred to FAU (2023–present). His youngest son is Cade Thompson. Charles currently resides in Oklahoma City."

He started all four years at Vandy and led the Commodores to their best seasons in terms of wins since 1960. One of his victories was a 14–10 upset over the #13 Alabama Crimson Tide in 1969. It was Vanderbilt's first victory over Alabama in 13 seasons.\nCoaching career.\nAfter graduating from Vanderbilt, Brown spent the 1973 season as a graduate assistant at his alma mater. From there, he went to East Carolina University, where he spent two seasons as an assistant to Pat Dye, coaching quarterbacks and wide receivers. In 1976 and 1977, he served as the offensive coordinator at Jacksonville State University. The Gamecocks played for the NCAA Division II Football Championship in 1977.\nBrown spent the 1978 season as an assistant at Texas Tech University under Rex Dockery before landing his first head coaching position a year later.

Nine clubs play in the competition, eight clubs are from Brisbane, and one club is from Gold Coast.The premiership has been contested in its present form since 1929.\nHistory.\nQueensland Premier Rugby (QPR) evolved out of the Brisbane club competition that had been running since 1887. It was created by players, administrators, referees and coaches to expand and improve the top level of Queensland non-professional rugby. QPR provides Queensland rugby players a stepping stone for selection into the Queensland Reds and other teams in Super Rugby or other professional rugby competitions.\nPrevious to 1920, the Hospitals Challenge Cup was established as a fund-raising exercise for the Brisbane General Hospital. After the devastation of World War I the competition was suspended until the Hospitals Cup was established. The Brisbane Club competition recommenced in 1929.\nThe 1975 Grand Final was played between the Brothers club and GPS and Brothers won the match. Teachers-Norths, Wests and again Brothers won the next seasons. In 1979, the first ever draw in a final occurred with a 24-all draw between rivals University and Brothers, a reply of the final was held, which saw University defeat Brothers by a mere 3 points. Brothers dominated the next few seasons, winning the 1980 to 1984 premierships. Souths won their first title in 1986, and University won a number of titles at the end of the decade.\nSouths came to major prominence during the 1990s, winning the competition five times in a row from 1991 through to 1995, and then again in 1998 and 2000. They also featured in the 1996 season final which GPS won, and the 1997 final which Easts won. Canberra also competed in the competition, and found major success, winning three titles in a row from 2001 to 2003. The Gold Coast Breakers also began to become a force in the competition, featuring in five finals from 2001 to 2007, although they were on the receiving end of the competitions largest ever grand final score being thrashed 85-19 by the Sunnybank Dragons in the 2007 Grand Final.\nIn future, teams from other Rugby regions in Queensland may also join the competition, thus encouraging the pursuit of Rugby excellence across the state, not just confining it Queensland's south-east corner. However at a meeting of the Sunshine Coast Rugby Union in October 2013, it was decided by the members not to compete in the 2014 QRU’s Premier Rugby Competition, but will instead focus its energy on becoming the leading force in regional rugby.\nOther trophies.\nThomas Welsby Memorial Cup: The top two first grade teams at the end of the first full round of home and away matches contest the Welsby Cup in their second round meeting. The cup was originally donated by Thomas Welsby.\nKeith Horsley Memorial Trophy: Now presented to First Grade Minor Premiers, since 1978.

Within the state of Victoria, it is the governing body for the sport of rugby union.\nRugby Victoria manages competitions for males and females in several age groups and divisions, and involving clubs from metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria. \nRugby union was founded in Melbourne in 1888. However competition lapsed and was twice re-established during the first twenty years, and again after the first World War when the present governing body was founded in 1926, then known as the Victorian Rugby Union, or VRU.\nIn December 2017, the VRU was re-branded as Rugby Victoria.\nHistory.\nEarly years: 1888 to 1945.\nThe Melbourne Rugby Union was established in 1888 and the first two clubs were founded in that year. Later that season, a Victorian team was selected to play the British side known then as the \"English Footballers\" but now recognised as the First British Lions team.\nThe visitors won the match, 9-3. Melbourne's club competition ceased in 1890 but a new administrative body, the Victorian Rugby Union, was formed in 1893. The Victorians played their first inter-colonial rugby match in 1894, beating South Wales by 3-0 at the East Melbourne Cricket Ground.\nCompetition lapsed again after the Victorians were defeated 30-0 at the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG) by the British Lions in 1899, but the Victorian Rugby Union was re-formed in 1908. Australia played Victoria at the MCG in August of that year, on their way to Great Britain for what became known as the First Wallabies Tour.\nOf the seven clubs comprising the new Union in 1909, Melbourne, East Melbourne, South Melbourne and University were the first to compete for the Dewar Shield, a trophy which is still awarded today to the premier first grade team. Competition ceased during the First World War and recommenced under a re-established VRU in 1926.\nThe subsequent decade later became known as the Golden Years of Victorian Rugby and included the selection of the first Victorian-born player to represent Australia, Sir Edward \"Weary\" Dunlop, in 1932. Dave Cowper, who played for the Melbourne Rugby Club and represented Victoria in the 1930s became Victoria's first, and so far only, Wallaby captain in 1933.\nIn 1939, four Victorian players were selected in the Wallaby side to tour Europe: Andy Barr, Max Carpenter, Stan Bisset and George Pearson. \nHowever the tour was prematurely ended by Britain's declaration of war on Germany just two days after the team arrived at Plymouth on 2 September 1939, with all sport in Britain cancelled.\nAmateur rugby: 1945 to 1995.\nIn 1958, the first test match in Victoria was staged at Olympic Park Stadium, with Australia hosting the Maoris.\nModern era: 1996 onward.\nThe Victorian Rugby Union (VRU) bid unsuccessfully for the fourth Australian Super 14 licence, which eventually went to the Western Force prior to the 2006 season. However, New South Wales gave up a fourth franchise for the Australian Rugby Championship, allowing Victoria to field the Melbourne Rebels in that competition.\nIn November 2009, SANZAR announced that Australia had won the 15th Super rugby franchise licence, and the Australian Rugby Union awarded it to the Melbourne Rebels consortium led by media magnate Harold Mitchell. The VRU did not initially own or run the Melbourne Rebels.\nOn 27 June 2013, the Rebels announced that foundation shareholders Harold Mitchell AC, Bob Dalziel, Lyndsey Cattermole, Alan Winney, Ralph D'Silva, Gary Gray, Paul Kirk, Leon L'Huillier, David Ogilvy and Michael Bartlett had transferred 100% of their shares to the Victorian Rugby Union. The two organizations combined operations as a result of the transfer with Ross Oakley concluding his tenure as CEO of the VRU once the transfer was made. Rebels CEO Rob Clarke took responsibility for both organizations. Jonathan Ling became the chairman of the Melbourne Rebels, replacing Harold Mitchell. Peter Leahy was appointed General Manager of Community Rugby to oversee the operations of local competitions and all Victorian Community Rugby activities.\nCurrent competition.\nVictoria has twenty-six rugby clubs . Senior player numbers have grown from 1,400 in 1998 to well over 2,200 in 2012. Teams in the competition have grown from 4 in 1909 to 173 in 2013.\nThe eight teams that play for the Shield in the domestic Premier 1 Division are:\n, Rugby Victoria has seven teams in their senior women's competition.\nRepresentative teams.\nThe Victoria Country Barbarians team competed in the NRC Division 2 tournament from 2018 to 2019.

In 1992 the first National Women's Tournament was held in Newcastle, NSW. The following year the Australian Women's Rugby Union was established, and it was declared that the national women's team would be called the Wallaroos. It was chosen because it was the name of one of Australia's oldest clubs, the Wallaroo Football Club, which was formed in 1870.\nHistory.\nThe Wallaroos played their first international in 1994 against New Zealand, also known as the Black Ferns. The match was played at North Sydney Oval, and New Zealand won the game 37 to 0. The team placed fifth at their first World Cup appearance in 1998 in the Netherlands.

It became the Australian Capital Territory Rugby Union (ACTRU) in 1939, and eventually the ACT and Southern NSW Rugby Union. It received its current name prior to the 2005 Super 12 season, when the Far South Coast and Southern Inland unions of New South Wales joined the ACT and Monaro Rugby Unions.

The team finished fourth at the 2017 Rugby World Cup in Ireland.\nIn May 2018, Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach. Cain joined the Eagles after winning the inaugural Tyrell Premier 15s title in England with Saracens Women.\nHistory.\n\"(Source: US Women's Rugby Foundation)\"\nThe history of women's rugby in the United States can be traced back to three teams that existed in 1972 – the Colorado State University Hookers at Fort Collins; the University of Colorado, at Boulder; and the University of Illinois, at Champaign. During the mid-1970s women's teams began to spring up on college campuses across the United States. As those players graduated they went on to set up teams near cities and urban centers. At that time there was only one division for all women's rugby. In 1975 United States Rugby Football Union was formed and contained four territories. At this time the women had their own Board of Directors and followed in parallel USARFU with four territories (East, Midwest, West and Pacific). In 1978 the first Women's National Championships was held. The Chicago Women's Rugby Club in Chicago, Illinois hosted this event. The winner of that championship was Portland, Maine.\n1980s–1997.\nIn 1985 the first semblance of a national team was formed. An ‘invitation-only’ team was put together and made up of, arguably, the top women playing the game at the time. The team was named WIVERN and toured throughout England and France. The team finished the tour undefeated. Many of these players went on to be selected to the 1991 World Cup Team.\nIn 1987 the USA women's national team was officially born with their first match against the Canadian women's national team. Although the women were not permitted to wear the Eagle logo, this match was sanctioned by Rugby Canada and USA Rugby. USA and Canada began holding an annual match, which became known as the CanAm series. For ten years the Women Eagles went undefeated in this test series.\nIn 1990 the women's national team, competing under the name ‘USA Presidents 15’, traveled to New Zealand to compete in the historic Women's World Rugby Festival. The WNT posted a record of 3–1 with their only loss coming at the hands of New Zealand. In 1991 the first Women's Rugby World Cup was held in Cardiff, Wales. Coached by Beantown's Kevin O’Brien, a Welshman himself, and Minnesota's Chris Leach, a South African the stage was set for the US women to bring home the Cup. Defeating New Zealand in semi-final play, the USA women advanced to the finals where they defeated England. Also in 1991 the first woman was elected to serve on the USARFU Board of Directors. Jamie Jordan was elected Treasurer for the Board.\nIn 1997 The U23 women's national team was formed. USA Women's National Team Head Coach Franck Boivert appointed Penn State Coach Peter Steinberg to be Head Coach for the U23 Women's National Team program. At an event in the CanAm Series the US Women's National Team celebrated their 10-year anniversary by cheering on the Women's U23 National Team in their first test against Canada.\nPresent.\nThe USA Women's National Team XVs finished fourth at Rugby World Cup 2017 in Ireland which earned them automatic qualification to the next World Cup in New Zealand in 2021. In early 2018, the program hired former Women's National Team player Emilie Bydwell to serve as its General Manager of Women's High Performance. Soon after in May, Rob Cain was appointed full-time Head Coach and has since helped lead the program in a new direction.\nThe Women's National Team Program fields a number of age-grade and development programs including the High School All-Americans (U18), Under-20s, Collegiate All-Americans and USA Selects.

        "text": "The Russian Rugby Championship, officially known as the Pari - Russian Rugby Championship for sponsorship reasons (), is Russia's top level professional men's rugby union competition. The Russian Rugby Championship is run by Russian Rugby Union and is contested by 10 teams as of the 2019-2020 season.\nHistory.\nThe founding of the league coincided with a period of rapid change for Russian rugby. The first Russian rugby championship, which succeeded the Soviet Rugby Championship, was played in 1992, under the name Russian Superleague. The league kept this name until 2004, when the competition was then rebranded as the Rugby Premier League.\nIn 2007, Yug-Krasnodar were admitted to the competition, increasing the number of teams in the league to eight.\nJust one year later, in 2008, a further six teams from several of the lower division competitions were admitted into the Rugby Premier League. This increased the total number of teams again, to fourteen teams. The fourteen teams were split into three conferences, based on geography, in that season. One thing to note was that many of the elevated clubs geographically were semi-professional or even amateur in nature, which lead to a lack of competitive balance.\n2010 saw another change of format to the Rugby Premier League where the East-West divide was removed, culminating in the formation of a 'Super Group'. This meant that VVA-Podmoskovye Monino, Krasny Yar, Enisey-STM, Slava Moscow, RC Novokuznetsk and Imperia-Dynamo as well as Fili Moscow and Spartak GM were scheduled to play each other in a straight home-and-away league format."

        "title": "Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball",
        "text": "The Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball program represents Georgetown University in NCAA Division I men's intercollegiate basketball and the Big East Conference. Georgetown has competed in men's college basketball since 1907. The current head coach of the program is Ed Cooley.\nGeorgetown won the national championship in 1984 and has made the Final Four on five occasions. They have won the Big East Conference tournament a record eight times, and have also won or shared the Big East regular season title ten times. They have appeared in the NCAA tournament 31 times and in the National Invitation Tournament 13 times.\nThe Hoyas historically have been well regarded not only for their team success, but also for generating players that have succeeded both on and off the court, producing NBA legends such as Patrick Ewing, Dikembe Mutombo, Alonzo Mourning, and Allen Iverson, as well as United States Congressman Henry Hyde and former NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue. A total of 7 former Hoya players or coaches are members of the Basketball Hall of Fame.\nHistory.\nEarly years (1907–1943).\nFounded in the fall of 1906, the Georgetown men's basketball team played its first game on February 9, 1907, defeating the University of Virginia by a score of 22–11. In its first 60-some years, the program displayed only sporadic success. Until McDonough Gymnasium opened on campus for the 1950–51 season, the team changed home courts frequently, playing on campus at Ryan Gymnasium and off campus at McKinley Technology High School, Uline Arena, and the National Guard Armory, as well as playing individual home games at the University of Maryland's Ritchie Coliseum and The Catholic University of America's Brookland Gymnasium, among others. The downtown locations of these venues was also influenced by the number of Law School students who played on the team in this era. From 1918 through 1923, while on campus at Ryan Gymnasium, Georgetown managed a 52–0 home record under coach John O'Reilly. A large on-campus arena was proposed in 1927, but it was shelved during the Great Depression.\nThe team recruited its first All-American, Ed Hargaden, in 1931. From 1932 until 1939, the Hoyas played in the Eastern Intercollegiate Conference, and they were regular-season conference co-champions in 1939. In 1942, a Hoya went pro for the first time, when three seniors, Al Lujack, Buddy O'Grady, and Dino Martin, were drafted professionally upon graduation.\nThe next year the team, led by future congressman Henry Hyde, reached new heights and posted its first 20-win season ever, going 22–5 on the year. This success translated into a berth into the 1943 NCAA tournament, the school's first postseason appearance. Taking advantage of the opportunity, the Hoyas made it all the way to the National Championship game, where they ultimately lost to Wyoming. Georgetown's coach of this squad, Elmer Ripley, was later inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1973.\nWorld War II and the lean years (1943–1972).\nComing off of the best season in school history, momentum was stalled as the program was suspended from 1943 to 1945 because of World War II. Following the hiatus the program struggled to find its footing, and it was rarely successful over the next three decades, only making two postseason appearances during this time period.\nIn 1953, former Baltimore Bullets player Buddy Jeannette coached the team to its first National Invitation Tournament invitation, but the team lost in the first round to Louisville. Top players from this period include Tom O'Keefe, the first Hoya to reach 1,000 career points in 1949–50, and future National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, who graduated second in Hoya career rebounds in 1962. O'Keefe returned to coach the team from 1960 until 1966. In 1966 the school hired John \"Jack\" Magee, who had led Boston College as a player to its first NCAA Tournament bid. Magee had some relative success early on, having several winning seasons behind Guard Jim Barry and Forward Richard Manewal that were capped off with an invite to the 1970 NIT, just its third post-season appearance ever. However, the team lost to LSU in the first round. A losing season the subsequent year, followed up with a three-win season in 1971–72, the worst in school history, ultimately led to his dismissal. This was the last time a Hoyas head coach suffered back-to-back losing seasons for over 35 years.\nJohn Thompson era (1972–1999).\nJohn Thompson Jr., played two seasons with the Boston Celtics before he achieved local notability coaching St. Anthony's High School in Washington, D.C., to several very successful seasons. Thompson was hired to coach Georgetown in 1972, and with recruits from St. Anthony's like Merlin Wilson, quickly and dramatically improved the team. Georgetown, while still independent, participated in the Eastern College Athletic Conference′s 1975 postseason ECAC South tournament, and after a 16–9 regular season found itself facing West Virginia in the conference tournament championship. Derrick Jackson's buzzer beater won Georgetown its first tournament championship, and a bid to the 1975 NCAA tournament. Georgetown repeated as ECAC South tournament champions the following year, beating George Washington University when Craig Esherick's buzzer beater sent the game to overtime, and as ECAC South-Upstate Tournament champions in the 1978-79 season, beating Syracuse University in Jim Boeheim's first game against the Hoyas as Syracuse's coach.\nPrior to the 1979–80 season, Georgetown joined with six other schools, Providence, St. John's, Syracuse, Seton Hall, Connecticut, and Boston College to found a conference focused primarily on basketball. The Big East Conference provided Georgetown increased competition, and several of its longest rivalries. On February 13, 1980, in the final game at Manley Field House, Georgetown star Sleepy Floyd scored two last-second free-throws to snap No. 3 Syracuse's 57 game home winning streak, leading Coach Thompson to declare \"Manley Field House is officially closed.\" They faced Syracuse again three weeks later in the first Big East tournament finals, winning 87–81. In the 1980 NCAA tournament, the team advanced to the Elite Eight, where they fell to the Iowa Hawkeyes on a last second foul call.\nThe team moved its home arena in the 1981-82 season to the Capital Centre in Landover, Maryland, to accommodate its growing fan base. It also marked the arrival of heralded recruit, Patrick Ewing, who became one of the first college players to start and star on a varsity team as a freshman. That year, Ewing led the Hoyas to their second Big East tournament title in school history, and a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament. In the tournament, the Hoyas advanced to their first Final Four since 1943, where they defeated the University of Louisville 50–46, to set up a showdown in the NCAA Final against the University of North Carolina. In one of the most star-studded championship games in NCAA history, Ewing was called for goaltending five times in the first half (later revealed to be intentional at the behest of coach Thompson), setting the tone for the Hoyas and making his presence felt. The Hoyas led by one point late in the game, but a jumpshot by future NBA superstar Michael Jordan gave North Carolina the lead. Georgetown still had a chance at winning the game in the final seconds, but Freddy Brown mistakenly threw a bad pass directly to opposing player James Worthy, and North Carolina won 63–62.\nFor the 1982-83 season, Georgetown began the season as the No. 2 ranked team in the country. The early season included a highly anticipated matchup with No. 1 Virginia, and highly regarded center Ralph Sampson. Arenas nationwide jockeyed to host the matchup but Georgetown insisted on hosting it at the Capital Centre. WTBS won the rights to broadcast the game with a $550,000 bid, and it was billed as the \"Game of the Decade\". It became the first major college sports event telecasted exclusively on cable television. In the game, held on December 11, 1982, Virginias veteran team won, 68–63. The Hoyas went on to post a 22–10 record for the season and made another NCAA Tournament appearance, but were defeated in the second round of the tournament by Memphis State. This was the only season in Ewing's four-year Georgetown career where the team did not make it as least as far as the National Championship game.\nIn the 1983-84 season Georgetown again won the Big East conference regular season title, and faced Syracuse for the Big East tournament championship. In a physical and tightly contested contest, Georgetown won 82–71 in overtime, securing their third tournament title in the first five years of the newly formed conference. In the NCAA tournament, the No. 1 seeded Hoyas ultimately advanced to the Final Four for the third time in school history to face Kentucky, a team which had never lost a national semifinal game and was led by the \"Twin Towers,\" Sam Bowie and Melvin Turpin. Georgetown was able to turn an early 12 point deficit into a 53–40 win to advance to the National Championship game. In the final, the Hoyas faced the University of Houston and future Hall of Fame center Hakeem Olajuwon, who were making their second straight National Championship game appearance. Georgetown led comfortably throughout the final, and went on to an 84–75 victory, giving the school its first NCAA Championship in school history. Ewing was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, while Thompson became the first African American coach to win an NCAA Division I title. Freddy Brown, who made the key turnover in the title game two years prior, was given the chance to raise the trophy first.\nTo begin the 1984-85 season, the defending champions opened the season as the No. 1 ranked team and won their first 18 games. On January 26, 1985, the St. John's University Redmen snapped the Hoyas' 29 game win streak (dating back to the prior season), in what was the first of an unprecedented four contests this season. Their next meeting on February 27, 1985, was one of the most anticipated games in college basketball history, with Georgetown and St. John's ranked No. 2 and No. 1 respectively. Coach Thompson entered Madison Square Garden wearing a shirt under his blazer in the same sweater pattern as St. John's coach Lou Carnesecca, and as a result the game became known as \"the sweater game.\" The Hoyas easily won the game 85–69, and then defeated the Redmen again just a few weeks later in the 1985 Big East tournament finals, capturing their fourth title in six years. The teams met one more time, after both advanced to the Final Four in the NCAA tournament. Again No. 1 Georgetown was victorious, easily handling St. John's 77–59. In the title game the Hoyas found themselves matched up with another conference rival in Villanova, whom they had beaten twice that season. An overwhelming favorite going into the game, Georgetown was upset by the Wildcats 66–64, who shot a record 78.6 percent (22 of 28) from the floor, denying Georgetown back-to-back titles. Ewing graduated, having helped his team to a 121–23 record in his four years, and was the first player in school history to be drafted with the first overall pick.\nFollowing the enormous heights of Ewing's four-year run, the program continued its success in the years that followed. Senior Reggie Williams led the Hoyas to both Big East regular season and tournament championships in the 1986–87 season. Freshman Alonzo Mourning and sophomore Dikembe Mutombo helped win both titles in the 1988–89 season. Mourning and Mutombo were both excellent shot blockers; Mourning led the nation in 1988–89, and fans created a \"Rejection Row\" section under the basket. They repeated both championships in the 1989–90 season and won the regular season title in the 1991-92 season.\nIn the 1994–95 season, newcomer Allen Iverson won the Big East Rookie of the Year award. During his two years at Georgetown, Iverson scored a Georgetown-record 22.9 points per game. In 1995–96, he propelled the Hoyas to a major upset over the Connecticut Huskies during the season, but Georgetown later lost to the Huskies in the final seconds of that year's Big East tournament. In the NCAA tournament, the Hoyas came up one game short of the Final Four, losing to the University of Massachusetts, the top ranked team in the country.\nIn the 1996–97 season, with an 11–7 conference record, the Hoyas won the regular season Big East 7 Division title for the second year in a row, but fell in the first round of the 1997 NCAA tournament. In December 1997, just after the beginning of the 1997-98 season, the team moved back into Washington, D.C., with the construction of a new arena, the Verizon Center (originally MCI Center), in Chinatown. The 1997-98 campaign ended in an overtime loss to Georgia Tech in the NIT.\nThompson retired abruptly in the midst of the 1998–99 season on January 8, 1999, citing marriage problems, and was replaced by his assistant Craig Esherick. Under Thompson, 26 players were chosen in the NBA draft, eight in the first round, including two players selected first overall; Ewing by the New York Knicks in 1985 and Iverson by the Philadelphia 76ers in 1996. Over his seasons, Thompson's Hoyas went an impressive 596–239 (.714), running off a streak of 24 postseason appearances with 20 in the NCAA tournament and four in the NIT. He was honored as the National Coach of the Year three times during his career at Georgetown, and was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 1999.\nCraig Esherick era (1999–2004).\nCraig Esherick coached the Georgetown Hoyas basketball squad from January 1999 to March 2004. Esherick was a four-year player for the men's basketball team from 1974 to 1978 and then the lead assistant coach under John Thompson Jr. from 1981 to 1999. The team finished with a 15–15 record in his first season – going 8–10 after Thompson resigned and Esherick took over –before losing to Princeton in the first round of the 1999 NIT. They improved in 1999-2000, going 19–15 and accepting an invitation to the 2000 NIT. After winning the first-round game in triple overtime over Virginia, the Hoyas lost in the second-round game to California.\nIn 2000–01, led by future top NBA Draft pick Michael Sweetney, they made the NCAA tournament after finishing 23–7 in the regular season. In the opening round of the NCAA tournament the 7th-seeded Hoyas advanced past 10th-seeded Arkansas on a game-winning shot at the buzzer by Nat Burton. The Hoyas subsequently beat Hampton, and then lost to third-seeded Maryland in the Sweet Sixteen.\nIn 2001–02, the Hoyas went 19–11, barely missing an NCAA tournament bid. The team rejected a bid to the 2002 NIT bid because of travel-arrangement issues associated with the players' ability to attend classes, resulting in their first season without a postseason tournament since 1973-74. In 2002-03, the Hoyas finished the regular season with a 19–15 record, and accepted a bid to the 2003 NIT, where they made it to the final but lost to Big East rival St. John's. Sweetney was named a second-team All-American and was drafted with the ninth pick in the 2002 NBA draft by the New York Knicks.\nIn Esherick's final season, 2003–04, the Hoyas struggled to a 13–15 overall record and a dismal 4–12 Big East record, and for the first time since the 1973–74 season received no invitation to either the NCAA tournament or the NIT. The 13 wins were the team's fewest since the 1973–74 season and Esherick was fired after seasons as head coach on March 15, 2004, five days after an opening-round loss in the Big East tournament to Boston College. He had posted a 103–74 (.597) record during his tenure as head coach. Georgetown began a national search for a new coach after Esherick's firing that resulted in the hiring of John Thompson III.\nJohn Thompson era (2004–2017).\nOn April 21, 2004, John Thompson III was selected as the head coach of the Hoyas. The son of the legendary Hoyas coach took over the position after over a decade at Princeton University. The younger Thompson was a player for the Tigers from 1984 to 1988, was an assistant coach at Princeton from 1995 to 2000, and then took over as head coach at Princeton until his move to the Hoyas. Thompson's head coaching stint at Princeton was marked with success as he led the Tigers to three Ivy League titles, two NCAA Tournament appearances and one NIT appearance.\nThompson brought with him an adaptation of the Princeton offense as an offensive philosophy to Georgetown. He had learned it under the tutelage of legendary coach Pete Carril at Princeton and began to adjust the strategy to the more athletic players he would be coaching at Georgetown. Thompson III also immediately brought two new assistant coaches to Georgetown in Robert Burke and Kevin Broadus.\nThompson inherited three players that Esherick had recruited: Jeff Green, Roy Hibbert, Tyler Crawford and RaMell Ross. He also brought with him a former Princeton recruit, Jonathan Wallace and saw the return of two major contributors from the previous Georgetown team in Brandon Bowman, Ashanti Cook, and Darrel Owens. John Thompson III's first notable win with the team took place on January 21, 2006, in the 16th game of the 2005–06 season, when unranked Georgetown upset No. 1 Duke. This was Georgetown's first win over a No. 1 ranked team in 21 years.\nThe 2006–07 season marked the centennial of Hoya hoops, which was celebrated by honoring some of the team's most famous alumni at the Georgetown-Marquette game on February 10, 2007. Led by juniors Green, Hibbert, Wallace, Patrick Ewing Jr., the son of the Georgetown player from the elder Thompson era, the Hoyas won their first regular-season Big East Championship since 1992 and defeated Pittsburgh to win their first Big East tournament championship since 1989. Jeff Green was named the Big East Player of the Year and the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. In the NCAA tournament, the Hoyas beat North Carolina in the Regional Final when their defense caused North Carolina to suffer an improbable collapse in which UNC missed 22 of their final 23 field goal attempts. The Hoyas then advanced to the Final Four where they fell to an Ohio State team led by Greg Oden.\nThe 2007–08 Hoyas finished with a regular season record of 27–5, and again won the conference regular season title. They lost to Pittsburgh in the Big East tournament championship game. They received a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they lost their second-round game. After the season, Roy Hibbert, Jonathan Wallace, and Patrick Ewing Jr. all graduated, while Vernon Macklin and Jeremiah Rivers both transferred from the school.\nThe Hoyas began their 2008–09 season ranked No. 22 AP/No. 18 Coaches, however, college basketball's toughest strength of schedule eventually wore down a team that was also one of the youngest. The Hoyas were 7–11 in Big East play for a 12th-place finish, followed by a first-round loss in the Big East tournament. The Hoyas accepted a bid to the NIT, but lost in the first round to Baylor.\nIn 2009–10, the team finished the season 23–11, and 10–8 in Big East play. They advanced to the championship game of the Big East tournament before losing to West Virginia. They received an at–large bid to the NCAA tournament, earning a No. 3 seed in the Midwest Region, where they were upset by No. 14 seed Ohio in the first round. Greg Monroe entered the NBA draft as a sophomore and was selected by the Detroit Pistons.\nThe 2010–11 team was led by Austin Freeman and Chris Wright. The team scored multiple early wins over ranked teams, including an overtime win at No. 9 Missouri, but their stumbles at the end of the season coincided with Wright breaking his hand and missing three games. The team received an at-large bid as a No. 6 seed, but lost in their first game of the NCAA tournament to No. 11-seeded and eventual Final Four participant VCU.\nPrior to the 2011–12 season, the Hoyas made a goodwill trip to China for several matches with local teams. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden attended their first game, a win over the Shanxi Zhongyu Brave Dragons. Their second game against the Bayi Rockets, however, ended in a brawl, causing the team to leave the court while Chinese fans threw garbage and debris. Georgetown won its final games, against the Liaoning Dinosaurs and the Taiwanese national team without incident. The Hoyas finished the season in fourth place in the Big East and received a bid to the NCAA tournament as a No. 3 seed in the Midwest. After a win in the second round, they were upset by No. 11-seeded NC State.\nThe 2012–13 season saw the Hoyas as the top overall seed in the Big East tournament based on a tiebreaker, but lost in the semifinals. Georgetown received a bid as a No. 2 seed in the South bracket in the NCAA tournament, facing tournament newcomer Florida Gulf Coast University in the second round. Georgetown lost to the 15th-seeded Eagles 78–68, the seventh number two seed to lose to a 15 seed. It was the fourth consecutive season the Hoyas were eliminated by a double-digit seed in the NCAA tournament.\nThe 2013–14 season was the team's first after Georgetown and six other schools left the original Big East Conference and joined Butler, Creighton, and Xavier in forming the new Big East Conference – part of a major conference realignment in which several other teams moved to the Atlantic Coast Conference from the old Big East and the old Big East became the American Athletic Conference. Like the previous year, the 2013–14 season started abroad, with the Hoyas playing in the Armed Forces Classic at Camp Humphreys near Pyeongtaek, South Korea. After a 17–13 regular-season record followed by an upset in the first round of the Big East tournament at the hands of last-place DePaul, the team received a No. 4 seed in the NIT, losing in the second round to top-seeded Florida State.\nIn 2014–15, the Hoyas rebounded from their previous season's performance. Ranked as high as No. 21 at times, they completed the regular season with a 20–7 record and a second-place finish in the Big East, and advanced to the semifinals of the Big East tournament before losing to Xavier. Ranked No. 22 in the country, they received a No. 4 seed in the NCAA tournament, but lost to Utah in the third round.\nThe Hoyas under Thompson III struggled for the next two years. They began their 2015–16 season with a four-game exhibition trip to Italy and Switzerland, and early in the regular season defeated No. 14 Syracuse, but then staggered to a 15–18 finish. They failed to receive an invitation to either the NCAA tournament or the NIT for the first time since 2004 and only the second time since 1974.\nDuring the 2016–17 season, Georgetown defeated three ranked teams—No. 13 Oregon, No. 16 Creighton, and No. 11 Butler—as well as their former Big East rivals Syracuse and Connecticut, but they finished ninth in the Big East with a 5–13 conference record—the most losses they had ever suffered in a season in either version of the Big East Conference—and lost to St. John's in the first round of the 2017 Big East tournament to finish 14–18. They missed both the NCAA tournament and the NIT for the second straight year, the first time they had missed the postseason in back-to-back seasons since 1974, and Thompson became the first Georgetown head coach to preside over consecutive losing seasons since John \"Jack\" Magee in 1970-71 and 1971-72. On March 23, 2017, Georgetown officials announced that Thompson had been fired.\nPatrick Ewing era (2017–2023).\nOn April 3, 2017, Georgetown University announced that it had hired Patrick Ewing, the school's most decorated player, as its head coach. In his four years as a player at Georgetown, Ewing led the Hoyas to three Big East championships, three Final Fours, and the 1984 National Championship. Prior to taking over as the program's head coach, Ewing had spent the previous thirteen years as an assistant coach in the NBA, working for four different franchises under the tutelage of coaches such as Jeff Van Gundy, Stan Van Gundy, and Steve Clifford.\nIn 2017–18, Georgetown finished with a 15–15 record and 5–13 in the Big East. The Hoyas won the first eight games of Ewing's tenure, and finished their non-conference schedule with a 10–1 record, but struggled in conference play. The season ended with a 77–88 loss to St. John's in the first round of the Big East tournament. The team did not participate in any postseason tournament.\nIn Ewing's second season, the 2018–19 team finished 19–12 and 9–9 in the Big East, in a four-way tie for third place in the conference, their highest finish since 2015. At the conclusion of the conference schedule, Jesse Govan was named First Team All-Big East, James Akinjo was named Big East Freshman of the Year, and Mac McClung and Josh LeBlanc were named to the All-Big East Freshman Team. The Hoyas lost their first game in the 2019 Big East tournament to Seton Hall 57–73. They were selected to play in the 2019 NIT, their first postseason appearance since 2015, but dropped their first-round game 68–71 to Harvard.\nThe following season the 2019–20 Hoyas finished 15–17 and 5–13 in the Big East. In November, the team participated in the Empire Classic at Madison Square Garden in New York City where they beat No. 22 Texas 82–66, and moved to the final to face No. 1 Duke. Despite having a double digit lead in the first half vs Duke, the Hoyas ultimately fell 73–81. Playing with only 9 scholarship players following several defections and injuries, the Hoyas lost their final 7 games, including a 62–75 loss in the opening round of the 2020 Big East tournament to St. John's. All postseason tournaments were subsequently cancelled due to COVID-19.\nThe 2020–21 Hoyas finished the season 10–13 and 7–9 in the Big East. Before the season started, leading scorer Mac McClung announced his decision to transfer to Texas Tech. Because of COVID-19 protocols, the team played all of its home games on campus at McDonough Arena without fans. After a 69–74 loss at Syracuse, the team went on a 21-day pause due to COVID-19 protocols. After the hiatus, the team returned to win six of its next ten games. The Hoyas 7–9 record led to an 8th-place finish in the conference. At the 2021 Big East tournament, the team won its first tournament game under Ewing, with a 68–49 victory over Marquette in the opening round, then followed that up with wins against top-seeded Villanova and Seton Hall, sending them to the title game where they defeated Creighton 73–48 for their first title since 2007, and the eighth in school history, extending their own conference record. The Hoyas earned a 12 seed in the NCAA tournament, where they lost their opening round game to Colorado 73–96.\nThe following season, the 2021–22 Hoyas were unable to build off their unlikely March run the prior season, and they suffered their worst season in school history. Georgetown lost all 19 conference games they played that season. They also set a school record for most losses in a season with 25, finishing the year at 6–25. The season ended with a 53–57 loss in the 2022 Big East tournament to Seton Hall. Despite some rumblings about his job security, Ewing was retained by the university for the following season.\nDespite some optimism with several high impact transfers brought in over the off-season, the 2022–23 Hoyas failed to improve off the prior year's low. The team would lose its first 9 conference games, extending the record of consecutive conference game losses to 29, until they eventually beat DePaul 81–76 on January 24, at Capital One Arena. The Hoyas would only win more game after this point and finished the year at 7–25, matching the program's high water mark for losses, just set the previous season. The team lost in the 2023 Big East tournament 48–80 to Villanova. The following day, the university announced that Ewing would not return as coach, ending his six year run at his alma mater. His Georgetown coaching career ended with a record of 75–109 (.408) and 28–81 (.257) in the Big East; both are the lowest winning percentages for a coach in the modern era of the program.\nEd Cooley era (2023–present).\nOn March 20, 2023, Ed Cooley accepted an offer to become the new head coach of the Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team after 12 years in the same role at conference rival Providence College. The decision to hire Cooley was praised as a move likely to strengthen the program. In his second game, Cooley’s team lost to the Holy Cross Crusaders who were ranked in the bottom ten percent of all teams in Division 1. Many criticized Cooley’s inbound play in the final seconds as uninspired.\nAwards and honors.\nNaismith Player of the Year Award\nAssociated Press Player of the Year\nMost Outstanding Player of the NCAA tournament\nBig East Player of the Year\nBig East Rookie of the Year\nBig East Defensive Player of the Year\nFirst Team All-American\nSecond Team All-American\nThird Team All-American\nHonorable Mention All-American\nNational Coach of the Year\nBig East Coach of the Year\nSeason-by-season results.\nConference Championships: 11\nConference tournament championships: 11\nNCAA Tournament\nNational Invitation Tournament\nPostseason history.\nNCAA tournament seeds.\n\"The NCAA began seeding the tournament with the 1979 edition.\"\nNCAA tournament results.\nThe Hoyas have made 31 appearances in the NCAA Division I men's basketball tournament.

The two schools have been playing each other since 1930, but their rivalry was solidified in the 1980s as the respective programs were the leading powers during the infancy of the newly formed Big East conference. In 1980, the first season of new conference, Georgetown famously ended Syracuse's 57-game home winning streak in the final game to be played at Manley Field House before moving to the Carrier Dome. After the win, Georgetown coach John Thompson declared, \"Manley Field House is officially closed\". Weeks later, the two schools met in the inaugural Big East Championship, with Georgetown prevailing 87–81. The teams met in four Big East tournament championship games during the 1980s, with Georgetown winning all four contests.\nThe animosity between the programs was further extended when Syracuse announced their decision to leave the Big East effective in 2013 to join the ACC, forcing the split of \"Catholic Seven\" and the football-playing schools. This led to the creation of the reformed Big East Conference and the American Athletic Conference. However, Georgetown and Syracuse have continued to play each other in all but one of the years following their exit from the conference. The rivalry is currently renewed through the 2022–23 season.\nVillanova University\nAs a fellow Catholic institution and conference foe, Villanova has been a natural rival for the Hoyas for many years. The schools are arguably two of the most successful programs among the group of teams that currently make up the Big East Conference. The rivalry is best known for the 1985 NCAA Championship Game where No. 8-seeded Villanova shocked the highly favored and top-ranked Hoyas 66–64, preventing Georgetown from winning back-to-back titles.\nAmong current Big East Conference foes, only Villanova has the more Final Four appearances (6) than Georgetown (5).\nSt. John's University\nHaving first played each other in 1909, St. John's is one of Georgetown's oldest rivals. The two teams played off and on since that first contest until 1965, when they began annually scheduled games, and they only intensified when both programs became founding members of the Big East Conference in 1979. The rivalry was brought to national attention during the 1984-85 NCAA Division I men's basketball season when both programs were ranked No. 1 and No. 2 throughout the season and met on a total of four occasions, including the famous \"Sweater Game\" at Madison Square Garden, the 1985 Big East Championship, and the 1985 Final Four. The Hoyas won 3 of the 4 matchups that year.\nThe rivalry gained renewed interest when both schools remained in the new Big East Conference following the many iterations of conference alignment.\nUniversity of Connecticut\nAn original member of the Big East, UConn and Georgetown battled for conference supremacy for multiple decades, until UConn left the conference to join the American Athletic Conference in 2013. One of the most intense periods for the rivalry was the 1995–1996 season where both teams found themselves ranked in the Top 5 throughout most of the year, led by stars Allen Iverson and Ray Allen respectively. During the regular season, Georgetown upset then ranked No. 3 UConn in Washington, D.C., but a few weeks later at Madison Square Garden, UConn prevailed in a classic Big East tournament Final 75–74, on a last second shot by Allen.\nUConn is the only team to match Georgetown's record of 10 regular season titles and is second behind the Hoyas in total conference tournament titles. The schools continued to play each other in their non-conference schedule, and have renewed their rivalry now that UConn has returned to the league in 2020.\nBlue and gray.\nGeorgetown's official colors are blue and gray. The colors were selected in 1876 by the Georgetown College Boat Club (the original crew team) in honor of Georgetown students and alumni who wore the Union blue and Confederate gray in the Civil War. A student committee declared blue and gray \"as appropriate colors for the Boat Club and expressive of the feeling of unity between the Northern and Southern boys of the College\", and recommended its adoption for the team. By the time the men's varsity basketball team was formed, the blue and gray colors were already widely adopted by the school.\nPresently, Georgetown is one of the few teams to wear gray as their primary home uniform color, as traditionally teams wear white uniforms at home (though the Hoyas do have a white alternate jersey that is worn on occasion). Fans are generally encouraged to wear gray to home games, and sellouts are referred to as a \"gray out.\"\nKenner League.\nEach summer Georgetown University's McDonough Gymnasium hosts the Kenner League. Named after one of the founders and first director of the Metropolitan Police Boys' and Girls' Club of Washington, D.C., the Kenner league is the only NCAA sanctioned summer league in Washington, D.C. Formed in 1982, the league allows Georgetown players to continue their development in an NCAA-structured environment, and to stay within view of watchful eyes on a college campus (even if the coaches were not allowed there by NCAA rules). From its humble beginnings, the Kenner legacy continued to build throughout the 1980s, with coverage in \"The Washington Post\" beginning around 1986, then a high school bracket following soon thereafter, and ultimately the arrival of \"senior\" teams featuring a mix of former Georgetown players, visiting NBA stars, and local hoop legends.\nKenner continued to grow, with more fans making the trip weekly to the gymnasium for a series of weeknight and weekend games each summer. As new recruits arrived at Georgetown, following them at the Kenner League became a priority for fans. Many fans might think Georgetown runs the Kenner League, but it does not. The league is an independent effort, whose organizers must raise money from Nike and team sponsors to cover the cost of officials, jerseys, and other organizational costs, and maintain NCAA certification. As summer leagues go, Kenner is among the longest running of its kind. Since the league has been in existence, nearly 200 Georgetown players have played in the Kenner League. After nearly a two year break due to COVID-19, Kenner League returned in the summer of 2022.\nAlumni.\nThe Hoyas have an excellent history of preparing players for the NBA. Two Hoyas were the NBA first overall draft picks: Patrick Ewing in 1985 and Allen Iverson in 1996. Alonzo Mourning was the second overall pick in the 1992 draft. Dikembe Mutombo also was drafted in the first round, 4th overall Other alumni have gone undrafted, but entered the NBA later, such as Jaren Jackson in 1989 and Henry Sims and Chris Wright in 2013.\nSeveral Hoya basketball players are famous purely for their off-court accomplishments. Brendan Gaughan, who walked onto the basketball squad, is a driver in NASCAR's Truck Series and also raced one season in the Cup Series. James L. Jones, who played for the Hoyas in the mid-1960s before joining the Marine Corps, went on to become Commandant of the Marine Corps, Supreme Allied Commander Europe, and President Obama's National Security Advisor. Paul Tagliabue, who played in the early 1960s and was one of the leading rebounders in school history, became Commissioner of the National Football League from 1989 to 2006 and later served as Georgetown's Chairman of the board of directors. Henry Hyde, who led Georgetown to its first national final, was elected a member of Congress from Illinois and Chairman of House Judiciary Committee. He received the nation's highest civilian honor, the Medal of Freedom. William Shea, who played in the 1920s, was the New York attorney who brought the New York Mets to the city. Shea Stadium, now demolished and replaced on-site by the Mets' current home of Citi Field, was named in his honor."

        "text": "The Georgetown University Rugby Football Club is the intercollegiate men's rugby union team that represents Georgetown University in the Mid-Atlantic Rugby Conference of National Collegiate Rugby, Division II. They have twice reached the USA Rugby National Tournament Final Four, in 2005 and 2009.\nEarly history.\nThe Georgetown University Rugby Football Club (GURFC) was founded in the spring semester of 1967 by former members of the Washington D.C. Rugby Football Club. The founder was a Georgetown University Law student Michael Murphy. In the early history of the club, GURFC fielded both an “A” and “B” sides, while occasionally mustering the numbers for a “C” side. The team played a variety of teams in its early years including UVA, the Washington RFC, the Baltimore RFC and the Quantico Marines RFC. The team also played the University of Notre Dame as well as a visiting university team from Chile. In the fall of 1968, GURFC hired its first coach to the program, which only lasted until the Spring. During this time, John Clisham worked as the club president and Kevin Sullivan acted as Social Secretary.\nIn the fall of 1985, Georgetown Rugby set on a self-directed course in the PRU. Under the coaching / playing leadership of Dave Pegno (and his housemates), the team rallied through a building season that was to be foundational for the long list of championships and accolades to come post 1985. The leadership torch was passed to up and coming underclassman - Jim Thompson from New Zealand, Doug Brown from New Jersey and Tom Gletner from Maryland to guide the team through a rough transitional period. It was known as the protectorate period. Completing a .500 season in 1986 - the team began to gel as a true unit in 1987. After monumental victories over all PRU challengers - GU secured the regular season PRU championship in 1987 and dropped a 13-10 decision to Salisbury State in the league challenge match championship. Building on success - the team began to roll with undefeated season play in 1989 under the guidance of president / captain Doug Brown and PRU all-star Dan Kirk. The 1990 team featured 5 PRU all-stars and took advantage of Springbok coaching expertise from Heyn van Rooyen and Theo van Wyk.\nGeorgetown graduate students have played on the Georgetown Law Rugby Football Club since 2005. Current USA Rugby rules prevent graduate students from playing on the official university teams, despite the fact that most collegiate rugby clubs in the nation were started by graduate students. Despite its name, the Georgetown Law RFC is open to all Georgetown graduate programs.\nEvolution of the Officers.\nIn the early days of the club, the “officers” consisted of a scrum captain, a backs captain, a president, a VP/Treasurer, and a secretary. The 5 \"officers\" would determine the A, B, and C side rosters each week. In 1970-1971, John Kelly was president, Jack Schmidt was the (Match) Secretary, Joe Pulosi and Mike (Last Name Unknown) were the captains, and Leonard Natoli, Jr. served as the Vice President/Treasurer. At the time, the Vice President's role was to co-ordinate social events. The officers have remained relatively unchanged over time except for the division of the duties of Vice President and Treasurer into the three posts of Treasurer, Vice President, and Social Chair. Along the way, it was deemed necessary to separate the Social activities from the Financial responsibilities.\nAfter adjustments to the club constitution in 2021 and 2022, the current board is composed of 9 members, ranked in terms of seniority: Captain, President, Treasurer, Social Chair, Match Secretary, Webmaster(social media chair), Alumni Relations Chair, Vice President, and Recruitment chair. Elections occur during town hall meetings at the end of every fall semester.\nRecent Seasons.\nThe 2001 fall season marked Georgetown's last year in Division I. The 2001 season was a building year for the team.\nThe spring and fall 2002 seasons marked a new start for Georgetown that began with a last minute victory over Catholic University in the Capitol Cup tournament.\nDuring the fall of 2002, Georgetown moved from Division I to Division II. They subsequently won the Potomac Rugby Union's Division II championship.\nSince 2004, the Club has been a sponsor of the annual Run For Rigby to raise money for off-campus housing safety awareness.\nThat same season, Georgetown shut out Salisbury University in the PRU championship, avenging their last minute loss to Salisbury in 2003.\nThe spring 2005 season marked Georgetown's championship run into Final Four of the USA Rugby National Tournament.\nDuring the Spring 2009 season, Georgetown did not participate in the annual Capitol Cup tournament due to a scheduling conflict with the National D2 Playoffs.\nGeorgetown in 2009 defeated #1 seed Cal Maritime, 20-17, in the quarterfinals to advance to the National D2 semifinals. This marks the second time in school history that the Hoya Ruggers have reached the Final Four of the USA Rugby National Tournament.\nIn 2013, the club formally organized a competitive Rugby Sevens side which placed 11th out of 24 teams in the Las Vegas Invitational. In 2014, 2016 and 2017 the sevens team won the James River Christmas Sevens tournament in Richmond, VA, held annually in December. In February 2015, the side went on to win the Bowl Championship at the Las Vegas Invitational with a record of four wins and two losses.\nIn the fall of 2016, the club moved up to Division 1AA Chesapeake Collegiate Rugby Conference.\nIn 2019, the club won its first Cherry Blossom Tournament Championship since 2014, beating D1 conference rivals Towson and Maryland in the process.\nIn 2020, the club dropped down to the Division II Mid-Atlantic Rugby Conference in National Collegiate Rugby. \nIn the 2021/22 season, the year after the COVID-19 pandemic, the club won five trophies. In the fall of 2021, the 15s team won the Mid-Atlantic Regional Conference (MARC) and lost in the Elite Eight of the National Championship. In the spring of 2022, the club won the Cherry Blossom Tournament, Capitol Cup, and the MARC 7s Championship. The 7s team lost in the Elite Eight of the National Championship 7s tournament, too.\nIn the spring 2023 season, the team achieved a string of four consecutive conference championships by defeating Scranton in the MARC 7s championship. This victory sent GURFC to the nationals tournament in Boyds, Maryland, where the team achieved a joint 3/4 place with Norwich following a close semi-final defeat to NC State. This came after victories over UNCW, University of Chicago, and Memphis.\n1st XV 2022-2023.\n7s Squad 2020"

        "title": "Philadelphian cricket team",
        "text": "The Philadelphian cricket team was a team that represented Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in first-class cricket between 1878 and 1913. Even with the United States having played the first ever international cricket match against Canada in 1844, the sport began a slow decline in the U.S. This decline was furthered by the rise in popularity of baseball. In Philadelphia, however, the sport remained very popular and from the end of the 19th century until the outbreak of World War I, the city produced a first class team that rivaled many others in the world. The team was composed of players from the four chief cricket clubs in Philadelphia–Germantown, Merion, Belmont, and Philadelphia. Players from smaller clubs, such as Tioga and Moorestown Cricket Club, and local colleges, such as Haverford and Penn, also played for the Philadelphians. Over its 35 years, the team played in 88 first-class cricket matches. Of those, 29 were won, 45 were lost, 13 were drawn and one game was abandoned before completion.\nHistory.\n1870s and 1880s.\nWhen Fitz Fitzgerald's team from England toured North America in 1872, they played a match against Philadelphia over three days beginning on September 21. The match was played at the Germantown Cricket Club Ground, Nicetown, Philadelphia. It was not a first-class fixture, the Philadelphians having 22 players and the visitors, who won by 4 wickets, having 12. Amongst the English players were W. G. Grace, the future Lord Harris and A. N. Hornby. Grace did little as a batsman, but took 21 wickets (out of a possible 42) in the match.\nThe first time that the Gentlemen of Philadelphia played a first-class cricket match was on October 3, 1878 against Australia. This match took place on the Australians' trip home after playing in England earlier in the year. The game was a three-day match, and finished in a low scoring draw, with Australia still needing 43 runs when the game ended. The following year saw Ireland visit for two matches against the Philadelphians. The first match was a two-day game which the home side won by an innings. This was followed by a one-day game which was won by the Irish.\nThe next time the Philadelphians played in a first-class match was in 1883, when they played the USA national side in a first-class match. They lost this game by 8 wickets, but gained revenge when the fixture was played again the next year, winning by 3 wickets. This match then became an occasional game played between the best amateur players of Philadelphia and the country's best professionals. The fixture was played six times between 1885 and 1894. Also in 1884, the Gentlemen of Philadelphia toured the United Kingdom. \nIn 1885, a team from England organized by Edward (Ned) Sanders visited Philadelphia, playing two first-class matches. The English side, captained by Richard Thornton, split the series with the Philadelphians. The team toured again the following year with more success, winning both matches. In 1888 Ireland visited Philadelphia, playing two first-class games which were both won by the Philadelphians. The final tour of the decade came in 1889 when the Gentlemen of Philadelphia again toured the UK.\n1890s.\nThe decade of the 1890s marks the golden age of Philadelphian cricket. This was the period in which the most well-known players from the team made their marks. The first match of the decade for the Philadelphians that is classified as first-class was played against a team of English Residents. This fixture had been played annually from 1880 to 1883. This was the last time it was played, and the only time it featured a team specifically named as the Philadelphians, who won the game by six wickets. In 1891 a team led by Lord Hawke visited from England, playing two matches. The Philadelphians won a high-scoring first match but the tourists won a low-scoring second match, Sammy Woods taking 15 wickets.\n1892 saw Ireland visit Philadelphia. The teams each won one match, with one game drawn. This series was notable as it was the debut of Bart King, who would go on to a successful career bowling for the Philadelphians. The following year saw the first visit of Australia since the game in 1878. It visited on its way home from a tour of England. Australia fielded a strong side, but the team was tired after a long tour and trip. In spite of this fatigue, the Australians chose to face the full strength of the Gentlemen of Philadelphia. On a small ground at Elmwood, the September grass was coarse and rolled very fast. The Australian side, fielding first, dropped many balls and could not cope with the short boundary. They allowed the Philadelphians to run up a total of 525 runs. When the Australians came to bat, they had hoped that they were recovered from their journey, but they soon encountered Bart King's developing swing. The side was all out for 199, and King took 5 wickets for 78 runs. The Australians followed on and were all out again for 268, allowing the Gentlemen of Philadelphia to win by an innings and 68 runs. This win came about with the help of Bart King's batting and, more importantly, his bowling. The Australians won the return match by six wickets, but the Australian captain, Jack Blackham, said to the Americans, \"You have better players here than we have been led to believe. They class with England’s best.\"\nIn 1894 a second team led by Lord Hawke visited from England, playing two matches. Lord Hawke's XI won the first match at Merion with the Philadelphians coming back to win the second at Germantown's Manheim ground.\nIn 1897, the Philadelphian side toured England for 15 first class matches. Though the results may have been less satisfactory than hoped for by the promoters, the tour was arranged mainly for educational purposes and few of those on the American side expected to win many matches. Previous tours had tended to involve amateur English sides with a low level of competition. In 1897 a schedule was made including all of the top county cricket teams, the Oxford and Cambridge University teams, the Marylebone Cricket Club, and two other sides, though only a few of the counties thought it worthwhile to put their best elevens onto the field. Starting on June 7 at Oxford, the tour lasted for two months and ended in late July at The Oval. While it initially aroused some curiosity, many English fans lost interest until Bart King and the Philadelphians met the full Sussex team at Brighton on June 17. In the first innings, King proved his batting worth in a fourth-wicket stand of 107 with John Lester. He then took 7 wickets for 13 runs and the team dismissed Sussex for 46 in less than an hour. In the second innings, King took 6 for 102 and helped the Philadelphians to a victory by 8 wickets. Despite the excitement surrounding the team's performance, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, but only two were won, while the team lost nine and drew four. The other win of the tour came against Warwickshire.\nThis tour was followed by a two-game series at home against a team captained by Plum Warner in which each team won a match. Warner again brought a team the following year, this time winning both games. The decade was rounded out with a tour by a team captained by Kumar Shri Ranjitsinhji. This team won both matches against the Philadelphians in 1899.\n1900s and 1910s.\nIn 1901 Bernard Bosanquet brought an English team to Philadelphia. The four match series ended tied. The Philadelphians again toured England in 1903, playing 15 first-class games. The team was more successful than in 1897, this time winning six, losing six and drawing three. Bart King continued his successful form on this tour. In the first innings against Lancashire, he bowled 27 overs and took 5 wickets for 46 runs. After the Philadelphians surpassed Lancashire, their lead was quickly wiped away in the second innings. With the wind strong over King’s left shoulder he went in to dominate the opposition. In his first over after the lunch break, he yorked one of the opening batsmen and his replacement with successive balls. In the second over he clean bowled two more batsmen, and in the third he bowled a stump out of the ground. He had taken 5 wickets for 7 runs. After this performance, King had to be rested in the field and one wicket was taken. On his return, he took four more to finish with 9 for 62. The Philadelphians won next morning by nine wickets. The tour of England was followed the same year by a visit from Kent to Philadelphia. The Marylebone Cricket Club visited for two tours in 1905 and 1907. The first series was drawn one game to one, and the second tour saw both games drawn.\nIn 1908 the Philadelphians undertook their third and final tour of England. They played ten first-class games on this tour, winning four and losing six. The tour was highlighted by Bart King, who took 87 wickets and topped the England bowling averages with the figure of 11.01. This was not bettered until 1958 when Les Jackson of Derbyshire posted an average of 10.99. They played three first-class games in Jamaica in 1908–09, their only tour of a country other than England.\nIn 1909, the Philadelphians played a two match home series against Ireland, in which they won both games by an innings. In the first of these games, Bart King took all ten Irish wickets in the first innings, and followed up that with a hat-trick in the second innings.\nThe second decade of the twentieth century was the last for first-class cricket in Philadelphia, with baseball increasing its dominance over American sports. With the formation of the Imperial Cricket Conference in 1909 specifically excluding countries from outside the British Empire, American cricket had little influence on the global game. This exclusionary policy undercut any momentum to professionalize cricket in the USA. There were still two more first-class tours by Australia, however. The first was a drawn two match series in 1912. The final series was a three match affair, with the Australians winning two games, and one drawn. The drawn game, played on June 28, 1913 was the last first-class game played in the USA until the national side played an Intercontinental Cup game against Canada in Fort Lauderdale, Florida in 2004. Today, cricket is played in Philadelphia, but it has not reached the same heights it did during this golden age."

        "text": "The Optimists Cricket Club, known simply as the Optimists or abbreviated to OCC, is a cricket club based in Walferdange, in central Luxembourg. The Optimists play matches in various formats and competitions and, being the largest club in Luxembourg and the only one with its own ground, works in close cooperation with the Luxembourg Cricket Federation to help organise cricket in the Grand Duchy.\nHistory.\nThe Optimists are the oldest cricket club in Luxembourg, having been founded in 1976 by British expatriates, whose ranks had been swollen by Luxembourg City's growth as a financial centre and by the UK's entry into the European Economic Community.\nThe Optimists participate in both the Belgian Cricket League and the Luxembourg Cricket League but its main competitive focus is in the Belgian cricket league, which it won on three occasions in the early 1990s (1991, 1994, 1995). The Optimists 1st XI have won the 2nd division of this competition five times in the last seven seasons (2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2021) but are currently prohibited from promotion to the top division due to the Belgian Sports Ministry's policy on clubs situated outside Belgian territory. The Optimists 2nd XI re-entered the Belgian cricket league in 2018 and either won and/or gained promotion from the division it was competing in each season.\nGround.\nThe club plays at the Pierre Werner Cricket Ground, in Walferdange. The ground is named after the late Pierre Werner, a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg (1959–74, 1979–84). Werner had fallen in love with cricket when living in London in 1930, and went on to become the Honorary President of the OCC, which had been established when he was Prime Minister. Werner opened the OCC's new ground when it was opened in 1992. Widely viewed as the best cricket grounds in mainland Europe (excluding grounds in the Netherlands), the ground lies in the picturesque setting just ten minutes from Luxembourg City center. It boasts a large outfield, four practice bays, a clubhouse with catering facilities, a cricket/tennis pavilion and various other amenities.\nFacts.\nThe club is currently captained by Mohit Dixit and Joost Mees is the chairman of the club's committee.\nThe club's sponsors have included New Delhi Restaurant, Citco, Brasserie Nationale, Citadel, Dresdner Bank, Schroders, as well as support from the commune of Walferdange."

        "title": "Central Vikings Rugby Union",
        "text": "Central Vikings Rugby Union was a New Zealand rugby union team that played in the second division of the NPC for two seasons in 1997 and 1998. The team, formed from the merger of the Hawke's Bay and Manawatu unions, featured current and future All Blacks and a former All Black in coach Frank Oliver. It came second in its division in 1997, and first in 1998, and would have progressed to the first division. However, following financial trouble it split back into the two separate unions.\nReviving the Central Vikings as a Super Rugby team was floated in 2016, but this did not occur. \nHistory.\nThe Central Vikings Rugby Union was founded in December 1996 with the merger of the Hawke's Bay and Manawatu unions. The Vikings were formed with the hopes of lifting themselves out of the 2nd division and to be competitive in the 1st division. The Central Vikings had two All Blacks in the team which included Bull Allen and Christian Cullen as well as featuring various Super 12 players such as Chiefs star Mark Ranby who later became an All Black himself. The Central Vikings finished 2nd in 1997 when they were beaten 63–10 by Northland but even if they had won, they weren't allowed to progress into the 1st division. They finished 1st in 1998 when they beat Bay of Plenty. They were subsequently allowed to progress to the 1st division. The Vikings however got into financial trouble and they split back to Hawke's Bay and Manawatu for the 1999 season.\nThe Vikings were largely hindered in their second season after not only losing All Black legend Christian Cullen but also losing the then All Blacks Coach John Hart after Hart was advised he could not coach NPC, Super Rugby and All Black teams at the same time. Despite these disadvantages the Vikings went on to win the second division and were picked to be a major force in the first division before financial problems prevented them from advancing and ultimately caused the end of the Vikings.\nWith the announcement that New Zealand might receive a 6th Super Franchise in the SANZAR Super Rugby competition beginning 2016, the Hawke's Bay union announced its interest in forming this franchise together with Manawatu, effectively resurrecting the Central Vikings brand as a Super Rugby franchise. This never came to fruition and instead Super Rugby added the South African Southern Kings, the Argentinian Jaguares and the Japanese Sunwolves.\nControversy.\nIn December 1997 a special meeting of the Hawke's Bay Rugby Football Union was held to decide the future of the Central Vikings Rugby Union. Eight of the Hawke's Bay Union's 21 clubs called the meeting to seek agreement for Hawke's Bay to withdraw from the Vikings. A vote on a resolution calling for Hawke's Bay to withdraw from the combined Hawke's Bay–Manawatu team was lost, 7–12, in a secret ballot. Once the resolution was lost, HBRFU president Tom Mulligan said there was no reason for the meeting to continue. The Vikings were then given the all-clear to continue as an NPC second division rugby team.\nFixtures and results.\n1997 Season.\nThe Central Vikings played their first match against Fiji in Palmerston North on June 2, 1997.\n1998 Season.\nFormer Manawatu rugby captain and All Black trialist Andrew McMaster returned from Ireland, where he had four years coaching the Monkstown club, to join the Central Vikings as the new Vikings assistant coach. The Central Vikings had a non-championship match against Southland on 1 August 1998. Southland only just managed to hold on to the game, although they scored five tries to the Vikings two.\nSouthland 31 (P Taylor 2, P Alatini, B Leckner, P Miller tries; A Kimura 3 cons)\nCentral Vikings 29 (A Powdrell, D Bellamy tries; J Cunningham 2 cons, 5 pens). Halftime 19-13 to Southland."

He played college football at Auburn University. He won Super Bowl XXVII and Super Bowl XXVIII with the Cowboys back-to-back, beating the Buffalo Bills in both games.\nEarly years.\nAgee attended Maplesville High School, where he earned All-state honors in football, basketball, and track. He also practiced baseball.\nHe accepted a football scholarship from Auburn University. His best season came as a redshirt freshman playing in a wishbone offense, on a backfield that included Bo Jackson, Lionel James and Brent Fullwood. He was third on the team with 115 carries for 604 yards (5.3-yard average) and 4 touchdowns.

        "text": "James P. Burt (born June 7, 1959) is an American former professional football player who was a nose tackle for the New York Giants and San Francisco 49ers of the National Football League (NFL). Burt was a member of the Giants team that won Super Bowl XXI and the 49ers team that won Super Bowl XXIV. He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes.\nCollege career.\nBurt played college football at the University of Miami and was inducted into its sports hall of fame. Raised in western New York state, he had dreamed of playing for Syracuse, but they advised him to attend prep school first.\nProfessional career.\nBurt joined the Giants as an undrafted free agent in 1981. He made the Pro Bowl in 1986 and finished his career with 20 quarterback sacks. Burt was respected throughout the league for his toughness and determination, which resulted in him going from being an undrafted rookie free agent to a Pro Bowler. He is also known for knocking out 49ers quarterback Joe Montana on a pass in . Montana's pass was picked off and returned for a touchdown by Giants linebacker Lawrence Taylor. The Giants won, 49-3, on their way to winning Super Bowl XXI.\nAlthough many people often credit Harry Carson and Lawrence Taylor with inventing the \"Gatorade Shower\" on coaches following wins, Burt actually created it in 1984. The Giants had finished 3–12–1 in 1983, last place in the NFC East and third-worst in the 28-team league. As Carson stated in his 1987 book \"Point of Attack: The Defense Strikes Back\", head coach Bill Parcells was especially hard on Burt in practice. Parcells on the Thursday before the game made Burt raise a dumbbell repeatedly off the ground in the weight room for 45 minutes to simulate raising his arm powerfully out of his stance at the snap of the ball. Burt exacted revenge on Parcells after a 37–13 home win over the two-time defending NFC champion Washington Redskins on October 28 by dousing him with a cooler of water. The following season, the Giants dumped Gatorade on Parcells on October 20; it was another home win over the Redskins, but after consecutive losses to Dallas and Cincinnati. This became a tradition in football, analogous to the champagne showers teams make in their locker rooms after winning a championship.\nBurt was known to wear an extremely tight jersey causing him to stick out in a crowd. To protect against opposing players grabbing onto his jersey he opted to wear one that was several sizes smaller. He would need assistance pulling it on and off for each game, sometimes even using scissors to cut off the jersey after the game.\nBurt battled back problems with the New York Giants which ultimately caused Parcells to announce his retirement in 1988. Burt, however, was not ready to retire and instead joined the San Francisco 49ers for the 1989 season. He won his second NFL title when they defeated the Denver Broncos 55–10 in Super Bowl XXIV.\nDuring the 2006 season, Burt travelled to Dallas to give moral support to his former tormentor Parcells who was then head coach of the Dallas Cowboys. He also delivered a pre-game speech and stood on the sidelines exulting Dallas' defensive players.\nPersonal.\nBurt's son Jim Burt, Jr. followed in his father's footsteps and went to the University of Miami, but played baseball rather than football for the Hurricanes. Jim Jr. also played for a Connecticut-based collegiate baseball team, the Torrington Twisters.\nBurt lived in Allendale, New Jersey when he was playing for the Giants. He has since been a resident of Saddle River, New Jersey.\nHe played high school football in Orchard Park, New York, a suburb of Buffalo and the home of the Bills. His teammates at Orchard Park High School included Craig Wolfley, later an offensive lineman with the Pittsburgh Steelers, and Larry Pfohl, who found fame as professional wrestler Lex Luger."

        "title": "Baseball in the United Kingdom",
        "text": "Baseball is a growing, minor sport in the United Kingdom, with an estimated 22,500 people playing in 2020.\nThe sport is governed by the British Baseball Federation, which runs a multi-tier national league. There are also independent regional leagues, and around 20 universities field teams currently in existence. At various times in history professionalism has existed, most notably the 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain.\nIn 1938 the Great Britain national baseball team won the Baseball World Cup, and were runners-up in the 1967 and 2007 European Baseball Championship. As of 2020 Great Britain competed internationally at under 12, under 15, under 18, under 23 and senior levels. The under 23 team placed fifth at the 2019 European Under 23 Baseball Championship.\nDespite relatively low numbers of participation today, historically there have been a number of players born in the United Kingdom to have played in Major League Baseball. Of over 90 players who have played in MLB Danny Cox, Lance Painter and Bobby Thomson are most notable. Thomson hit the Shot Heard 'Round the World that took the New York Giants to the World Series in 1951.\nMajor League Baseball players born in the United Kingdom.\nOver 90 players born in the four constituent nations of the United Kingdom and pre partition Ireland have played professionally in Major League Baseball. This does not include players born outside the United Kingdom but of British heritage or players who have played in MLB and represented the Great Britain national baseball team, but who were born outside the United Kingdom.\nInductees to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum.\nHenry Chadwick, born in Exeter, was a sportswriter, baseball statistician and historian, often referred to as the \"Father of Baseball\", for his early reporting on and contributions to the development of the game. He edited the first baseball guide that was sold to the public. He is credited with creating box scores, as well as creating the abbreviation \"K\" that designates a strikeout. He is said to have created the statistics of batting average and earned run average (ERA).\nTom Connolly, born in Manchester, was a umpire in Major League Baseball. He officiated in the National League from 1898 to 1900, followed by 31 years of service in the American League from 1901 to 1931. In over half a century as an American League umpire and supervisor, he established the high standards for which the circuit's arbiters became known, and solidified the reputation for integrity of umpires in the major leagues.\nHarry Wright, born in Sheffield, was himself described by fellow Hall of Fame inductee Henry Chadwick as \"the father of professional base ball”. Although not born in the United Kingdom, George Wright is another inductee of United Kingdom heritage. George is the brother of Harry, and his parents were born in England.\nCornelius McGillicuddy, better known as Connie Mack, was a catcher, manager, and team owner. The longest-serving manager in Major League Baseball history, he holds records for wins (3,731), losses (3,948), and games managed (7,755). Mack was born in Brookfield, Massachusetts, in what is now East Brookfield on December 22, 1862. His mother, Mary McGillicuddy, was an immigrant from Belfast, his father was from pre-partition Ireland.\nJohn McGraw, born in Truxton, New York, was player and manager who was for almost thirty years manager of the New York Giants. His parents emigrated from pre-partition Ireland, around 1850. Similarly with parents who emigrated from pre-partition Ireland, Roger Bresnahan was nicknamed \"the Duke of Tralee\" and was a player and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). As a player, Bresnahan competed in MLB for the Washington Senators, Chicago Orphans, Baltimore Orioles, New York Giants, St. Louis Cardinals and Chicago Cubs. Bresnahan also managed the Cardinals and Cubs.\nCharles Radbourn, nicknamed \"Old Hoss\", was a pitcher who played 12 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for Buffalo, Providence, Boston (National League), Boston (Player's League), and Cincinnati. He was born in New York, to parents who had emigrated from Bristol.\nAnother Hall of Famer who can trace their ancestry back to the United Kingdom is former British national team coach Trevor Hoffman, whose mother was English and whose grandfather was a professional footballer with Southend United.\nMajor League Baseball players who have represented the United Kingdom.\nEither through being born in the United Kingdom, via ancestral links to the United Kingdom or qualifying via being born in a Commonwealth member nation, a number of players with MLB experience have represented the United Kingdom internationally, via the Great Britain national baseball team. The most notable recent player is Jazz Chisholm Jr.\nHistory.\nOrigins.\nIt is argued that modern \"American baseball\" can trace its roots to 18th century Britain, with the earliest known mention and illustration of the game appearing in John Newbery's \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\" in 1744. The earliest known rules were printed in 1796, in Germany, as \"Das Englische Base-ball\".\nAlthough early codes of baseball may have originated in the United Kingdom, the American code of baseball, as North Americans would understand it, started to be played in the UK as early as the 1870s and it was fully developed by 1890, when the fully professional 1890 National League of Baseball of Great Britain was established. Since the 1870s many exhibition matches between North American teams have been staged in the United Kingdom, culminating in the MLB London Series in 2019, which sold out 120,000 tickets in less than an hour. As a result, a small number of MLB teams have fan led dedicated fan clubs in the United Kingdom.\nAmerican influence in the 19th century.\nIn the 1870s, baseball teams from the United States, including the Boston Red Stockings and Philadelphia Athletics, toured the United Kingdom, in an effort to popularise the sport, but with limited success. At that time, John Wisden and Co. were the most famous supplier of essential baseball equipment, \"as used by the baseball clubs now in England in all their matches\", which shows that organised clubs did exist in England in some form as early as the 1870s. Wisden remains a prominent name in international cricket today.\nIn 1888 the President of St. Louis, on returning to the United States from their European tour, remarked that \"England is now educated up to American sports\", and encouraged other American baseball club presidents to continue promoting the game in England. Later in 1888, John Barnes, of the Western League St. Paul club, discussed his plans to travel to England to establish a \"baseball syndicate\" in London, Birmingham and other large cities.\nIn 1889 the wealthy Albert Goodwill Spalding used his position as a former star player and as a leading sporting goods supplier to arrange yet another tour of the United Kingdom by American baseball stars including the Chicago White Stockings, building on the earlier tours in the past decades. As with previous tours the cricket establishment of England was used to promote baseball, with the Prince of Wales one of the \"very large number of spectators\" to witness the game at the Oval, and over 8,000 attended a game at Lord's. On arriving at Bristol, Spalding paid tribute to the English cricket star W. G. Grace, \"the best known Englishman in the world\".\nThis tour led to a number of new baseball clubs springing up, such as York Baseball Club, formed at Stotts Refreshment Rooms in Parliament Street as early as March 1889. The most notable of these new clubs was formed 1890, in Derby, as Ley's Recreation Club, by Francis Ley, a local man who had experienced the game on a trip to the United States. Following their first ever game (as Ley's Recreation Club) Ley began to appeal for \"professionals aged 20 to 25\" and \"cricketers who can field smartly\" to attend Ley's Recreation Centre to form a club, in March 1890 and Ley's Recreation Club became Derby Baseball Club. Despite evidence showing clubs such as York were formed slightly earlier than or at the same time as Derby, Ley erroneously claimed \"we were really the first club formed in Great Britain\" when discussing Derby in 1890.\nLey, who certainly had \"introduced baseball amongst his employees\" and was instrumental in providing superb facilities at Derby, was not in attendance in October 1889, when noted supporters of a new National League of Baseball of Great Britain met at the Criterion, London, to formally establish the new baseball association, though he was elected as a provisional officer. Representatives of Preston North End, Gloucester County Cricket Club, Essex County Cricket Club, Staffordshire County Cricket Club, Aston Villa and the National Rounders Association all were represented and elected as officers to the association, with Newton Crane elected to the chair.\nThe new association quickly moved to establish a headquarters at 38 Holborn Viaduct, London, from where it would agree on and promote a set of rules by which the new National League would be played. By July 1890 it was estimated that there were over 90 baseball clubs in England alone, with Derby Baseball Club being widely believed to be the best professional club in England. Yorkshire proved to be a surprising hotbed of baseball by 1890 when it was reported that \"there are more baseball clubs in Yorkshire than in any other county in England.\" It was not totally unexpected when the Secretary of Essex County Cricket Club, Morton Peto Betts, resigned his position to take up the role of Secretary of the newly formed Baseball Association of Great Britain, in July 1890.\nAston Villa, now known exclusively as a football club, won the only professional baseball championship in 1890. The competition was hindered by poor weather and disappointing crowds and made a loss for its investors. Aston Villa's win was not without controversy, however, with both Aston Villa and Preston North End being found guilty of cheating during the season. For much of the season Derby Baseball Club did lead the championship, however, pressure from other teams in the league over the number of American players on the Derby team and low attendances led to Derby being expelled before the end of the season, though at the time the club insisted they had \"retired\" as champions, despite evidence to the contrary.\nIn response to the accusations against Derby of employing too many talented American baseball players, Ley wrote letters to editors of newspapers to state \"Derby Baseball Club is the only one of the four League clubs to have not imported professional players from America\" and went to lengths to point out the lack of support Spalding provided to Derby compared to the other clubs, which he was a major shareholder in. Ironically, given the finger pointing at Ley for employing too many talented Americans, of the various American baseball players sent across to coach and play baseball in England, in the 1890 season, the most prominent was arguably Preston North End captain Leech Maskrey, who had played Major League Baseball. In August 1890 the Preston club organised a presentation for their captain, who was returning to the United States. Meanwhile, Spalding turned his attention to establishing collegiate baseball in the United Kingdom with very little success.\nIn March 1890 Edinburgh Northern Baseball Club began to meet for practice and Spalding's influence was obvious when The Spalding Baseball Club of Aberdeen sprung to life in July 1890, their headquarters being at 59 Princes Street. By August 1890 the financial backing of Spalding resulted in two local rivals emerging in Aberdeen, the Spalding Baseball Club and Aberdeen Baseball Club, who played at The Links. The two competed for the Spalding 50 guinea Challenge Cup and the right to take on the University Baseball Club of Edinburgh, evidence of Spalding's desire to establish collegiate baseball in the United Kingdom. Wales, possibly due to the continued popularity of British or Welsh Baseball, was slower to adopt the American game. In April 1893 The Cardiff Central were formed, and claimed to organise \"the first game of American baseball played in South Wales.\" They were based at Grangetown.\nThe Golden Age and Postwar Decline.\nBaseball's peak popularity in Britain was in the years immediately preceding World War II. A resurgence of professional baseball occurred in parts of the United Kingdom during the 1930s and baseball enjoyed its heyday before the Second World War, but the outbreak of war led to a decline. In this era professional baseball teams often shared grounds with football clubs and rugby league clubs, and drew crowds of up to 10,000 spectators per game. In 1933, in response to a challenge from Major League Baseball's National League President, John Haydler, the wealthy British gambling tycoon, Sir John Moores, established the National Baseball Association and continued to fund the establishment of amateur and professional leagues in England.\nOnce again American and Canadian expatriates swelled the rosters of the semi-profesional clubs, with a number of the Canadian professionals going on to represent the Great Britain national team. With this golden age UK baseball achieved a major milestone, in 1938, with the victory of the Great Britain national baseball team over the United States, in the Baseball World Cup. The series was created by Sir John Moores, with the 1939 Amateur World Series competition initially being named the John Moore's Cup.\nWith the backing of Sir John Moores a Great Britain team was given financial support to compete in the 1939 series, in Havana, as defending champions. In doing so they would have become the first national representative team to compete outside the United Kingdom but the outbreak of the Second World War interrupted the development of British baseball, the team withdrew and the sport entered into decline. Following the war, in July 1951, Wolsley Athletic (Birmingham) became the first baseball team from the United Kingdom to play in continental Europe, in an official game, in Belgium.\nAt present.\nAs of the 2021 season, there were 90 teams from 48 baseball clubs actively participating in leagues, and 1,500 adult and Junior (under 18) players competing for clubs based across a wide geographic area, of the island of Great Britain. Despite being a constituent nation of the United Kingdom, domestic baseball in Northern Ireland is affiliated to Baseball Ireland for practical reasons. Northern Ireland's only team, the Belfast Northstars, play in the Irish Adult League. Despite this quirk, Northern Irish born players such as P.J. Conlon are able to qualify to play for both Ireland and the United Kingdom internationally.\nThe British Baseball Federation (BBF) is the governing body for baseball in the UK and the baseball leagues. The season runs from April until August. Affiliated baseball clubs pay annual affiliation fees to be a member of the BBF and play in the BBF Leagues and Junior Leagues. There are three leagues independent of the British Baseball Federation: the Scottish National League, run by Baseball Scotland; the Northern Baseball League containing mainly teams based in Northern England; and the South West and Wales Baseball League, representing some of the teams in the South West of England, plus one team in Wales. There is also a full Great Britain Baseball Programme which comprises the Great Britain Baseball Academy, junior national teams and Great Britain 'Seniors' Baseball Team.\nThe BBF league format is divided into the national divisions, consisting of four tiers from the National League, down to the Single-A league. At the end of the season, all divisions compete in post-season tournaments where the top teams from each conference play knockout matches, with the winning teams then progressing to the Championship Series. The Championship Series of the National League is best of three; the AAA, AA and A championships are single games.\nThe Independent leagues compete against the teams in their own leagues, and in 2017 the first Independent leagues finals weekend was held at Hull, which consisted of semi-finals between the champions of the Independent leagues and a final held the next day. This was followed by an England v Scotland friendly All-Star game.\nBaseball in Universities.\nUniversity baseball in the United Kingdom has also been growing, with 75 teams from 35 universities currently participating in the sports. The university season runs from September to May, the typical off-season for the sport. Between 2013 and 2019, the National Champion was decided by the BaseballSoftballUK (BSUK)-run National University Championship, which was run as a bi-annual event. In 2020, the sport was admitted into the British Universities and Colleges Sport (BUCS) system, with a new national championship being held at the Farnham Park National Baseball &amp; Softball Complex. Initally, this was supposed to take place in 2021, but the season was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, delaying the launch of the new National Championship until the 2021-22 season\nIn 2023, the Univeristy of Central Lancashire made UK Baseball history by offering 2 students, Aflie Hill and Nathan Simmons, scholarships to play baseball. This is the first time (that is currently known of) that this has happened in the UK. \nList of National Champions.\nNational University Championships (BSUK).\nSources: \nCurrent League System.\nDue to the large turnover of teams (from baseball currently not being a professional sport in the United Kingdom), the league structure changes every season. For 2023, the format is the following:\n2024 Clubs.\n\"Note: This list does not contain clubs who failed to opt in to the 2024 league system and are officially listed as inactive. Youth teams are also not included.\""

        "text": "The Ghana national cricket team represents Ghana in men's international cricket. It is an associate member of the International Cricket Council, which it joined as an affiliate member in 2002, and mainly plays matches in Africa Cricket Association tournaments. Ghana Cricket Association promotes the sport in the country.\nA team representing the British Gold Coast played its first recorded match in 1904, and international matches from 1907. Known as Ghana after independence in 1957, until recent times the majority of the team's matches came against other West African teams, and occasionally against touring English teams. In 1976, Ghana joined the West Africa Cricket Council, with Ghanaian players representing the West African cricket team in international tournaments.\nFollowing the breakup of the council, the Ghana Cricket Association gained affiliate membership of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2002, with the national side making its debut at an ICC tournament in 2004. The first ICC tournament for the team was in Division Three of 2006 World Cricket League Africa Region, where it finished in the third place. The team won the Division Three of 2008 World Cricket League Africa Region by defeating Swaziland in the final.\nHistory.\nColonial era.\nCricketArchive records a team representing the Gold Coast, a British colony, as having played its first match in May 1904, against Lagos Colony (in present-day Nigeria). Similar fixtures were played in the following two seasons, with the venue alternating between Lagos and Accra. A team representing the Southern Nigeria Protectorate toured in April 1907. Similar matches were played again in 1911, 1912, and 1913, with the host alternating each year. Although the sport had been introduced by British settlers, representative teams were multiracial from an early stage – the 1912 Gold Coast–Southern Nigeria fixture, the only pre-war match for which a scorecard is available, featured names like Otoo, Sagoe, Agbokpo, and Akufo (for Gold Coast), and Layode and Oseni (for Southern Nigeria). Gold Coast's Otoo took six wickets in Southern Nigeria's second innings, helping Gold Coast to an innings victory. However, European-only matches were introduced around the same time, beginning in 1906 and ending only in 1956, the year before Ghanaian independence. The Gold Coast's leading run-scorer in the inaugural European-only fixture was Gordon Guggisberg, who had earlier played a single first-class match (and was later Governor of the Gold Coast, from 1919 to 1927).\nAfter a long gap, inter-colonial matches resumed in April 1926, when the Gold Coast played the Nigerian national team in Lagos. Gold Coast–Nigeria fixtures, both multiracial and European-only, were played almost annually from 1926 to 1939, and resumed again after World War II. In several years the European-only fixtures were played in provincial cities like Kumasi and Ibadan, although multiracial games were played only in the capitals. Gold Coast sides were occasionally bolstered by players of first-class standard – for instance, Cecil Pullan (Oxford University and Worcestershire) and Michael Green (Gloucestershire and Essex) appeared together in a 1937 match, with Pullan appearing again after the war. The national side played its first match as \"Ghana\" less than a month after Kwame Nkrumah's independence declaration in March 1957, with annual Ghana–Nigeria matches occurring until 1964.\nWest African era.\nA Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) side toured West Africa during the 1975–76 season, and played two matches at Accra's Achimota School in January 1976 – one against an Accra side and one against the Ghanaian national side. The West Africa Cricket Council was formed later in 1976, with The Gambia and Sierra Leone joining Ghana and Nigeria as members. Consequently, with the exception of the quadrangular West African Championships, first held in 1976, Ghanaian cricketers played international matches only for the combined West African team, which made its international debut at the 1982 ICC Trophy. The West African side at the 1997 ICC Trophy was captained by Edinam Nutsugah, a Ghanaian. At that tournament, another Ghanaian, Daniel Vanderpuje-Orgle, took 5/31 against Israel, one of only four five-wicket hauls at the tournament. However, the West Africa Cricket Council lost significance in 2000, when Nigeria applied for separate membership of the ICC. The council was disbanded in 2003, with its members having become ICC members the previous year – Gambia, Ghana, and Sierra Leone were made affiliate members, and Nigeria an associate member.\n2000-2018.\nA 2000 CricInfo article noted that cricket in Ghana was then confined to the south of the country, played only in the capital and the cities of Kumasi and Obuasi. It was also said to be particularly popular amongst the expatriate British and Indian populations, with the main club league featuring two Indian teams out of four total. Ghana played its first ICC tournament in March 2004, defeating Malawi in a play-off to finish third (of eight teams) in the Africa Affiliates Tournament. That tournament was part of the qualification process for the 2007 World Cup. The inaugural edition of the World Cricket League commenced in 2007, preceded by various regional qualifying tournaments. At the 2006 Africa Division Three qualifier, Ghana placed third behind Mozambique and Sierra Leone, again defeating Malawi in a third-place playoff. The playoff was noted for the performance of Ghanaian player Peter Ananya (a future national captain), who took 7/25 to bowl Malawi out for 41.\nGhana won the 2008 Africa Division Three tournament by defeating Swaziland in the final, having earlier bowled Rwanda out for 23 in their semi-final. They were subsequently promoted to the 2008 Africa Division Two tournament, but could only place fifth from six teams. This was enough, however, for Ghana to maintain its place for the 2010 Division Two event. At that tournament, they placed second to Zambia, securing entry to the 2012 Global Division Eight tournament. The only African side at the eight-team tournament, played in Samoa, Ghana lost only two matches, both to Vanuatu, placing runner-up and qualifying for the 2013 Global Division Seven event. Three of the six sides there were African, the others being Nigeria and Botswana, the hosts. Ghana won only two matches, both against Germany, and were relegated back to the regional tournaments system.\nIn international Twenty20 cricket, Ghana played its first tournaments in 2011, finishing runner-up to Nigeria in the 2011 Africa Division Two Twenty20 tournament and then fifth in 2011 Division One, both part of qualification for the 2012 World Twenty20. Earlier in the year, Ghana had hosted the Africa Division Three Twenty20, its first time hosting a senior ICC tournament. Ghana placed fourth at the 2012 Africa Division Two Twenty20, failing to qualify for the following year's Division One event. However, they went on to win the 2014 Division Two Twenty20, defeating Zambia on net run rate, and consequently progressing to the 2015 Africa Twenty20 Championship. There, Ghana defeated Tanzania, Botswana, and Uganda (for the first time), finishing fourth behind Uganda on net run rate. Against Uganda (a previous winner of the tournament), Ghana had made only 74/9 from its 20 overs, but managed to bowl Uganda out for 69.\nIn August 2018, they were included in the 2018 Africa T20 Cup tournament. However, Ghana declined Cricket South Africa's invite to compete in the tournament, and were replaced by Uganda.\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. All Twenty20 matches played between Ghana and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 had the full T20I status. Ghana's first T20I match was against Namibia on 20 May 2019, after finishing top of the North-Western sub-region qualification group, advancing to the Regional Final of the 2018–19 ICC World Twenty20 Africa Qualifier tournament.\nIn 2021 Ghana was among five teams excluded from the ICC T20I Championship for failing to play enough fixtures in the relevant period, an effect of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nCurrent squad.\nThis lists all the players who have played for Ghana in the past 12 months or has been part of the latest T20I squad. \n\"Updated as of 20 March 2024\"\nRecords and statistics.\nInternational Match Summary — Ghana\n\"Last updated 20 March 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nMost T20I runs for Ghana\nMost T20I wickets for Ghana\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2532.

        "title": "Country Rugby League",
        "text": "The Country Rugby League of New South Wales (CRL), formed in 1934 and disbanded in 2019, was the governing body for the sport of rugby league football in areas of New South Wales outside the Sydney metropolitan area until it merged with NSW Rugby League in 2019. The CRL was superseded by 6 NSWRL Country Divisions represented by 4 members of the nine-person NSWRL board. Despite its name, the CRL also governed rugby league in the Australian Capital Territory. Apart from selecting a Country Origin side to play in the annual City vs Country Origin game, the CRL administered many senior and junior competitions across the state.\nHistory.\nIn New South Wales, Newcastle was the first city outside Sydney to start a league competition, despite being involved in the Sydney Premiership in 1908–09 and then starting their own competition in 1910.\nOn 11 February 1911, the Hunter District Rugby Football League (HDRFL) was established at a large meeting in Maitland, thus becoming the first branch of the New South Wales Rugby League in \"the bush\" (i.e. outside the urban centres of Sydney and Newcastle). The HDRFL territory encompassed a lower part of the Hunter Valley from Singleton down to the Maitland district and towns on the nearby coalfields (the major ones being Cessnock, Kurri Kurri and Weston). Competition games were scheduled to kick off on 13 May but were pushed back to 20 May when clubs complained they had not had enough time to practice the new code. In the first senior-grade games played, West Maitland def. Kurri Kurri (12–0) and Cessnock def. Morpeth (23–0) in a double-header on the enclosed Albion Ground at Maitland. The first City v. Country match (advertised as such by the NSWRL in the \"Sydney Morning Herald\" of 10/6/1911) was played at the Sydney Agricultural Ground on that same Saturday, with City winning 29–8. The Country team was composed exclusively of players from the Newcastle (\"Northern\") and the Hunter competitions. The first ever country divisional match (described as such in the Maitland Daily Mercury of 31/7/1911) was played at Newcastle on 29/7/1911 between Newcastle and Hunter. Newcastle won 29–14. The first NSW Country team to tour was a squad of 17 players (12 from Newcastle and 5 from Hunter) that played three matches in Queensland between 5/8/1911 and 12/8/1911, defeating the Queensland State side twice and a Queensland Country representative side once. They then travelled to Sydney to play the Sydney Metropolitan team, again winning 31–24.\nOn 13 May 1911, another branch of the NSWRL was established in the Wollongong area.\nIn 1911, a Goldfields' League was formed in West Wyalong, and games were played in Tamworth, Aberdeen, and along the South Coast. The game was introduced to Orange in 1912 and spread quickly through the western districts. In 1913 branch leagues were formed at Bathurst, Dubbo, Nowra and Tamworth.\nIn 1920, the NSWRL set up a Country Committee. NSW Country was divided into six sections: South Coast, Northern Districts, Central Northern Districts, Western Districts, Southern, and North Coast. The group system was introduced in 1922, with neighbouring towns being organised into 12 groups.\nThe Country Rugby League (CRL) was officially formed in 1934, \"subject to the NSW Rugby League still being the paramount institution.\"\nIn 1939 a dispute arose between the CRL and the NSWRL. The CRL wanted a new administration structure, an equal partnership in which the NSWRL looked after league in Sydney, and the CRL looked after it in the bush. When their proposal was rejected the CRL broke away from the NSWRL for a week, but returned to the fold with a promise that a committee would be set up to sort things out. Eventually the CRL gave in on the grounds that it was in no one's best interests to have the game divided during World War II.\nThe NSWRL and CRL have since cooperated in the running of rugby league in NSW, including various 'joint ventures' such as the Ron Massey Cup which features three teams from areas under the control of the CRL.\nOn 24 August 2018, the NSWRL and CRL announced that they had entered into a Memorandum of Understanding which will involve formal discussions in relation to a possible merger that would see a merger of the two organisations. This would result with Rugby League in NSW governed by one body for the first time in more than 80 years.\nIn October 2019 CRL merged with the NSWRL after the NSWRL agreed a new constitution and the CRL voted to wind up its affairs immediately. The decisions made on 19 October and merger mean that the aim of a unified administration of the sport in NSW was achieved over a year ahead of time.\nRegions.\nThe CRL administered the following senior competitions:\nTeam of the Century.\nIn 2008, rugby league football's centenary year in Australia, the Country Rugby League named its 'Team of the Century':"

Cricket in the country is played mainly on the island of Corfu. This strong cricket tradition is due to the 50 years British rule of the Ionian islands at the time of the liberation of Greece from the Ottoman Empire. Efforts are currently underway to expand the game further outside Corfu.\nHistory.\nThe Greek cricket team appeared in every edition of the ECC Trophy from 1999 to 2005, hosting and winning the tournament in 1999. This enabled them to play in Division Two of the European Championship in 2000, finishing in sixth place. They once again played in the tournament in 2006, but this time they met with controversy. After winning all three of their first round group games, they looked to be a favourite for the tournament, and promotion to Division One. However, it was revealed that they had fielded two ineligible players and their wins were cancelled. Then they opted not to travel to RAF Lossiemouth to play Israel in the eighth place play-off, despite being fully aware that this would forfeit that game, and relegate them.\nIn September 2009 Greece took part in the 2009 European Cricket Championship Division Five in Corfu, Greece. The national team won the event with five wins out the five games .\n2018-Present.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members.

The Optimists, being the largest club in Luxembourg and the only one with its own ground, works in close cooperation with the Luxembourg Cricket Federation to help organise cricket in the Grand Duchy. The Optimists also organise other teams, which, whilst they play against the main side in the domestic tournament, will often pool their players with the Optimists' for matches against foreign opponents. The club plays at the Pierre Werner Cricket Ground, in Walferdange. The ground is named after the late Pierre Werner, a former Prime Minister of Luxembourg (1959–74, 1979–84). Werner had fallen in love with cricket when living in London in 1930, and went on to become the Honorary President of the OCC, which had been established when he was Prime Minister. Werner opened the OCC's new ground when it was opened in 1992. Widely viewed as one of the best cricket grounds in mainland Europe (outside of the Netherlands) the ground lies in a picturesque setting just ten minutes from Luxembourg City centre. It boasts a large outfield, four practice bays, a clubhouse with catering facilities, a cricket/tennis pavilion and various other amenities.\nLuxembourgish cricket's governing body is the Luxembourg Cricket Federation (), which was established in 1993 to organise the game in Luxembourg and to promote it to the non-British population. \nThe national team has competed in the forty-over European Cricket Council Division Four Championship. They came 11th in Vienna in 2003 (captained by Madhu Ramachandran), and gained a first victory (over Bulgaria) in Ljubljana in 2004 (captained by Adrian Wykes). In 2006 (captained by Romesh Paul) they narrowly missed out on promotion, having beaten Finland but then losing in the last over to Cyprus. In the corresponding tournament in Cyprus in September 2009, Luxembourg ended fourth out of six.\nIn recent years Luxembourg has had both a regular Men’s and an Under 15 (mixed) international team.\nLuxembourg cricketers who have played List A cricket - A.P.A.

        "title": "Fantasy cricket",
        "text": "Fantasy cricket is a part of the fantasy sports genre. It is an online game in which a virtual team of real cricket players is created and points are scored depending on how those players perform in real-life matches. To win a tournament, players must work towards attaining the maximum points and the highest rank on the leaderboard. \nFantasy cricket matches.\nA fantasy cricket match is based on batting and bowling orders, which are the most debated part of cricketing strategy. A small change in the order can change the course of the game. The concept involves selecting a team of 11 players and 3 substitutes from the pool of players who play the match. There are no budget caps and player selection is not limited to a particular number of batters, bowlers and all-rounders although in some fantasy applications you can only create team according to their prerequisite patterns. An example of their given pattern could be 5 batters, 1 wicket-keeper, 2 all-rounders, 3 bowlers. A fantasy team can have any type of players. The main aim in a fantasy cricket match is to outscore the opposition by as large of a margin as possible. Fantasy cricket matches can be played in all three international forms: One Day International, Twenty20 and Test Cricket. The limited over matches, namely the One Day Internationals and Twenty20s, are played in two formats – daily games and rounds.\nBy country.\nIndia.\nFantasy cricket is classified as a \"game of skill\", similar to fantasy sports in the United States. Fantasy Cricket for Cash is at the hub of three dynamic industry spokes – Internet, gaming and cricket.\nThe Supreme Court of India has explained skill in terms of superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness. In \"K.R. Lakshmanan v. State of Tamil Nadu\" AIR 1996 SC 1153, it stated as follows:\n\"A game of skill, on the other hand – although the element of chance necessarily cannot be entirely eliminated – is one in which success depends principally upon the superior knowledge, training, attention, experience and adroitness of the player.\"\nThe relevant excerpt from the Supreme Court's judgment is:\n\"There are few games, if any, which consist purely of chance or skill, and as such a game of chance is one in which the element of chance predominates over the element of skill, and a game of skill is one in which the element of skill predominates over the element of chance. It is the dominant element – 'skill' or 'chance' – which determines the character of the game.\"\nThe court categorically stated the meaning of skill (in paragraph 20), in the following terms: \"We, therefore, hold that the expression “mere skill” would mean substantial degree or preponderance of skill.\" In the case, the Court considered Section 11 of the Tamil Nadu Gaming Act, which excluded the application of the act to games of ‘mere skill’, and is in \"pari materia\" with Section 12 of the Public Gambling Act of 1867. In that case the Court concluded that horse-racing was a game of skill.\nUnited States.\nIn USA, cricket is enjoyed largely by Indian sub-continent diaspora. While fantasy (American) football is extremely popular, other sports including cricket lack mass appeal due to limited knowledge of the game in the country.\nIn USA, fantasy sports for cash is defined and exempted by the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006. The act included a provision that the law would not apply to fantasy sports games, educational games, or any online contest that \"has an outcome that reflects the relative knowledge of the participants, or their skill at physical reaction or physical manipulation (but not chance), and, in the case of a fantasy or simulation sports game, has an outcome that is determined predominantly by accumulated statistical results of sporting events, including any single score, point-spread, team performance, or individual performance in such sporting events…\""

        "text": "Baseball City Stadium was a stadium located in Davenport, Florida (near Haines City) that was in use from 1988 to 2002. It was a portion of the Boardwalk and Baseball theme park. The two facilities adjoined at the interchange of Interstate 4 and Route 27, about southwest of Orlando. The facility had five practice fields in addition to the stadium. It was primarily used for baseball and was the spring training home of Kansas City Royals prior to the team moving to Surprise Stadium in 2003. The ballpark had a capacity of 8,000 people.\nHistory.\nThe stadium was designed to be the cornerstone of the Boardwalk and Baseball theme park and opened on February 7, 1988. The Royals signed a 15-year contract, moved their spring training ballpark from Terry Park in Fort Myers, and relocated their Single A Florida State League affiliate, renamed The Baseball City Royals into the park for the 1988 season.\nThe stadium's first event was the 1988 Pizza Hut All-Star Softball game, played in front of 4,700 fans. The Royals played their first spring training game at the ballpark on March 4, 1988, in front of 3,281 who saw them lose 9-7 to the Houston Astros. \nThe Boardwalk and Baseball theme park rapidly proved itself a financial disaster. The owners and developers of the park, Harcourt Brace Jovanovich (now Harcourt, a division of Reed Elsevier), put little money into the park, and almost all money went into the baseball stadium. The property had originally been a failed amusement park called Circus World, and HBJ had simply renovated and re-opened the park, without adding new rides, hoping that the renaming along with the stadium would allow it to compete with nearby Walt Disney World. The park cut costs, including closing at dusk, and laying off several employees. In September 1989 HBJ sold the theme park and stadium to Anheuser-Busch, then operator of the Busch Gardens parks. In 1990 Anheuser-Busch closed the theme park, and by 1993 almost the entire amusement park had been torn down. Following the 1992 season, Kansas City moved their high class-A affiliate to the Wilmington Blue Rocks. The Baseball City FSL franchise was then shifted to Daytona Beach, where it became the Daytona Cubs.\nKansas City would continue to use the baseball stadium as it was a contemporary spring training facility and drew solid attendance numbers. Anheuser-Busch kept the stadium open rather than break the contract with the Royals. In 2001 the Royals moved their Rookie League team, the Gulf Coast League Royals into the stadium. When the contract expired at the end of the 2002 season, the Royals moved all of their spring training and rookie league operations to Surprise, Arizona, where a brand new $20 million park was being built and offered to any team willing to leave Florida. Soon after the Royals' departure, the stadium and the IMAX Theater, which were the only remaining parts of the original theme park, were demolished.\nPresent day.\nAfter sitting idle for over a decade, the land was sold to developer Victor Posner in 2001. The ballpark was torn down in 2005 to make way for the new Posner Park; a retail complex with several big box stores opened on the site in 2008."

The current South Coast Group 7 Official Historian has assisted with the provision of more recent tables as printed in association guidebooks and the \"South Coast Register\". Further research may add seasons the juniors only clubs participated which are currently not shown.\nHistory.\nFormative years.\nRugby league has been played in the South Coast region of New South Wales since 1913, with the first competition taking place between teams from the Shoalhaven district. In May 1914, with other rugby clubs from across the region also splitting from rugby union to join the new code, the South Coast Rugby League was formed. The first season of what is now known as the Group 7 competition began with eight teams competing. These teams included: Berry, Bombo, Gerringong, Jamberoo, Kiama, Kangaroo Valley, Naval College, and Nowra. The First round began on 30 May 1914, with Kiama defeating Gerringong 6–3, Naval College defeating Bombo 7–5, Jamberoo Superoos defeating Kangaroo Valley 3–0, and Nowra Warriors defeating Berry Magpies 3–0. The inaugural premiers were Gerringong, winning the final 11–10 at the Kiama Showground. As soon as the league began, they entered a two-year hiatus due to World War I. No competitions were held between 1916 and 1917. When the competition reformed in 1918, Gerringong again won the title. The Nowra Warriors were the next team to win the title in 1919.\n1920s.\nGerringong went on to win the title a third time in 1920, with a 3–0 win over Jamberoo. During 1925–26, some of the northern teams moved into Illawarra Rugby League competition, including Gerringong, who took out the Illawarra Premiership in 1925. Jamberoo won the premiership in 1927. As a result, they were the first team to represent the South Coast in the first championship between South Coast and Illawarra Premiers. Jamberoo (South Coast) defeated Port Kembla (Illawarra) 15–11. In 1929, Bombo won their first (and only) premiership.\n1930s.\nAfter winning their first premiership in 1929, Bombo merged with Kiama in 1930. The new entity, Bombo-Kiama, took out the title in their first season. They followed this up with another in 1933. Albion Park became re-affiliated with South Coast Rugby League in 1933. Milton-Ulladulla joined the league in the 1930s from Group 16 Rugby League. Between 1935 and 1937, the Berry Magpies won the premiership three years consecutively. Junior aged competitions (U-17's, 18's, 19's) were first introduced in 1938. The Shellharbour Sharks won their first premiership in 1939.\n1940s.\nAgain, the competition faced a hiatus, this time between 1942 and 1943, due to World War II. Albion Park won their maiden Premiership in 1944. Kiama (as a single entity) won the title in 1945. They went on to win a further three titles, becoming the first and only club to win four consecutive titles (1945–1948).\n1950s–1960s.\nFor a second time, between 1952 and 1954, Berry record premiership wins three years consecutively. In 1955, the league was renamed Group 7 Rugby League. Shellharbour won the Premiership in 1962 after a 23-year drought. In 1967, Bomaderry record their first premiership win.\n1970s–1980s.\nIn the 1970s, an expansion occurred when Warilla entered the first grade competition in 1970. They go on to win their first premiership in 1978. The Batemans Bay Tigers win their first premiership in 1979, after joining one year earlier in 1978 from Group 16. In 1980, the league was re-branded as South Coast Group Seven. Milton-Ulladulla record their first premiership win in 1987.\nModern times.\nA hat-trick of premierships is again recorded, this time by the Albion Park-Oak Flats Eagles between 1998 and 2000.\n\"Source: Group 7 Rugby League History\""

He previously played for Australian NRL clubs Canberra Raiders and Newcastle Knights, and European Super League clubs Catalans Dragons, Wigan Warriors, Hull Kingston Rovers and Salford Red Devils. He primarily played as a or . In 2009, he won the Albert Goldthorpe Medal.\nBackground.\nBorn in Junee, New South Wales, Dobson attended Erindale College and played his junior rugby league for the Junee Diesels, before being signed by the Canberra Raiders. In 2003 and 2004, Dobson played for the Australian Schoolboys team.\nProfessional playing career.\nCatalans Dragons.\nIn 2006, the Canberra Raiders loaned Dobson to French club Catalans Dragons of Super League as a replacement for injured halfback Stacey Jones.\nWigan Warriors.\nAfter impressing at the Catalans Dragons, Dobson attracted the attention of several other Super League clubs, subsequently being signed by the Wigan Warriors in May 2006. There was some controversy over Dobson's signing for the Wigan Warriors. Under English law, Dobson was not permitted to play in England because he did not have a work permit. However, the Wigan Warriors managed to obtain a work permit for him, albeit in controversial circumstances. When Dobson signed for the Wigan Warriors, they were at the bottom of the Super League table, 6-points behind the nearest team and heading towards relegation. Dobson's impact at the Wigan Warriors helped the team survive relegation in the 2006 season.\nIn 2006, Dobson was statistically the best goal-kicker in the world with a success rate of 84%, equal to or better than St. Helens' Jamie Lyon, 81% and National Rugby League players Hazem El Masri, 84% and Andrew Johns, 80%.\nCanberra Raiders.\nAt the end of 2006, Dobson rejoined the Canberra Raiders. In 2007, Dobson was the club's leading point-scorer. In April 2008, Dobson signed a -year contract with the Hull Kingston Rovers effective immediately after being released from his Raiders contract. He was also linked to Super League clubs Hull F.C. and .\nHull Kingston Rovers.\nIn 2009, Dobson helped the Hull Kingston Rovers into fourth place in only their third Super League season. His individual performances saw him become the second winner of the Albert Goldthorpe Medal which is presented by \"Rugby Leaguer &amp; League Express\".\nDobson started the 2010 season with a try and five goals in a 30–12 win over Salford City Reds.\nIn 2013, Dobson played for the Exiles against England. On 27 June 2013, Dobson signed a one-year contract with the Newcastle Knights starting in 2013 to return to the National Rugby League in Australia.\nNewcastle Knights.\nDobson started playing for Newcastle in the 2014 NRL season. Dobson played for the Knights in the inaugural Auckland Nines series prior to the 2014 NRL season in February 2014. With an injury to the Newcastle Knights regular Jarrod Mullen, Dobson made his top-grade début for Newcastle in their 30–8 defeat by Penrith Panthers. Dobson made 25 tackles in the game, the third highest on the day for the Newcastle club. Dobson also played against his former club Canberra Raiders (in a 20–26 defeat), Melbourne Storm (in a 28–20 defeat), Cronulla-Sutherland Sharks (in a 30–0 victory), North Queensland Cowboys (in a 28–2 defeat) and Brisbane Broncos (in a 48–6 defeat).\nOn 21 September 2014, Dobson was named at in the 2014 NSW Cup Team of the Year.\nSalford Red Devils.\nOn 22 May 2014, it was reported that the Salford Red Devils of the Super League, had recruited Dobson for the 2015 season. In the match report following Salford's 4–25 defeat by the Wigan Warriors, it was reported \"Salford will have re-inforcements next season with former Hull Kingston Rovers player Michael Dobson arriving from Australia after a far from happy time in the NRL.\"\nOn 16 June 2014, Dobson officially signed a four-year contract with the Salford club starting in 2015.\nCoaching career.\nAfter returning to Australia to play for the Wynnum Manly Seagulls, Dobson spent some time coaching in the junior ranks with the club, before taking up an opportunity at the Newcastle Knights."

        "text": "Nicholas Adam Hardwick (born September 2, 1981) is an American former professional football center who played in the National Football League (NFL), playing his entire 11-year career for the San Diego Chargers. He currently serves as the assistant offensive line coach for the Chargers. He was selected by the Chargers in the third round of the 2004 NFL draft, and was named to the Pro Bowl in 2006. He played college football for the Purdue Boilermakers.\nHigh school career.\nHardwick attended at Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis, Indiana. Unlike most future college and NFL players, he did not play high school football, having \"ditched\" the sport in the ninth grade. He was a three-year varsity letterman in wrestling and was as Indiana state runner-up as an individual, with his team winning a state championship.\nCollege career.\nHardwick was a sophomore economics major at Purdue University when his future San Diego Chargers teammate Drew Brees led the Boilermakers to the 2001 Rose Bowl. Inspired, he joined the football team as a walk-on, initially playing as a defensive tackle. The next year, he became the team’s starting center and earned all-Big Ten honors. During his senior year, his starting quarterback was Kyle Orton, who was drafted the following year.\nProfessional career.\nHardwick was picked with the 66th overall selection in the third round of the 2004 NFL draft by the Chargers.\nIn 2004, Hardwick began his career by starting all 14 games he played in when incumbent starter Jason Ball held out due to a contract dispute. During the year, the Chargers ranked sixth in rushing offense and allowed the fourth-fewest sacks in the league.\nIn his second year as a pro, he again started all games he played in as the Chargers ranked in the top ten in rushing offense and in the top half of the league in sacks allowed.\nDuring the 2006 off-season, he agreed to a five-year $17 million contract extension with the Chargers.\nHe then went on to start all 16 games for the first time in his career as the Chargers ranked second in rushing offense and eighth in sacks allowed.\nIn December 2006, Hardwick was named the backup center for the AFC squad in the 2007 Pro Bowl, Jeff Saturday being the starter. He was one of 11 Chargers selected to the Pro Bowl that year.\nIn his fourth season with San Diego, he started 12 games, being forced to miss 4 due to a foot injury.\nIn 2008, Hardwick was inactive for the first three weeks of the season while recovering from an offseason foot injury. He returned to the starting lineup at center in Week 4 to play the remaining 13 games.\nIn 2009, Hardwick suffered an ankle injury so severe that it nearly ended his career. He missed 13 games that season, but returned in time for a late-season push to the playoffs and he hasn’t missed a game since.\n2010 was a comeback year for the center as he was back to his usual form. He started all 16 games for the second time of his career.\nIn 2011, Hardwick played another full season starting every game. He was one of the few players on a crippled offensive line hurt by multiple injuries. After the 2011 season ended, Hardwick became an unrestricted free agent, he had recently become a new father, and he had just watched one of his best friends and linemates, left guard Kris Dielman retire after suffering a serious concussion. All three factors led Hardwick to ponder whether he wanted to continue playing football, and if he did, whether he wanted to play it in San Diego or make a fresh start elsewhere. Hardwick decided to stay in San Diego and finish his career there, opting to sign a new three-year contract with the Chargers, worth $13,500,000.\nIn his 10th year with the Chargers, Hardwick maintained his place at center, starting in all 16 games and earning Chargers' Lineman of the Year honors for the second time in a row. However, quarterback Philip Rivers was sacked 49 times, a career high, due to the offensive line's struggle with injury and poor performance.\nOn September 10, 2014 the Chargers placed Hardwick on injured reserve with a neck injury, ending his season after one game. He announced his retirement on February 2, 2015.\nSerious health concerns played a large part in Hardwick's decision to retire. \"Nerves were getting compressed through various forms. My hands were going numb during training camp for weeks at a time. I was losing feeling in my fingers up through my elbows. I was having a bunch of stingers. On a daily basis, my hands were asleep, my elbows were burning, and I was losing a normalcy to life. It became reckless to continue playing\".\nPersonal life.\nHardwick is married to his college sweetheart Jayme-Lee Biamonte, who played for the Boilermakers women's soccer team and currently serves as the San Diego State Aztecs women's soccer assistant coach. They have two sons."

        "title": "Field hockey stick",
        "text": "In field hockey, each player carries a stick and cannot take part in the game without it. The stick for an adult is usually in the range 89–95 cm (35–38 in) long. A maximum length of 105 cm (41.3\") was stipulated from 2015. The maximum permitted weight is 737 grams. The majority of players use a stick in the range 19 oz to 22 oz (538 g - 623 g). Traditionally hockey sticks were made of hickory, ash or mulberry wood with the head of the sticks being hand carved and therefore required skilled craftsmen to produce. Sticks made of wood continue to be made but the higher grade sticks are now manufactured from composite materials which were first permitted after 1992. These sticks usually contain a combination of fibreglass, aramid fiber and carbon fibre in varying proportions according to the characteristics (flexibility; stiffness; resistance to impact and abrasion) required.\nEarly rules.\nAfter centuries of different variations of field hockey (including a version in England, sometime prior to 1860, in which, because of the very hilly heathland area in which it was played, a rubber cube and not a ball was used), the game became more organised and regularised.\nBy 1886, when an association of clubs was formed and the game became more standardised, the modern game as we know it began (and a white painted cricket ball had become the standard object to play with). The game had also by this time divided into various branches which developed as separate sports. Shinty, a game popular in Scotland, uses both sides of a round stick with a curved end, which is shaped in a similar way to a walking stick; the Irish game, hurling, uses both sides of a stick which is flat on both sides and shaped somewhat like bill-hook with an axe-like handle. Bandy also uses both sides of the stick. It was called \"hockey on ice\" in the beginning, as it was considered an ice variety of hockey. The stick in England, possibly because of the close association with it of cricket players, developed with a stick with just one flat playing side, the left face, below a round grip area—with the use of the right-face side, which is rounded, prohibited—an oddity that had a profound effect on the later development of the hockey stick and of the game itself.\nThere have been only three parts of a hockey stick ever named in the rules: the head, the handle, and the splice. Originally (until 2004) the handle was the part above the bottom end of the splice and the head was the part below the bottom end of the splice. Other terms in common use are \"grip\", which refers to the part of the stick held, particularly that area held with two hands when hitting the ball. Most sticks have a round grip which is covered in a non-slip, sweat absorbent, fabric tape. The handle remains rounded on the reverse, back or right hand-side but becomes gradually flat on the \"face\" side and also becomes wider, changing from a diameter of approximately 30 mm to a flat width of approximately 46 mm (the permitted maximum was 2 in—now 51 mm). This flat area above the curve of the head is generally referred to as the \"shaft\". The head of the stick is generally thought of as the curved part. The right side is called the face, the upturn the \"toe\" and the bend of the head where it joins the shaft the \"heel\". In recent times using the edges of the stick (as well as the face side) to strike at the ball has been permitted and thus \"forehand edge stroke\" and \"reverse edge stroke\" will be found in rule terminology. Forehand and reverse stroke refers to the taking of these strokes, from the right or left hand side of the body respectively, as the stick may be used \"face up\" or \"face down\" to make an edge stroke, the two edges of the stick are not separately named but simply referred to as edges.\nInitially there were six rule requirements applying to the hockey stick:\nDuring the 19th century, field hockey evolved in England. This evolution led to the creation of the Federation Internationale de Hockey (FIH) in 1924.\nContance Applebee is responsible for introducing field hockey to the United States in 1901. The United States Field Hockey Association was formed in 1922.\nIn 1908, men's field hockey was introduced into the Olympic Games. Women's field hockey was first recognized in the Olympic Games in 1980.\nThe World Cup is the crowning achievement in international field hockey. The World Cup is held every four years and 12 men's and 12 women's teams compete for the title of World Champion.\nHead length.\nThe first major developments to what was later termed the \"English style\" stick (and the method of play with such sticks) occurred in India. (The game in its modern form was apparently brought to India by the British Army, although there does not appear to be any specific evidence of this. But certainly hockey was played by the British forces in India.) At that time the stick head was very long (in excess of 12\"—300 mm) and made from an indigenous British timber, ash. The Indians then produced sticks with a much shorter head length and a tighter heel bend and used mulberry, which is tougher than ash, but has similar bending characteristics and weight and is easy to work. This development changed the nature of the game, led to the \"Indian dribble\" and to Indian dominance of the game in the first half of the twentieth century.\nA hockey stick is occasionally used in the vertical position shown, but manipulating the movement and the direction of the ball in a controlled way (dribbling) is carried out in what is termed a \"dribbling crouch\", when the handle of the stick will usually be angled between 35° and 55°. Hitting or pushing the ball can be done with the stick at any angle between the vertical and horizontal and recent changes to the rules allow even the edges of the stick to be used to sweep or strike at the ball on the ground. \nThe various stick head designs can be compared in respect of how, with the handle at an angle of 45°, they differ in the carrying out of the Indian dribble, i.e. controlling the direction of the ball by rotating the stick head over the top/front of the ball rather than (or as well as) around the back of the ball (the English style dribble). The multi-layered stick head diagram indicates the changes in head shape and length that occurred over thirty years or so.\nThe earliest trend was in shortening the stick head. While that reduced the stopping area of the head it was beneficial because, according to the rules at the time, only one side of the stick head could be used (at that time the ball could not be played with the edges of the head or handle but with the flat side or face side only).\nUsing extreme examples is useful as a means of demonstrating effects that occur in less extreme configurations but are much more difficult to spot and therefore to explain. The first observation is an easy one (top left in the image captioned \"Reversed head in various…\"). If the stick head is rotated onto the reverse (lighter colour) the toe is not going to disappear into the ground to enable the reverse side of the stick to be presented to the ball—a vertical adjustment is necessary. Secondly (top right), if the handle of the stick is kept at exactly the same angle and rotated, a horizontal adjustment is necessary to bring the reversed head to a position where contact will be made with the ball. The third figure (bottom left) shows these adjustments having been made (and a change to the angle of the handle because the position of the hand holding the stick at the top would be about the same as it is when gripping the stick in the forehand position), but the area of stick head making contact with the ball is very small; so control may not be adequate. The fourth figure (bottom right) demonstrates that to get good contact with the ball on a larger area of the reversed head, it is necessary to move the handle much nearer to the vertical. This means the player must bring the ball in very close to the feet and come to a more upright dribbling position—this in turn impairs the ability to scan the pitch and keep the ball in peripheral vision at the same time—a considerable disadvantage when dribbling to evade opponents.\nSo, although the long head stick was an adequate shape for a dribbling style which was based on moving the ball forward from directly behind the ball; and changes of direction could be achieved by rotating the stick around the back of the ball and/or moving the feet to either side of the ball, it was not so easy to use the long stick head to bring the ball across the feet and back again, particularly when it was placed wide to the left of the feet of the player. (This left side position was compounded in difficulty with a very severe interpretation of \"obstruction\", which prohibited shielding of the ball from an opponent. The game was also, at the time, seen as \"right-sided\" and positioning the body between the ball and a close or closing opponent, approaching from the right hand side, was not allowed.) Reversed stick hitting, pushing and flicking would be short range skills and difficult to do accurately, if at all, especially when moving at speed.\nGradually over many years stick heads were made shorter and the \"heel\" was made to a tighter bend. This process continued until the \"one piece\" head could not be made to a sharper bend without the timber splitting out on the base. As it was, attempts to have the grain follow entirely the same curve as the bend, as it should for maximum strength (this is why the timber is bent rather than cut to shape) were abandoned by some producers and an upturn to the toe was sometimes achieved by cutting across the wood-grain at the toe end of the head to achieve the desired shape. Some manufacturers resorted to gluing a separate piece of wood on top of the toe or glued additional strips of timber to the inner edge of the handle above the head to get the effect of a tighter heel bend. (\"Head adjustment\" frequently happened to update old style stock or where unmodified presses were in use.).\nSome players were cutting part of the toe off their sticks, to achieve a shorter head, and rounding the end off, (although on the older styles this did nothing to tighten the bend to the heel and often just ruined the stick). Predictably, there were sticks produced for the 1986 World Cup with heads with a horizontal length of only 95 mm. The international players to whom they were handed out tried them and then returned them as unusable.\nThe difficulty was twofold: 1) The toe was so short that it could not be rotated completely over the top circumference of the ball and 2) When the stick head was played around the back of the ball it \"ran off\", because there was insufficient \"run length\" to the stick head. If, for example, a player \"propped\" the ball while moving in a dribbling crouch (putting the stick head over the front of the ball), drew the ball back towards his feet and then took the stick head around the back of the ball to bring it forward again, perhaps moving the ball off in another direction (a common movement), the margin for error was so small that the ball could easily slip off the stick head. The ultra-short stick head was to some extent based on the idea that the new artificial surfaces would lead to a style of hockey based on stopping the ball with the handle of the stick near horizontal to the ground and that dribbling to elude opponents would be almost eliminated with near continuous passing of the ball. Although there was a development of \"system hockey\" that overcame the stick/ball skill deficiencies of the Europeans compared with India and Pakistan at the time, it was not as fluid as the kind of one and two touch passing game common in soccer and that ideal was (and still is) a long way off.\nThe hook.\nIn 1982 a Dutch inventor, Toon Coolen, patented a hockey stick with a \"hook\" head. The hockey stick manufacturers Grays took the design up in 1983 and the first mass-produced hockey sticks, with laminated timber head parts, were manufactured in Pakistan. This new design was possible because of the development of epoxy resin glues that did not require perfectly dry timber for bonding and curing to a strength that could cope with the immense stresses placed on a stick head when a hockey ball is struck with it.\nBy 1993 the \"Hook\" patent, had been ruled (following a court case in Germany) to protect only hook shapes within 20° of the vaguely written \"nearly 180°\" (referring to the degree of upturn of the toe in relation to the shaft of the stick in the patent description; the shaft of the handle being described a being bent through \"nearly 180°\" to form the hook shape of the stick head). That opened the way for the appearance of more J-shaped stick heads and the gradual morphing of the \"midi\" shape with the hook shape. In that year also a patent application, lodged in Pakistan in 1987 by Martin Conlon, for a kinked shaft hockey stick, with a set-back head (which was also hook shaped, but not to \"near 180°\"), was granted after strong opposition in Pakistan. (Indian and UK patents had been granted in 1988, although the same company had also opposed the UK patent application). Conlon designed and imported to the UK the first J-head sticks in 1990 but, prior to the 1993 decision, other distributors and manufacturers had been very reluctant to order made or produce hook style sticks of any sort, because of uncertainty about the strength of the patent that \"ring-fenced\" the hook hockey stick.\nThe \"midi\" head.\nThe death knell of the ultra short head was sounded in 1986, due to the introduction of the midi head shape, produced with a laminating process; although of course many players continued to use \"one-piece\" short head sticks for many years after that date and many thousands more of them were manufactured. The reason for the continued use of the one piece was that the midi length was similar to that of the more popular one piece stick heads that had been around for the previous ten or so years. Some one piece constructions were still being produced on presses on which the central boss had not been modified and the heel bend was \"slower\" than on that of the production of the more aware manufacturers, but the more \"go ahead\" manufacturers were producing a one piece that could compete well with the laminated midi—at least as far as playing functionality was concerned.\nThe biggest casualty of the midi was the patented Hook produced by the same company. It had not taken off in the UK culture of the short-head stick and for a number of years after the midi was introduced the Hook was seen as something of a novelty, even as an indoor stick or a stick exclusively for goalkeepers. In fact versions of it were produced specifically for goalkeepers, with a very extended toe (6 in—150 mm or more) and that development continued until some were made with the toe extending nearly the length of the handle and the FIH stepped in and ruled that the vertical toe limit was in future to be 4 in (100 mm).\nThe hook was 124 mm, measured horizontally across face of the stick head, when the handle was held vertically; the midi was 113 mm; many one piece heads between 110 mm and 115 mm, and the unusable ultra short 94 mm. A difference of only 30 mm between the head length of a stick that was considered cumbersome (although the Hook also had the height of the toe causing a feeling of imbalance) to one that was considered too short to easily play with. There were still many players playing quite happily with a stick with a head length of 7 in (175 mm), but players buying new sticks were now conscious of quite subtle differences in stick feel and performance due to length, shape, and the distribution of head weight—not just the total ounce weight and the \"swing weight or balance\" of the stick—and for the first time, in the years after 1986, were being offered a wide range of hockey sticks from a greatly increased number of manufacturers, from which to choose what suited them. After the arrival of the laminations, some brands were offering as many as ten different shapes or styles of stick head on the traditional shaft. The arrival of composites would complicate the picture further.\nIn the early 1990s there were an astonishing number and variety of hockey sticks on offer compared with what had been available ten years earlier. By 1992, hockey stick reinforcement was a big issue and composites had been accepted into an (extended) FIH experimental trial period (there was a great deal of concern about the power generated by these new reinforcements and the safety of players). There were also hockey sticks with metal handles and inserted plywood heads (made by the American company Eastons, better known for making baseball bats), as well as the wide range of one piece head sticks still produced and an expanding range of laminated midi and laminated shorties. The metal handled sticks were later banned for \"safety reasons\", in what was widely regarded as a political move by the FIH.\nHeel bend, ball position, hitting &amp; stopping.\nIt may be noted from the diagram above that no matter how \"tight\" the heel bend, reversing the stick head over the ball, with a \"traditional\" style hockey stick head, always requires both a vertical and horizontal adjustment of the stick head position. This is not anywhere near as difficult as it was with the very long head stick and this sort of adjustment will be almost sub-conscious in an experienced player. Note too, that when the shaft is held vertically, the ball is more securely stopped, when on the ground, to the toe side of the shaft rather than in the middle of the shaft. Novice players frequently assume that the centre of the ball will align with the centre of the shaft when stopping the ball in this way and as a result, the ball deflects off to the heel side and usually into their feet. Because of the heel slope on the stick head the vertical shaft stop is actually much easier to carry out securely (when the ball is on the ground) if the handle is held at least 10° off the vertical, with the top of the handle sloped to the player's left. When the ball in the air, a little off the ground, below knee height for example, is often easier to catch the ball correctly if the handle is vertical.\nOne of the incidental effects of the tighter heel bend of the modern stick is an increase in playing reach with the optimum striking or stopping part of the head of the stick when used in the normal range of playing angles. Held parallel the distance between the curve of the base of the stick head and the top of the handle is the same in the two sticks illustrated. At an angle of 45°, as shown, there is a difference of approximately 3 cm.\nThe positioning of the ball mid-face on the stick head of the modern stick, compared with the mid-face position on the longer stick, also brings the middle of the ball much closer to a line projected through the centre of the handle and the circumference closer to the back edge of the stick, enabling better close control of the ball.\nIt will be appreciated after a glance at the illustration of the 'English' style hockey stick that stopping a ball on the ground with the handle held vertically would not be easy. If the ball is lined up centrally with the centre of the handle (red) it would be likely to deflect off the heel side of the head. Even with the ball positioned central to the head (blue) stopping would not have been very secure with an upright handle. Presenting the stick at an angle of 35° or more (40° in the illustration) solves the problem of the ball running off the head by presenting a very long area behind the ball (relative to the width of the ball) but presents the problem of the best or optimum position to stop the ball for the following action. For hitting the optimum positions seems to be where a line projected through the leading edge of the shaft of the handle passes through the centre of the ball because it is the position closest to the centre line of the handle where the entire width of the head is behind the ball. Stopping the ball closer to the toe of the stick is acceptable but not optimal, as adjustment, which takes time, is necessary before the next intended action. In the modern stick the vertical handle position is still not as secure as an angled presentation of the handle but the angle now can be considerably less, because of the tighter heel bend and the stopping and hitting positions of the ball are easier to determine. The line of the leading edge of the handle still projects close to the center of the ball when the angle of the stick handle is in the 30°–50° range and a line through the centre of the handle will project to the back and underside of the ball.\nSet-back heads, ball position &amp; stopping.\nThe illustration called 'Stopping and Hitting' shows that when a vertical stick shaft is aligned to the centre of the ball part of the ball protrudes to the heel side, this would happen even if the heel was not a bend but a 90° corner and the only way to cover the entire ball with the shaft held vertical is to use a set-back head—that is a head that is set-back to the heel side of the shaft.\nA stick with a set-back head and toe-side protrusion, with the handle positioned vertically, covers substantially more of the ball and can reduce off heel deflection errors in stopping. Using the set-back head in the more comfortable or natural stopping angle puts a vertical area of shaft above the ball while at the same time aligning centre ball and a line projected through the centre of the handle.\nIn the upright hitting position, which is generally between 15° and 25° off vertical, the heel bend of the Indian stick of the 1970s will cover the whole ball. As the heel bend gets tighter in the 1980s and 1990s the ball is controlled closer to the centre line of the stick but it is not until the setback stick appears that the centre of the shaft is aligned (or nearly so) with the centre of the ball. The ball appears to move back along the length of the various stick heads as the heads become shorter and the heel tighter, in fact the playing position of the ball is moved further and further from the feet as playing reach is increased.\nThere are presently two styles of outfield set-back stick, the degree of setback to the head is a feature they have in common; they differ in that one has a 'kink' or shaft protrusion on the toe side above the head of the stick while the other does not. In the goalkeeper versions some also have the toe of the head cut flat (parallel to the handle) rather than rounded to allow the user to present the stick closer to the ground when stopping in a horizontal position on the reverse side, this is to more easily prevent the ball from going under the handle of the stick.\nThe modern hook.\nIn the mid-90s the \"hook\" head style hockey stick was relaunched, this time by the former German U21 International player Thomas Kille. Bright colours, bold graphics and painted heads were introduced. Manufacturers became much more aware of the look of their products and hockey sticks sold, particularly to new players, as much on colour and fashion as strength and usability.\nToday, across many brands, there is a choice of angle of hook upturn, 45°, 60°, and 75°. A style of stick that almost no-one in Europe wanted to use in 1987, is today used almost universally; it is difficult now to find a player who is not using a hook style hockey stick and many of them have never used the \"shortie\" style at all; just as many of the players of today have never played hockey on a natural grass pitch—the development of artificial surfaces has also had a significant effect on the ways in which hockey sticks are used.\nThe original version, the 'Hook' relied on a patent description that put the inner side edge of the toe parallel (or nearly so) to the facing edge of the handle. The vertical height of the toe was approximately 80 mm (dotted line) Fig.1 and it was of almost uniform thickness with the remainder of the stick head.\nEarly modification Fig. 1. reduced the horizontal head length to approximate 115 mm and the 'toe height' to approximately 75 mm. A hockey ball is between about 71 mm and 75 mm in diameter (224–235 mm in circumference)—so that put the 'toe height' at the same height as the maximum height of the ball. This is a common feature across hook head designs today, the toe generally varies in height, between the minimum and maximum height of the ball, when the handle is in a vertical position.\nThe next development was a hook with a toe with an inner edge that sloped away from the handle by approximately 30° (a 60° angle to the ground or a 150° 'upturn'. The 'toe height' was 75 mm. (Modern versions Fig. 2 vary between 70 mm and 75 mm. in toe height.) The horizontal length of the head was based on the length of the 'standard' one-piece short-head stick, approximately 110 mm. and modern versions seem to vary between 110 mm and 115 mm. The mid-90s saw the introduction of the more 'open' hooks Fig. 3, some at 45° and a significant increase in horizontal head length, some as much as 120 mm.\nNew names have been coined to describe the various hook shapes but there is much confusion and overlapping of names. 'Maxi' and 'Mega' are also terms for styles of hook shape but there is no common agreement about what these terms mean outside of each 'brand' name that employs them: what one brand terms a midi another calls a 'hook' but, basically, there are three types of hook. The near symmetrical 'U', a 'tight' or 'closed' toe shape, between 60° and 75° and an 'open' shape of 45°–55°. Where the toe is shorter the same toe angles are generally referred to as midi.\nSet-back stick heads.\nThe big headed 'Hook' also suffered for a short time from the appearance at the 1986 World Cup of the first sticks with set-back heads. There was not a significant impact but it (and others) added to the general confusion, as apparently 'everyone and his dog' were presenting new ideas in head shape. (Metal handled and fully composite sticks had not yet made an appearance so at the time the 'battle' was about head shape and length rather than materials and to a lesser extent, because hockey players at the time tended to be more 'traditionalist', the head/handle configuration. Even reinforcement with fiberglass and carbon fibre was not the issue it was later to become.\nOne hockey stick produced by AREC for the French inventor, Jean Capét, had the centre of the handle aligned with the centre of the horizontal length of the head. There was a lot of promotion based on 'rotational balance' and the 'sweet spot' and 'power hitting'. The 'Hook' certainly felt out of rotational balance, especially to those who had been playing with short-head sticks that had been made with a very thin toe, so as to concentrate the weight of the head closer to the shaft.\nAligning the centre of the handle with the centre of the horizontal length of a short-head, rather than with the centre of the ball created some unusual playing characteristics, for example, the reversed-stick ball position being further from the feet than the forehand ball position, which is the opposite of what happens with a conventional 'traditional' handle head configuration. (When the centre line of the handle aligns with the centre of the ball—or very nearly so—there is no or very little difference in ball position in relation to the stick or the feet of the player between the forehand and reverse playing positions.)\nThe AREC stick was initially produced without a significantly upturned toe and had a short horizontal length (approximately 105 mm), it was in this regard similar to standard short-head sticks of the time. The lack of an upturned toe, combined with the unusual reverse ball position, caused some difficulty in adapting to the stick and when the horizontal head lengths of sticks began to be made longer, by popular demand. A stick with the handle aligned to the centre of the head length was no longer practical for playing hockey. Manufacture of it as an outfield stick ceased in the early 1990s, probably by 1992 but similar sticks, by other manufacturers, have appeared for goalkeeper use.\nKinked-shaft &amp; recurve heads.\nThe traditional small arc to the heel edge of the hockey stick had the effect of setting the stick head back slightly. This aspect of stick design (of which the AREC hockey stick was an extreme example) was first explored just prior to the Men's Hockey World Cup of 1986 and resulted in the production of hockey sticks with a stick head considerably more set-back in relation to the handle. The original design, aligning the centre line of the handle with the centre of the ball, in the common striking position, featured a counterbalancing \"kink\" or protrusion to the handle on the toe edge of the handle, just above the head of the stick. This invention of the kinked-shaft and set-back head stick led directly to rules governing the amount of bend or \"permitted deviation\" to the \"edge sides\" of the hockey stick handle. Some of these were later termed \"recurve\" heads (a description given to a later style, produced by an Australian manufacturer, without the patented kink feature.)\nThe early extremes in stick design were in those sticks intended for use by goalkeepers. The aim was simply to present the maximum stopping area to the ball. The first was the extended hook (far left), which was made with a toe of approximately 150 mm (6 in). When sticks with an upturn substantially more than that (some more than half the length of the handle) began to appear, which was around 1988, the FIH placed a limit of 100 mm (4\") on the upturn of the toe of the head.\nIn 1990 a plywood cutout of a stick with multiple kinks in the shaft was presented to the FIH for comment, the intention was to produce it as a goalkeeper's stick. Having limited the toe upturn only two years previously the FIH saw this as mockery and issued a press release, in April 1990, proposing a ban on all hockey sticks with \"non-straight\" handles to take effect after the Barcelona Olympics of that year. There was protest from those who had been marketing sticks with set-back heads and or kinked shafts and it was in any case not a sensible proposal because there is no such thing as a hockey stick with a perfectly straight handle. The result was the withdrawal of the proposed ban and the imposition of \"limits of deviation\", which permitted one bend to either side of the handle to a maximum of 20 mm on each side. In 2000 a diagram explaining the permitted deviation was included in the Rules of Hockey. Previously the only restraint on the configuration of a hockey stick was that it had to pass through a ring of 2\" diameter (later adjusted to 51 mm—2 in rounded up to the nearest millimeter).\nPermitted deviation.\nAlthough permitted deviation (from the straight) to the edges of a hockey stick (handle) were included in the 1991 Rules of Hockey, a diagram of a hockey stick, to illustrate what was permitted was not included until 2000 and then it was a part stick diagram placed horizontally on a page smaller than the A6 page of the present rulebook. The diagram was very poorly drawn but it was a significant step for the FIH to include it at all. The diagram remained unchanged until 2004, when the orientation was altered so that the stick was shown upright and it was also shown full length. The x-axis (previously vertical) became the ground plane and the y-axis a vertical line through the centre of the handle. Further improvements to the diagram (particularly the drawing of the representation of the stick and an illustration of possible curves to the handle) were made in 2006 and a second diagram, detailing head configuration, was added.\nTo describe the dimensions of head and handle the hockey stick is envisaged to be placed with the bottom curve of the stick head on a level surface, the x-axis, with the stick-handle perpendicular to it (the y-axis). The y-axis runs from an intersection with the x-axis (0) vertically through the midpoint of the top of the handle. The Head is the part from the x-axis to the line C-C (diagram) a vertical distance of 100 mm. This line C-C also describes the limit on any upturn to the toe of the head. By Rule there is no limit to the length of the stick head along the x-axis, but practical considerations, as well as technicalities related to the joining of the head and the Handle (on the line C-C), did create limitations with wooden sticks.\nThe extent of the stick head along the X+ axis, towards the 'heel' of the Head is confined by the rule requirement that the stick head and the handle meet in a smooth continuous fashion at the line C-C and by a rule restriction on the shape of the handle, which is that the stick-handle must not project beyond the line B1-B1. It is possible to envisage a stick where the width of handle did not extend beyond the line A1-A1, thus allowing a significant extension of the stick head along the X+ axis, but the practicalities of such a design seem to be limited and have not been explored. The length of the Head (or toe) along the X- axis has varied enormously, especially since the Second World War and again after the introduction of the timber lamination process in the early 1980s.\nThe stick handle may be bent or 'deviated', in a smooth curve only, once only to either side. That is the handle may have one out-moving curve on the 'heel' side of the head and one out-moving curve on the toe side. It is therefore possible to have a hockey stick with a handle deviation to the front or toe side or a handle deviation to the back or 'heel' side or a stick-handle that is bent once to both the toe and 'heel' sides.\nThe sample diagram on the right shows three deviating areas (a), (b), and (c). Any of these areas could exist on a stick by itself but, in this illustration, area (a) could legally coexist with area (b) and area (c) could coexist with area (b); but areas (a) and (c) could not legally coexist on the same stick because they are both on the same edge and only one protrusion either beyond the line AA or beyond the line A1A1—or both—is permitted on the handle.\nThe maximum permitted width of the handle (51 mm) is illustrated in the diagram by the distance between the dotted lines A-A and A1-A1. A hockey stick handle will rarely be of the maximum permitted width: most are between 46 mm and 48 mm at the widest point.\n The maximum permitted 'deviation' is shown by the lines B-B and B1-B1 respectively. The line B-B is 20 mm further along the X- axis than the line A-A and the line B1-B1 is 20 mm further along the X+ axis than the line A1-A1. There is no limit to the length of a protrusion along the y-axis specified, so the deviation curve or curves may be of any length along the length of the stick-handle. Some goalkeeping sticks have an outward curve on the toe side (within the line B-B) that extends for almost half the total length of the stick.\nThe sample illustrated does not reach the line A1A1 on the 'heel edge' and the Y axis is not central to the shaft, which raises the question \"How is the stick positioned for measurement of permitted deviation.\" The answer is that the vertical axis Y runs through the top centre of the handle and the stick is assumed to be suspended from that top centre point and perpendicular to the X axis (the ground), the curve to the base of the head of the stick being in contact with the ground, it is therefore not necessary for the Y axis to pass through the centre of the shaft just above the head of the stick, although in most traditional sticks it will do so (or very nearly do so—as 'rake' to the handle may cause the Y axis to run a few millimeters to the heel side of the true centre of the shaft). To October 2015 no official measuring method or device for measuring 'permitted deviation' has been approved by the FIH.\nPermitted bow.\nIncreasing the degree of bow to the face side (flat side) makes it easier to get high speeds from the drag-flick (a \"sling-shot\" style stroke started from behind the body of the flicker) and allows easier execution of the stroke. At first, after extreme bows were introduced (2005), the Hockey Rules Board (HRB) placed a limit of 50 mm on the maximum depth of such a bow over the length of the stick, but experience quickly demonstrated this degree of bend to be excessive.\nThe Rules of Hockey 2006 limited this particular curve of the stick to 25 mm so as to limit the power with which the ball can be flicked and to try to ensure that hitting control was maintained (the curvature to the face of the stick considerably influences the angle at which the stick head strikes through the ball). The placement of the maximum bow along the length of handle has now been specified in the Rules of Hockey at 20 cm above the head (the line C-C). \nIt is now illegal for any hockey stick to have a bow that exceeds 25 mm. The bow height is measured by placing the stick face-side to a flat surface and presenting the official measuring device, a 25 mm-high metal triangular or cylindrical measure, to the gap between the surface and the under-flat of the stick.\nSince this article was first written in 2008, there have been attempts to get around the rule by the production of a stick which 'in a natural resting position' has a face side that is not parallel to the flat surface measured from but rests with the face at a sharp angle. The result of the sloping of the face side is to put one edge of it closer than 25 mm to the flat surface and permit a much deeper bow than would otherwise be possible. This flouts the intention of the rule, so it is possible that there may be a move to a measuring cylinder, under and across, the entire face of the stick.\nThere was a development in design called the 'low bow'. This placed the maximum bow of the stick much closer to the head than was previously the case, when it was positioned more centrally on the length of the stick. The effect of placing the maximum bow lower down the handle was to increase the angle at which the stick head was presented to the ball. The angle of presentation of a '25 mm low bow' was approximately the same as was achieved when the maximum permitted bow was 50 mm but the maximum was situated at about the mid-length of the stick.\nExtreme bow has an effect on the ease with which stick-work and hitting of the ball (so that it stays on the ground) may be carried out. There has always been some bow to a stick handle, 10–20 mm was common (right in diagram) because to have a stick that was straight would make 'gathering' the ball, by pulling it towards the body from the left, more difficult and a bow in the other direction (a convex bow) would cause 'dragging' in stick-work and make hitting the ball cleanly difficult in the other.\nA stick with a very small degree of bow (no more than 5 mm) was popular in the days when the clip hit in the outfield was a permitted stroke (a chip hit is a hit down on the top or back of the ball which causes it to rise sharply and produces under-spin, so that the ball does not run on when it lands). The increased use of the scoop when the lifted hit in the outfield was banned led to an increase in bow depth (and many players also found that a moderate bow aided stick-work as well). The maximum depth of this bow was generally at around the mid-length of the stick.\nThe 'low bow' has been popularized by the development of the drag-flick, particularly as a first shot on goal at a penalty corner. The Pakistan International player Sohail Abbas, who holds the record for the number of goals scored at international level, mostly scored with the set piece drag-flick, had such a stick made especially to his own requirements and many have copied his design—and tried to improve on it.\nAlthough there can be no doubt that the 'slingshot' effect of a bowed stick, when the ball is 'dragged' from the rear of the feet and released after powerful body and arm rotation to the front of the feet, has dramatically increased the velocity at which the ball may be propelled by this flicking method, there may be considerable difficulty in hitting the ball along the ground with a very bowed stick. This may be of advantage when shooting at the goal with a lifted hit from within the 'circle' (which is legal) but a disadvantage when hitting the ball outside of the scoring 'circles', because it is illegal to intentionally lift the ball with a hit except when within the scoring 'circles' i.e. the opponent's 'circle'.\nThe upright forehand hitting stroke, which is commonly used when the ball is close to the feet, will seldom be made with the handle in the same plane as the ball, unless the ball is to the immediate right of the player i.e. beside or alongside his feet. (Stick shown on far right of illustration)—which is generally the case when the ball is being hit directly to the front or from left to right—with a bowed stick even this vertical handle position will present an angled head to the ball. The further away to the front of the player the ball is the greater will be the head angle presented to the ball. To deal with the problem of head presentation some players use a low 'roundhouse' style of hitting, rather than an upright style and may also employ sweep-hits or slap-hitting of the ball (the difference being the positioning of the hands, sweep hits are generally made with the hands together at the top of the stick and with the base of the stick head in contact with the ground, while slap-hits are usually made with the hands in the more spread dribbling grip and the stick head is not necessarily in contact with the ground, but it may be), either sweep or slap type strokes give greater control over the angle of the face of the stick as it makes contact with the ball and are often the preferred strokes when passing the ball over longer distances (over shorter distances—less than 20 m—a push stroke is often preferred).\nThe detail illustration shows that when the handle is angled away from the ball both the position of contact with the ball on the ball and the part of the face of the stick making contact will be altered. The greater the bow the greater the degree of adjustment the player must make to his swing and to the hitting position of the ball to achieve a hit flat along the ground.\nStages of development.\nThe development of the modern hockey stick has not taken place in one continuous flow with each development following on from a previous one. Many things changed in the same time frame but at different speeds, especially some of the later developments. There have been more changes in stick design in the last twenty-five years than there were in the previous one hundred and twenty-five and the pace of change has been an ever increasing one. There will no doubt be further development, probably in materials, possibly because of changes to the rules. In roughly chronological order this is what has happened so far.\nThe forehand striking position.\nFor the purposes of this article the ball will be assumed to be 73 mm in diameter. Ball size does play a significant part in stickwork and ball control (as does the weight and hardness of the ball) but an investigation of these is outside the scope of this article. The width of stick handles does vary (as does the horizontal length of stick heads) but for clarity and convenience the shaft of the handle just above the head has been taken as 46 mm, which is fairly common, and the sticks scaled from that measurement.\nThe position of the ball when it is played, particularly hit with the stick head, does, however have a bearing on stick head design. Using just one of the whole range of angles the ball may be struck at from the forehand (right-hand) side (45°), the position of the ball will be looked at in relation to both the centre of the head of the stick and a line projected to run through the centre of the handle. An examination on the position of wear on the base of stick heads that have been used over a period on an abrasive playing surface lead to the conclusion that the ball is positioned close to the center of the head length of the modern stick. This is also the more usual position for receiving or stopping the ball in play while in the 'dribbling crouch'. Obviously when the handle is vertical or horizontal there is considerable variation but in most common hitting and dribbling positions the line of the uppermost edge of the handle projects close to the centre of the ball.\nOne of the problems with a striking head that is significantly narrower than the diameter of the ball is that the ball is easily lifted unintentionally if struck with the face of the stick head inclined backward, 'open', rather than vertical or nearly so. Striking the ball with a 'closed' face is not always a solution, because it is then possible to 'squeeze' or 'clip' it, again causing the ball to rise, possibly even more steeply than with the so-called 'undercut' hit.\nAnother difficulty is striking the ball accurately at the point on the stick head that is intended (the usual range of error can be seen, in the diagram, in the difference of the lengths of the red lines that run from the centre of the two differently positioned stick heads).\nIt is also necessary to avoid unintentionally turning the handle during a hit at the ball so that the ball is \"sliced\" (to the right) or hooked (to the left), this is achieved by gripping the stick firmly, generally with one hand locked against the other at the top of the handle, at the moment of impact with the ball.\nEnsuring vertical and flat (perpendicular to intended direction of ball travel) contact with the ball is in the hands of the player and the coach, but achieving a correct contact position between the stick head and the ball can be helped by the design of the stick.\nAt a common playing angle three different styles of hook stick head present identical ball/handle relationships because the bend of the 'heel' is the same in each stick. An increase in the height of the toe over the ball is very noticeable and is most pronounced in the more 'open' shape. The modern hook does not suffer from the effects of a rotational imbalance in the head as much as the original did because stick heads are now generally tapered towards the toe, rather than of uniform thickness so toe height is not, from a weight and rotational balance point of view, as much of an issue as it once might have been. The stick head is also generally tapered from the midpoint of the striking area towards the bottom curve, so when the stick is in the reversed position the maximum thickness of the head is not at the highest point. This gives a more balanced rotation of the weight of the stick head over the ball.\nSome of the early hooks were actually thinner in the centre and became thicker in the toe; it is likely that this was done to facilitate more powerful reversed-stick hitting of the ball but it gave the stick unusual handling characteristics when turning it over the ball and back in \"stickwork\": an \"overturning\" or \"throw\" of the stick head had to be taken into account. The composite stick is generally lighter than the previous wood versions and it is unusual these days to find a young player using the 25–26 oz sticks that were quite commonly used on grass in the 1970s, especially by those likely to be regularly taking hits at a stationary ball.\nField hockey stick brands.\nThe majority of modern hockey sticks are manufactured in Asia (Pakistan, India, and China predominantly). Manufacturers will often produce sticks for a number of different brands."

        "text": "Joseph Walton Haynes (September 21, 1917 – January 6, 1967) was an American professional baseball player, coach and front office executive. A right-handed pitcher, he logged 14 seasons in Major League Baseball as a member of the Washington Senators (1939–40; 1949–52) and Chicago White Sox (1941–48). He married Thelma Mae Robertson Griffith, niece of Washington owner Clark Griffith, in October 1941, ten months after he had been traded to Chicago by his fiancée's uncle.\nPitching career.\nBorn in Lincolnton, Georgia, Haynes stood tall and weighed .\nIn 379 big-league games pitched, including 147 games started, Haynes compiled a 76–82 win-loss record, 53 complete games, five shutouts, 159 games finished and 21 saves in 1,581 innings pitched. He allowed 1,672 hits, 823 runs, 704 earned runs, 95 home runs and 620 walks, with 475 strikeouts, 26 hit batsmen, 35 wild pitches, 6,890 batters faced, four balks and a 4.01 ERA.\nHaynes was an above average hitting pitcher, posting a career .213 batting average (111-for-521) with 48 runs, 1 home run and 39 RBI. Defensively, he was better than average, recording a .966 fielding percentage which was 9 points higher than the league average at his position.\nHe began his pro career in 1937, and made his MLB debut on April 24, 1939, at Fenway Park. Coming into the game in the eighth inning with one out and Washington leading the Boston Red Sox 9–7, he allowed Boston to tie the score in the bottom of the ninth, but held the Red Sox off the scoreboard in the tenth after the Senators had forged ahead in the top of that frame. Haynes was credited with the 10–9 triumph in his first major-league appearance.\nAfter two years with Washington, however, Haynes sported a poor 11–18 record and 5.67 earned-run average. Senators owner Griffith sold Haynes' contract to the Chicago White Sox on January 4, 1941.\nOf Haynes' 379 MLB appearances, 218 came with the White Sox, where he won 55 of 98 decisions (.561) and posted a solid 3.14 ERA. He was named to the American League All-Star team (although he did not appear in the game itself) and led the league in games pitched (40) and games finished (35) in and in earned run average (2.42) in .\nHe was reacquired by Washington after the 1948 season, but was ineffective, going only 10–21 with a 5.42 ERA in 112 games in his second stint with the Senators, which ended on October 7, 1952, when he was released.\nCoach and executive.\nAs a member of the Griffith family whose wife inherited 26 percent of the franchise's stock in 1955, Haynes remained in the Washington organization after his playing career ended.\nHe served as the Senators' pitching coach from 1953–55, coached in their farm system, then moved into the front office as executive vice president, working with his brother-in-law, club president Calvin Griffith, in Washington and after the team moved to Minneapolis–St. Paul as the Minnesota Twins in 1961. Haynes died in Hopkins, Minnesota, of a heart attack suffered while shoveling snow at the age of 49."

        "text": "Elmer John Smith (September 21, 1892 – August 3, 1984) was an American professional baseball outfielder who played in Major League Baseball for the Cleveland Indians (1914–16, 1917 and 1919–21), Washington Senators (1916–17), Boston Red Sox (1922), New York Yankees (1922–23), and Cincinnati Reds (1925).\nSmith was a member of the 1920 World Series champions with Cleveland and the 1923 World Series champions with New York. He hit a grand slam in Game 5 of the 1920 World Series, which was the first in World Series history.\nEarly life.\nSmith was born in Sandusky, Ohio. His family moved to Milan, Ohio, when he was two years old. He had five siblings. Smith played baseball, football, and basketball in high school as well as for semi-professional sports teams near Milan.\nCareer.\nEarly career (1911–1917).\nSmith made his professional baseball debut with the Adrian Yeggs of the Class C Southern Michigan League in 1911, and returned to Adrian for the 1912 season. He began the 1913 season with the Duluth White Sox of the Class C Northern League.\nThe Cleveland Naps purchased Smith from Duluth in July 1913. He finished the 1913 season with the Toledo Mud Hens of the Class AA American Association. Smith began the 1914 season with the Waterbury Contenders of the Class B Eastern Association, and made his major league debut with Cleveland, now known as the Indians, on September 20, 1914. He had a .321 batting average in 13 games played.\nIn 1915, Smith competed with Nemo Leibold to be the starting centerfielder for Cleveland. Leibold won the job, but Smith forced his way into Cleveland's batting lineup, with Shoeless Joe Jackson moving from right field to first base. The acquisition of Braggo Roth reduced Smith's playing time during the 1916 season. On August 18, 1916, Cleveland traded Smith and Joe Leonard to the Washington Senators for Joe Boehling and Danny Moeller. In 1917, Smith became a bench player, as the Senators started Clyde Milan, Sam Rice, and Mike Menosky in the outfield.\nPeak years (1917–1923).\nOn June 13, 1917. Cleveland purchased Smith from Washington for $4,000 ($ in current dollar terms). He finished the 1917 season as a bench player. Smith did not play during the 1918 season, as he served as a sergeant in the United States Army. Before the 1919 season, the Indians traded Roth, and Smith reclaimed a starting position in their outfield. In 1920, he batted .316, with 12 home runs and 103 RBIs, which were the 10th-most in baseball. Smith batted .308 with one home run in the 1920 World Series. In the first inning of Game 5, Smith hit a grand slam off of Burleigh Grimes; it was the first grand slam in World Series history. Cleveland won the game and the series. On September 4 and 5, 1921, Smith recorded extra base hits in seven consecutive at bats, setting a new major league record. Earl Sheely broke the record with eight consecutive extra base hits in 1926.\nAfter the 1921 season, Cleveland traded Smith, George Burns, and Joe Harris to the Boston Red Sox for Stuffy McInnis. Starting the 1922 season with Boston, Smith batted .286 in 73 games. On July 23, 1922, the Red Sox traded Smith and Joe Dugan to the New York Yankees for Chick Fewster, Elmer Miller, Johnny Mitchell, a player to be named later and $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms). Smith became a bench player for the Yankees, pinch hitting for Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel. The Yankees won the American League pennant in 1922, but lost the 1922 World Series to the New York Giants; Smith batted 0-for-2 with two strikeouts in the series. He was a member of the 1923 World Series champions, as the Yankees defeated the Giants, though he did not play in the series.\nLater career (1924–1932).\nOn January 7, 1924, the Yankees traded Smith, a player to be named later, along with $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) to the Louisville Colonels for Earle Combs In 1924, Smith hit .334 with 28 home runs for Louisville. The Cincinnati Reds acquired Smith from Louisville before the 1925 season. Smith played in 96 games for Cincinnati and tied with Edd Roush for the team lead for home runs with eight.\nAfter the 1925 season, the Reds sold Smith to the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League (PCL). Smith led the PCL in home runs with 46 in 1926 and with 40 in 1927. He played for Portland into the 1928 season, when they sold him to the Hollywood Stars in September 1928. After the 1928 season, the Stars sold Smith to Louisville. Smith played for Louisville in 1929. He began the 1930 season with the Buffalo Bisons of the International League, and in May was traded to the Minneapolis Millers of the American Association for Hack Miller. He opened the 1931 season with Minneapolis, but was released in April. In May, he played for the New Orleans Pelicans of the Southern Association, and he joined the Springfield Senators in the Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League in June. Smith played for the Fort Wayne Chiefs of the Central League in 1932.\nIn his major league career, Smith had a .276 batting average, 70 home runs, and 540 RBIs.\nPersonal life.\nSmith married Ruth (née Hanrath) in 1921.\nAfter his baseball career, Smith worked for the Cleveland Trencher Company, an engineering firm, until 1959. He and his wife retired to Shaker Heights, Ohio, her hometown. They moved to Columbia, Kentucky, in the 1970s.\nSmith died in Columbia on August 3, 1984, at age 91.\nIn 2011, Smith was inducted into the PCL Hall of Fame."

        "title": "Sailing hydrofoil",
        "text": "A sailing hydrofoil, hydrofoil sailboat, or hydrosail is a sailboat with wing-like foils mounted under the hull. As the craft increases its speed the hydrofoils lift the hull up and out of the water, greatly reducing wetted area, resulting in decreased drag and increased speed. A sailing hydrofoil can achieve speeds exceeding double and in some cases triple the wind speed.\nBoth monohull and multihull sailboats can be retrofitted with hydrofoils, although greater stability can be achieved by using the wider planform of a catamaran or trimaran.\nTypical configurations.\nSome multihulls use three foils; two main forward foils provide lift so that the boat \"flies\" while a horizontal foil on the rudder is trimmed to drive and control altitude. On catamarans, a single main foil can be attached between the hulls just in front of the center of gravity and at 2 degrees of incidence, spanning the tunnel with supporting struts. Hydrofoil catamarans are also called foilcats.\nMultihull sailboats can also employ hydrofoils only to assist performance. Just as daggerboards and rudders are foils that enhance the control of a boat, assisting hydrofoils provide lift to the hull to reduce the wetted area without actually lifting the boat completely out of the water.\nMonohull boats typically employ a \"ladder\" arrangement of hydrofoils splayed out with a dihedral angle of 50 degrees, with a stabilizing rudder foil. One of the earliest examples is the \"Monitor\" boat from 1957. This design offers the advantages of maximum lifting foil area at slow speeds and less at higher speeds, but with some additional drag arising from the dihedral support of the outboard ladder foils.\nTypes of hydrofoils.\nThere are 4 main types of hydrofoils used in sailboats, in which each type employ similar and different advantages to each other. Overall, 'T' Foils fit into their own category of single direction lift, while 'C', 'L', and 'S' fit into a category of multidirectional lift.\n'T' Foils.\n'T' Foils, commonly seen in the International Moth class and the AC75 class, contains a vertical component connecting to a horizontal wing, providing lift for the foil. 'T' Foils only provide lift in the perpendicular direction from the horizontal wing component and hence are typically used only for upwards lift instead providing lift in the vertical and horizontal direction. 'T' Foils are often equipped with an adjustable trailing edge that attaches to some flight control sensor to ensure steady flight. This system was easily implemented in the Moth class.\n'C' Foils.\n'C' Foils also known as curved daggerboards are shaped as a constant curve and are allowed to travel up and down within its casing, changing the area of the board exposed to the water. When the board starts at its maximum height above the water, it is near vertical and employs a lifting force normal to the exposed surface or otherwise horizontal lift. As the board is pushed lower, the 'C' shape forces a larger portion of the board to become horizontal, introducing a larger vertical component in the lift. This variation in configuration allows for many boats to provide a higher upwind angle due to the horizontal lift in combination to the vertical lift. The curved boards also solve the issue of increased drag at high speed, while no longer requiring a strong horizontal lift by adjusting the exposure of the board to the water.\n'S' Foils.\nThe 'S' Foil contains the slight shape of a 's' and operates in a similar manner to the 'C' Foils, with the reverse order of operations, such that when lowering the 'S' Foil the horizontal lifting force exerted increases due to a more vertical orientation in the board.\n'L' Foils.\n'L' Foils consist of a curve edge followed by a sharp 90 degree bend such that the bottom of the foil sits upright when not submerged in the water, and sits at a 45 degree angle from horizontal when submerged entirely. Similarly to the 'C' and 'S' foils, the amount that the foil is lowered changes the amount of vertical and horizontal lift being created.\nFoiling classes.\nMonohulls.\nInternational Moth.\nThe most widespread use of hydrofoils in sailboats to date has been in the International Moth class. Andy Paterson of Bloodaxe boats on the Isle of Wight is widely considered to have developed the first functional foiling Moth, though his boat had three foils in a tripod arrangement. Brett Burvill sailed a narrow skiff Moth with inclined surface-piercing hydrofoils to a race win at the Moth World Championships in 2001 in Australia, which was the first time a hydrofoil Moth had won a race at a World Championship. This hydrofoil configuration was later declared illegal by the class, as it was felt to constitute a multihull, which is prohibited by class rules. Initially Ian Ward in Sydney, Australia developed the first centerline foiling Moth which demonstrated that sailing on centerboard and rudder foils alone was feasible. Subsequently, Garth and John Ilett in Perth, Australia developed a two-hydrofoil system for the Moth with active flap control for the main foil via a surface sensor. John's company Fastacraft was the first to produce a commercially available hydrofoil International Moth. Fasta Craft's Prowler design, superseded in 2008 by the F-Zero, features a carbon-fiber hull, inverted \"T\" foils on the centerboard and rudder, and can reach speeds of over 27 knots. Fasta Craft has since been joined in producing hydrofoil Moths by several other companies, including Bladerider, Assassin, Exocet, and Aardvark Technologies.\nAlthough initially debated fiercely within the class, the adoption of hydrofoils has proven a success for the International Moth class, with rapid fleet growth in the years since 2001. All World Championships since 2004 have been won by hydrofoil-equipped Moths, which can become foilborne in as little as six knots of breeze when steered by an experienced sailor of lighter weight. The class rule remains open to development of all boat components including hydrofoil systems, and development within the class continues to be spurred by both commercial and individual/amateur efforts.\nWaszp.\nThe Waszp class founded in 2016, is almost identical to the current configuration of the International Moth class. The class contains the same \"T\" foils design on the centerboard and rudder, with the same narrow hull shape. The largest difference between the two classes is that the Wazsp is heavier due the foils being constructed out of aluminum instead of carbon fiber. Due to heavier design, the top speed of the waszp is only 26.7 knots, however its cheaper materials have made it a popular and accessible class, despite its relative youth. Most recently, the Waszp class has partnered with SailGP to develop a pathway for young sailors to work their way into the professional field of sailing.\n69F.\nThe 69F also known as the Persico 69F is a 3-4 person fully carbon foiling monohull, resembling that of a skiff, designed by Wilson-Marquinez and built by Persico Marine. The newly founded one-design class had its first racing series in 2020, starting in Europe and then making its way over to the United States in 2022. The boat consists of a singular t-shaped rudder foil, two 'L' foils on each side, and a singular daggerboard in the center of the boat for stability. The 69F is 6.9 meters long and contains a fully battened main sail and jib alongside a gennaker, totaling a sail area of 69.0 meters.\nLaser dinghy.\nThe first time a Laser foiled was in December 2009 by Ian Ward in Sydney, Australia. \nTop speeds of around 23-25kts are possible with this kit. The foils can be removed and the boat remains class legal. This foiling system is unique in that it is retractable, has flapless foils and the height sensing 'wand' is integrated within the daggerboard.\nOptimist.\nThe \"world's least advanced sailboat\" was converted to hydrofoiling by the Chalmers University of Technology, in Sweden, in 2017.\nThe Optimist, only 2.3 metres in length and with a sail area of 3.3 square metres, is normally limited to speeds below 4 knots. The hydrofoils allows the optimist dinghy to achieve 12 knots in only 12 knots of wind.\nAC75.\nThe AC75 (America's Cup 75 class) is a 75 ft sailboat class, governing the construction and operation of the yachts used in the 2021 America's Cup. The boat type is a foiling monohull with canting ballasted T-wing hydrofoils mounted on port and starboard topside longitudinal drums, a centerline T-wing rudder, and no keel. Speeds of 50 knots were predicted based on computer simulations and in fact have been exceeded in the Prada Cup by the America Magic's boat in January 2021.\nIQFoil.\nThe IQFoil windsurfer class selected by World Sailing to be used in the Summer Olympics starting 2024.\nKeelboat/Hybrids.\nIMOCA 60.\nThe IMOCA 60 class, originally a non-foiling offshore racer competing in around the globe races such as the Volvo Ocean Race and the Vendeé Globe was re-designed with S-shaped daggerboard foils. The new foil designs allowed for enough lift a portion of the boat out of the water, making it a partially foiling boat, reducing the overall drag and increasing the top speed of the boat. The IMOCA 60 Hugo Boss 7, skippered by British skipper Alex Thomson is one the recent IMOCA 60 boats with semi foiling features.\nMW40OF.\nWhile only in its design phase, the MW40OF is modeled after the 69F and similar to other offshore racers to be a fully foiling offshore racer equipped with C-shaped daggerboard Foils and T-shaped rudder foils and a crew of 5 people.\nCatamarans.\nAmerica's Cup catamarans.\nFoils have been used in the America's Cup since 2013.\nGC32.\nThe GC32 is carbon fibre production hydrofoil catamaran 32 feet in length (9.75 meters). It has a top speed of about . They are sailed in the GC32 Racing Tour, and have replaced the Extreme 40's in the Extreme Sailing Series.\nAC72.\nThe 2013 America's Cup featured daggerboard catamarans. Under the terms of the protocol, these daggerboards could not feature trim tabs, could not exceed the beam of the boat when raised and could not be adjusted when lowered, but a loophole exploited by three teams was to create T-shaped rudders and L-shaped daggerboards of which the leeward appendage serves as a hydrofoil on all points of sailing conditions in winds over 10 knots. On September 6, 2012, in Auckland, during Team New Zealand's fifth day of trials, their boat achieved with a level trim and no heeling in 17 knots of breeze.\nAC45f/AC50.\nThe 2015–16 America's Cup World Series was raced with hydrofoiling AC45f catamarans, which are smaller versions of the AC72.\nThe 2017 America's Cup was raced in the fully foiling AC50 class.\nF50.\nThe F50 sailboat one design class is adapted from the AC50 class with modifications in new control systems, modular wingsails, and new carbon layer technologies within the foils and hull. The class is used within the SailGP series and is the first sailboat class to break 50.0 knots (57.5 mph/92.6 km/h) during a race, and is claimed that the top speed of the boat is 52.2 knots. The boat also has a variety of rudder foils, board foils, wingssails, and jibs to be used in various combination with a crew of 3-5 people based on the wind speeds There currently exists a total of 8 active boats with teams from the United States, Spain, Japan, France, Denmark, Australia, New Zealand, and Great Britain. In the upcoming 2022–2023 season, two teams from Canada and Switzerland plan to join the competition.\nC-Class catamarans.\nRecent International C-class catamaran have been foiling, and further development is expected.\nA-Class catamarans.\nInternational A-class catamaran rule 8 initially allowed hydrofoils, but was changed to partially restrict them in 2009, in response to improving technology. The rule required \"that all foils must be inserted from the top of the hull, and that there must be a minimum distance between the tips of the bottom of the boards of 75cm from the centreline\". The 2014 A-Class Catamaran World Titles in Takapuna New Zealand demonstrated early foiling capabilities to the class. Now the A-Class can foil stably downwind in 6 knots and upwind in 12 knots or more. Peak speeds are reported to be about 30 knots and 2.5X wind speed. The A-Class has set the standard for 4-point foiling that many classes are now adopting.\nNacra 17 catamaran.\nThe Nacra 17 as raced at the 2016 Olympics was capable of elevated foiling under some conditions. For the 2017 World Championships, the Nacra was upgraded to a fully foiling yacht, to be raced at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\nNacra F20 catamaran.\nThe Nacra F20 is a two-person catamaran similar in design to Nacra Sailing's former 20-foot catamaran and the Nacra 17; however, every component is made of carbon, from the hull, mast, and foils. The Nacra F20 uses 'L' foil daggerboard on each hull and T-shaped rudder foils.\nFlying Phantom.\nThe Flying Phantom is a catamaran similar to the Nacra that uses 'L' foils on each hull and 'T' Foils on the rudders.\niFLY15.\niFLY15 is a 15-foot hydrofoil catamaran equipped with automatic foils, built by CEC Catamarans GmbH. It uses a mechanical automatic system to stabilize the horizontal trim in the longitudinal and transverse directions. Jibes are facilitated by the four T-shaped foils which are always in the water and stabilize the boat.\nUFO.\nSimilar in design to a moth, the UFO is a small single person foiling dinghy with a T-foil daggerboard and a T-foil rudder. The boat is made out of fiberglass with carbon rigging and was meant to be user friendly, low cost boat in comparison to the moth or Waszp. Sailing the boat in subpar wind conditions proved to be easier and more enjoyable than a Waszp or Moth as the catamaran hulls provided increased stability.\nGunBoats G4.\nThe G4 is a junior racer with cruiser content and comfort made by DNA Performance Sailing. The boat design was based on an A-Class Catamaran, containing 'L' foils on each hull and 'T' foils for the rudders and is claimed to reach a top speed of 35 knots. The G4 was designed as a hybrid between racing boats and cruising yachts, capable of foiling or not foiling based on the desires of the user. The Boat was meant to be sailed with 6 people and was capable of housing more. The G4 is no longer in production.\nTrimarans.\nTriFoiler.\nIn the 1990s the Hobie Cat company manufactured the TriFoiler (no longer in production), a twin-sail trimaran with a mainsail on each outrigger capable of 35+ knot speeds in typical sailing conditions, making the TriFoiler the fastest production sailboat in the world. The prototype of the Hobie TriFoiler, called Longshot, was developed by brothers Dan and Greg Ketterman in conjunction with Russell Long. Though more streamlined than the Trifoiler and having smaller hydrofoils, Longshot still holds the Class A speedsailing record of 43.55 knots on a 500-meter course, set in Tarifa Spain in 1993. Until recently, it was the only existing speedsailing record held by a hydrofoil, but the recent records of Hydroptère have added to the list with record breaking runs across the English Channel.\nWindRider Rave.\nIn 1998, WindRider LLC introduced the WindRider Rave, a popular two-person trimaran hydrofoil capable of lifting off in as little as 12-13 knots of wind. The Rave is capable of sailing between 1.5 and 2 times wind speed. The boat's mainsail has no boom. The Rave broke new ground in the development of flapped foils and control systems.\nOther wind craft.\nWind foiling.\nWindfoiling otherwise known as Windsurf Foiling are windsurf boards equipped with two T-shaped hydrofoil wings of opposite orientation connected by a fuselauge and a mast inserting into the board. The front wing is larger and provides upwards lift while the rear wing provides stability with downward lift. Many of the hydrofoils used in windfoiling can vary in size in order to obtain a greater combination of lift and top speed. The most recent development in windfoiling was the creation of the IQFoil one design Olympic Windsurfing class by Starboard Windsurfing used to replace the in the 2024 Olympics. The IQFoil contains a fully battened, cambered sail alongside a board made of a carbon reflex sandwich design and a carbon and aluminum foil. The class was created in 2020 and is similar to the open windfoiling class used in the PWA(Professional Windsurfing Association) competitions.\nFoil kitesurfing.\nThe Formula Kite class was introduced into the 2024 Summer Olympics as a non-one design class. The equipment contains a singly T-shaped foil and a board. A similar setup is also used for recreational foil kitesurfing.\nWing foiling.\nWing foiling is developed from Windfoiling, Foil Kitesurfing, and surfing. It uses a T-shaped foil on a small board in which a person holds an inflatable sail, small in size and similar to a kite, known as a wing.\nExperimental designs.\nNon-production experimental designs have been built:"

        "text": "Group 16 is a rugby league competition on the south coast of New South Wales, run under the auspices of the Country Rugby League. The Group 16 district covers the area from Batemans Bay down the Sapphire Coast to Eden, and inland across the Southern Tablelands to the Snowy Mountains towns of Cooma and Jindabyne.\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia the commencement of Group 16 2020 season was postponed and subsequently cancelled.\nThe competition is held across four grades, First Grade, Reserve Grade, Ladies League Tag and Under 18s.\nThe competition also has a junior league with clubs aligned with their respective teams of the senior competition.\nTeams.\nFormer Clubs.\nFormer clubs that once played in the area include:\nSub-Group Competitions.\nFrom the mid-1920s to the mid-1950s Rugby League was played in what became known as sub-group competitions.\nFar South Coast / Northern Sub-Group.\nThis competition began as the Far South Coast Rugby League in 1925, with Wyndham Oaks, Bega Waratahs, Bega Federals, Candelo, Pambula Buccaneers and Eden as the competing teams.\nIn 1937 the first grade competition was not held, with teams playing challenge cup matches instead, although a reserve grade competition was held. Following the 1940 Grand Final, competition was suspended due to World War Two.\nCompetition resumed in 1946.\nPambula / Imlay.\nA competition centred around Pambula was held in 1933. Four teams contested the 1936 season: Pambula, Eden, Wolumla and Burragate.\nThe 1947 Imlay Rugby League competition included Bemboka, Candelo, Eden, Pambula, Tathra, Wolumla and Wyndham. The Bega Rovers and Bega Wests switched from the Northern Sub-Group to the Imlay League in 1955.\nSouthern Monaro.\nThe four towns of Bibbenluke, Bombala, Cathcart and Delegate regularly played Rugby Union matches in the early decades of the 20th century. The clubs trialed league rules in 1928 but returned to Union in 1929. In 1932, however, Southern Monaro Rugby League was established as a sub-group of Group 16. In 1935, the three first grade teams became two by the end of the season. Bombala fielded two teams (Blues and Blacks), and Nimmitabel joined to make a five team 1936 competition. From 1937, the clubs reverted to challenge cup matches.\nGroup 19 Rugby League (1950–1970).\nA senior Rugby League competition under the enumeration Group 19 ran from the post-war years until 1970. Participating teams included Bibbenluke, Bombala, Delegate, Jindabyne and (usually) Adaminaby. In most seasons two or three Cooma teams participated – the Cooma Rovers and St Patricks, Cooma Blues or Cooma Citizens. Employees engaged in the Snowy River Scheme fielded teams for short periods – Public Service, Snowy and the intriguingly named Utah-Island Bend.\nIn 1971 the northern Group 19 clubs – Cooma Rovers, Adaminaby, Jindabyne, Cooma Citizens and Nimmitabel agreed to combine playing resources and field a team in the Group 16 competition, as the Alpine Wanderers. The three teams from southern Monaro also joined the combined competition, although they remained separate clubs.\nThe enumeration Group 19 was later redeployed to the northern tablelands of New South Wales, with teams from Armidale, Glen Innes, Guyra, Narwan, Uralla and Walcha competing under that banner in the 1980s."

        "title": "Joe Coleman (baseball, born 1947)",
        "text": "Joseph Howard Coleman (born February 3, 1947) is an American former baseball player. He played professional baseball as a pitcher from 1965 to 1982, including 15 seasons in Major League Baseball with the Washington Senators (1965–70), Detroit Tigers (1971–76), Chicago Cubs (1976), Oakland Athletics (1977–78), Toronto Blue Jays (1978), San Francisco Giants (1979) and Pittsburgh Pirates (1979). He compiled a 142–135 win–loss record and 3.70 earned run average (ERA) in 484 major league games.\nColeman averaged more than 20 wins per season from 1971 to 1973. He recorded 236 strikeouts in 1971, third best in the American League, was selected to the American League All-Star team in 1972, and recorded 23 wins in 1973, second highest in the American League.\nColeman is the son of former major league pitcher Joe Coleman and the father of former major league pitcher Casey Coleman.\nEarly years.\nColeman was born in Boston, Massachusetts, in 1947. His father, Joe Coleman (Joseph Patrick Coleman), was a pitcher in Major League Baseball between 1942 and 1955. Coleman attended Natick High School in Natick, Massachusetts. In high school, Coleman was considered \"an overpowering pitcher\" who was \"watched enviously by major league scouts.\" He also attended Ted Williams' baseball camp in Lakeville, Massachusetts, while attending high school. Williams reportedly taught Coleman how to throw a curve ball at his camp, and why it curved.\nPlaying career.\nWashington Senators.\nIn June 1965, Coleman was drafted out of high school by the Washington Senators in the first round (third overall pick) of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft, baseball's first amateur draft. Coleman was represented in contract negotiations by his father, who reportedly secured a club record signing bonus of $75,000 for Coleman.\nAfter a 12-game stint with the Burlington Senators in the Carolina League, Coleman made his Major League Baseball debut at age 18, less than four months after graduating from high school, on September 28, 1965, throwing a four-hitter against the Kansas City Athletics and pitched two complete game victories in the final week of the 1965 season. He compiled a 2–0 record and a 1.00 ERA, and was the youngest player in the American League at the time of his big league debut. After the 1965 season concluded, Coleman and his father opened a store in Natick, Massachusetts known as Joe Coleman &amp; Son Sporting Goods.\nColeman spent most of the 1966 season with the York White Roses in the Eastern League, compiling a 7–19 record in 32 games. In 1967, Coleman won a spot in the Senators' starting rotation, appeared in 28 games, and compiled an 8–9 record with a 4.63 ERA. He remained in the Senators' starting rotation for an additional three years, compiling records of 12–16 with a 3.27 ERA in 1968, 12–13 with a 3.27 ERA in 1969, and 8–12 with a 3.58 ERA in 1970.\nDetroit Tigers.\nOn October 9, 1970, Coleman was part of a multi-player deal that sent Coleman, Ed Brinkman, Jim Hannan and Aurelio Rodriguez to the Detroit Tigers in exchange for Denny McLain, Elliott Maddox, Norm McRae and Don Wert. On March 27, 1971, Coleman was knocked unconscious by a line drive hit by Ted Simmons of the St. Louis Cardinals during a spring training game. Coleman sustained a linear skull fracture, was hospitalized for two weeks, and remained on the disabled list for 21 days before joining the Tigers in May 1971. Coleman had a 7–6 record on July 4, 1971, but he finished the season with a 13–3 record from that point forward. During the 1971 season, Coleman compiled a 20–9 record and a 3.15 ERA while recording 16 complete games. His 236 strikeouts in 1971 was a career high and ranked third in the American League behind Mickey Lolich and Vida Blue.\nColeman had another strong season in 1972, compiling a 19–14 record with a 2.80 ERA and 222 strikeouts in 280 innings pitched. He was selected to play for the American League in the 1972 All-Star Game, though he did not appear in the game due to injury. Coleman's father appeared in the 1948 All-Star Game, making the Colemans the first father and son to be chosen to pitch in an All-Star Game. Coleman also helped the Tigers win the American League Eastern Division. In Game 3 of the 1972 American League Championship Series, with the Tigers facing elimination after losing Games 1 and 2, Coleman threw a complete-game shutout against the Oakland Athletics and set an ALCS record with 14 strikeouts in a single game. (Coleman's ALCS record broke a record of 12 set by Jim Palmer in 1972, was later tied by Mike Boddicker in 1983 and was broken by Mike Mussina in 1997.)\nPrior to the start of the 1973 season, Coleman went on a diet and lost 25 pounds, dropping from 226 to 201 pounds. The trimmer Coleman won the first four starts of the 1973 season. Despite a down season for the Tigers team, Coleman posted a career-high 23 wins, second in the American League behind Wilbur Wood's 24 wins.\nIn his first three seasons with the Tigers, Coleman compiled a win–loss record of 62–38 and pitched 38 complete games with a 3.16 ERA and 660 strikeouts. Only four American League pitchers – Wilbur Wood (70), Jim Palmer (63), Mickey Lolich (63), and Catfish Hunter (63) – had more wins than Coleman over those same three years. Coleman credited much of his success from 1971 to 1973 to the confidence instilled in him by Detroit manager Billy Martin.\nIn 1974, Detroit had a new manager, Ralph Houk.\nOn April 11, 1974, Coleman lost a bid for a no-hitter in the eighth inning when Gene Michael of the New York Yankees hit a one-out single. By May 15, 1974, Coleman had a 6–1 record and appeared to be on track for the best season of his career. However, he did not win another game for two months, and his performance dropped off markedly. He finished the 1974 season with a 14–12 record and a 4.32 ERA in 41 starts. He walked an astounding 158 batters in 1974 (a Tigers single-season record) for a career high rate of 5.0/9 IP. At the end of the 1974 season, Coleman said: \"It was really strange. My arm felt better than it ever had before in my life. But I couldn't do it. It was just one of those crazy things. At times I didn't have any idea what I was doing out there.\"\nIn 1975, Coleman's performance declined further, as he compiled a 10–18 record with a 5.55 ERA. In 1976, Coleman started 12 games for Detroit in the first two months of the season, posting a 2–5 record with a 4.86 ERA.\nChicago Cubs.\nOn June 8, 1976, the Chicago Cubs acquired Coleman by waiver purchase from the Tigers. The Cubs used Coleman principally as a relief pitcher. He appeared in 39 games for the Cubs, all but four in relief, and compiled a 2–8 record with a 4.10 ERA.\nOakland Athletics.\nOn March 15, 1977, the Cubs traded Coleman to the Oakland Athletics for pitcher Jim Todd. Oakland owner Charlie Finley released Coleman in the spring, but then reversed the decision after being told Coleman had a two-year contract that would have to be paid. Coleman rebounded during the 1977 season with the assistance of a hypnotist. In addition to the skull fracture sustained in 1971, Coleman had been hit by line drives 10 or 12 times in 1974. Chicago coaches noticed in 1976 that Coleman was recoiling immediately after throwing each pitch. Coleman recalled, \"I went to see a Catholic priest who doubles as a hypnotist. He put me under seven times in four days. After that, I didn't have any fear of getting hit, and my control was better.\"\nColeman appeared in 43 games for the Athletics in 1977, including 12 games as a starting pitcher. He compiled a 4–4 record with a much-improved 2.96 ERA. He was one of only 10 American League pitchers in 1977 to compile over 100 innings pitched and maintain an ERA under 3.00.\nPrior to the 1978 season, Oakland owner Finley again sought to discard Coleman, asking him to report to the Athletics' minor league club in Vancouver. Coleman refused and compiled a 3–0 record and a 0.00 ERA in his first eight appearances of the 1978 season. Coleman had a 1.37 ERA when he was sold by Oakland to the Toronto Blue Jays for the waiver price of $10,000. Finley reportedly \"blew his top\" after Coleman gave up a home run to Chicago's Lamar Johnson. Bobby Winkles resigned as Oakland's manager after Finley's impulsive decision to sell the club's most effective relief pitcher. Days later, Finley offered to buy Coleman back from Toronto for double the price Toronto had paid. Blue Jays' president, Peter Bavasi, declined Finley's proposal, suspecting that Finley had found another team prepared to pay more for Coleman. Coleman noted at the time that he was happy to escape Finley. After his bid to reacquire Coleman was rejected, Finley claimed he had only wanted to reacquire Coleman to trade him to Pittsburgh and lashed out at Coleman: \"He's a very fine old man, but all he does is throw that slop up there. Maybe he can do all right. He doesn't throw hard enough now to break a pane of glass. He was spending his spare time trying to teach our young guys to pitch. How can he do that when he can't pitch himself?\"\nToronto Blue Jays.\nShortly after arriving in Toronto, Coleman met with club president, Peter Bavasi. Despite having rejected Finley's bid to reacquire Coleman, Bavasi informed Coleman that he did not fit into the Blue Jays' plans. Coleman recalled, \"It was a shock to me. I didn't know why I was here. He didn't want to get into a contract situation with me that would take up a spot of one of the younger kids.\" Despite not fitting into the Blue Jays' plans, Coleman compiled a 2–0 record in 31 relief appearances for the club. He finished the full 1978 season with an unbeaten 5–0 record.\nSan Francisco Giants.\nAfter a strong 1978 season, Coleman announced in late October 1978 that he would not return to Toronto and that he intended to become a free agent. He said at the time, \"I've regained some of my confidence and probably I'm in the best shape I've ever been.\" Coleman signed with the San Francisco Giants on April 1, 1979. After five relief appearances with the Giants, and despite not allowing an earned run, Coleman was released on April 21, 1979.\nPittsburgh Pirates.\nAfter being released by the Giants, Coleman signed in May 1979 with the Portland Beavers, the Pittsburgh Pirates' Triple A affiliate in the Pacific Coast League. Coleman compiled a 5–1 record and a 2.78 ERA in 31 games for Portland from May to July 1979. In mid-July 1979, the Pirates purchased Coleman from the Beavers. During the Pirates' pennant drive in the second half of the 1979 season, Coleman made 10 relief appearances and compiled a 6.10 ERA in innings pitched. Although the 1979 Pirates advanced to win the 1979 World Series, Coleman did not appear in any post-season games. He appeared in his final major league game on September 24, 1979.\nSpokane Indians.\nColeman's major league career ended with the Pirates in 1979. However, he continued to play in the Pacific Coast League for the Spokane Indians from 1980 to 1982. Pitching principally in relief, Coleman compiled a 4–2 record in 40 games for Spokane. He also served as Spokane's catcher for one game in 1980, allowing all three base-runners to steal second base. After Coleman's catching debut, club manager Rene Lachemann joked, \"He (Joe) did an adequate job of catching, but not of throwing.\" During his time with Spokane, Coleman also served as the club's pitching coach and helped coach the University of Washington baseball team.\nCareer totals.\nIn 15 major league seasons, Coleman appeared in 484 games (340 as a starter), pitched innings and compiled a 142–135 win–loss record with 234 home runs and 1,003 walks allowed, 1,728 strikeouts, 90 hit batsmen, 118 wild pitches and a 3.70 career ERA.\nCoaching career.\nColeman served as a coach in various organizations, beginning with his service as pitching coach for the Spokane Indians. The Spokane club was an affiliate of the Seattle Mariners in 1980 and 1981, but became an affiliate of the California Angels in 1982. In 1983, the Spokane club disbanded, and the Angels gave Coleman a choice of taking over as pitching coach in Edmonton or becoming the manager of the Peoria Suns, the Angels' newly organized Single A affiliate. Coleman chose the managerial position in Peoria. Coleman joked about the foibles of his young players after arriving in Peoria:\"One game, my right fielder dropped a fly ball. The runner was on third by the time he gets to the ball, but he launches it and it lands in the left field corner at the foul pole. . . . Some crazy things have happened, but it's constant. I go to the ballpark every day and expect something crazy to happen that day.\"\nColeman continued to serve in the Angels' organization for several years after his stint in Peoria. In 1987, he was the organization's roving minor-league pitching instructor, and in 1988 he joined the Angels' major league staff as bullpen coach.\nIn 1991, Coleman left the Angels to become the pitching coach for the St. Louis Cardinals under manager Joe Torre. He served in that position through the 1994 season. In October 1994, the Cardinals opted not to renew Coleman's contract in a front office shakeup that also saw the arrival of a new general manager and the departure of Bucky Dent as the club's third-base coach.\nIn 1996, Coleman returned to the Angels' organization. He served initially as a scout and then took over as the club's pitching coach for the last two months of the 1996 season. He was named bullpen coach for the 1997 season. He continued to serve as the Angels' bullpen coach through the 2000 season. In 2001, Coleman was hired as the pitching coach for the Durham Bulls, the Triple A affiliate of the Tampa Bay Rays. In 2007, Coleman left Durham and became the pitching coach of the Lakeland Flying Tigers, the Class A affiliate of the Detroit Tigers. He remained in that position until September 2011. Since 2012, Coleman has been the pitching coach for the Jupiter Hammerheads, the Class A affiliate of the Florida Marlins. The 2014 season marked Coleman's 50th year working in professional baseball as a player, scout, coach, instructor or manager.\nFamily.\nIn 1982, Coleman met his future wife, Donna, after moving to Fort Myers, Florida. Their son, Casey Coleman, was born in Fort Myers in 1987 and pitched in Major League Baseball for the Chicago Cubs from 2010 to 2012 and for the Kansas City Royals in 2014."

It was modelled on English football's Charity Shield, and was held between 1985 and 1995. Normally the team that had won last season's championship would play the team that currently held the Challenge Cup. In years where the same team won both trophies the following season's Charity Shield was between them and the Premiership winners. In years where one team won all three competitions then the match would be between them and the second placed team in the championship.\nThe Charity Shield was held at a variety of venues; the Okells Bowl in Douglas on the Isle of Man was used initially with some regularity."

One of ten teams competing in the ICC Women's Championship (the highest level of the sport), the team is organised by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC), a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nSri Lanka made their One Day International (ODI) debut in 1997, against the Netherlands, and later in the year participated in the 1997 World Cup in India. The team has since participated in every edition of the World Cup, with a fifth-place finish at the 2013 event being its best performance. At the World Twenty20, Sri Lanka has likewise played at every tournament, although the team has never progressed past the first round. Sri Lanka played their first and only Test match to date in April 1998, defeating Pakistan.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nSri Lanka's international debut came in 1997 with a three-match ODI series against The Netherlands, which they lost 2–1. This was part of their preparation for the World Cup in India the following month, in which they reached the quarter finals, losing to England. The following year they hosted a tour by Pakistan, winning the three ODIs as well as what was the first Test match for both countries. It remains Sri Lanka's sole Test match. The Netherlands toured Sri Lanka again in 1999, and this time the Sri Lankans were much more successful, winning all five ODIs.\n2000s.\nSri Lanka finished sixth in the 2000 World Cup, and their next international engagement was against Pakistan at home in 2002, winning all six ODIs. They also won all six ODIs in an away series against the West Indies the following year.\nIn 2004 they hosted the inaugural Women's Asia Cup, which was reduced to a series against India after the withdrawal of Pakistan. They lost the series. The following year they again finished sixth in the World Cup. In 2005/06, they visited Pakistan to take part in the second Asia Cup, finishing as runners up to India.\n2010s.\nIn 2014, allegations of sexual abuse by Sri Lanka officials surfaced. Some players were apparently compelled to perform sexual favours for the officials to earn or keep their place in the national team.\nOn 2013 Women's Cricket World Cup, Sri Lanka beat England in a pool match, which was a major upset in Women's ODI history. England are world's top ranked team and Sri Lanka is in underdog status, but this win gave a full of attention in World Cricket. Sri Lanka women next beat India women and finally they finished as fifth in the rankings.\nOn 8 August 2018, after a five-year gap since his previous spell in charge, Harsha de Silva was reappointed as the head coach of the team by the SLC.\n2020s.\nIn 2021, Sri Lanka qualified for the 2022-25 ICC Women's Championship after the abandonment of the 2021 Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulted in qualifications for the 2022 Women's Cricket World Cup and the next cycle of the Women's Championship being decided via WODI rankings.\nIn 2023, Sri Lanka secured their first-ever series victory against England in England.

In addition the club also won the 2nd XI League and finished as runners-up in the Third XI League.\nIn 2019, they again finished the season in first place. For the 2021 season the captain is Daniel Pickup, and the Club Professional is Ockert Erasmus.\nHistory.\nDuring the Middle Ages Turf Moor was one of Burnley's commons and the inhabitants likely cut turf here for fuel.\nBurnley Cricket Club has its origin in a side called the Trafalgar Club, known to have played a match in the Bull Croft (near the town hall) in 1828. Over the next few years they played matches at Stoneyholme and Healey Heights, before taking the name Burnley Cricket Club by 1833. A field near Red Lion Street then became their home until in 1843 they moved to Turf Moor. After two years here, the team played for another two near Duke Bar before making Turf Moor their permanent home. In 1857 the team was disestablished, and between 1859 and 1863 a team organised by the Burnley Militia, called the Burnley Wellington Club, played at the ground. In 1864 Burnley Cricket Club was re-formed and was soon making progress, fielding three teams.\nNotable matches in the period before a league was organised include: A three-day visit from the All-England Eleven (then headed by George Parr) in 1868; matches against an Australian eleven, featuring Fred Spofforth and Billy Murdoch, in 1878 and 1880, of which Burnley won the first; and an 1890-match between two visiting ladies' teams which attracted thousands of spectators.\nThe cricket club sponsored the formation of Burnley Football Club, and in January 1883, they leased seven acres of land for the team, situated between the cricket field and Bee Hole Colliery to the east. They also made a donation of £65 (the equivalent of £ as of ) toward the setup costs. In 1885, a dispute broke out as the cricketers complained that the footballers left the shared dressing room uncleaned and did not pay toward repairs. In 1889, after more disputes, Burnley F.C. separated from the cricket club and agreed to pay £77 per year (the equivalent of £ as of ) to rent the stadium.\nIn the early years of the Lancashire League, Burnley were one of the dominant teams, champions six times by 1913, including three-in-a-row from 1906."

PATHF's primary functions is to organize competitions for national teams and clubs, and to conduct Men's World Handball Championship and Women's World Handball Championship qualifying tournaments.\nOn 14 January 2018, during the IHF Council meeting, PATHF was suspended by International Handball Federation and was divided into two continental confederations namely the North America and the Caribbean Handball Confederation and the South and Central America Handball Confederation. The IHF Council decision was taken on the facts that there are no signs of development in the level of handball and beach handball in the North American, Central American and the Caribbean countries. There was some development in South American level but that was also not comparable to the other continents like Europe, Asia and Africa. No team from Americas had ever reached to the semifinal stage of the IHF World Men's Handball Championship and the IHF Men's Junior World Championship till date.

        "text": "The Asian Handball Federation (AHF) is the governing body of handball and beach handball in Asia. It has 44 member countries, mostly located on the Asian continent, but excludes the transcontinental countries with territory in both Europe and Asia – Azerbaijan, Georgia, Russian Federation and Turkey – which are instead members of European Handball Federation (EHF). Three other states located along the western fringe of Asia – Cyprus, Armenia and Israel – are also EHF members. Hong Kong China and Macau, although not independent countries (both are Special regions of China), are also members of the AHF.\nOne of IHF's six continental confederations, the AHF was formed officially on 26 August 1974 in Tehran (Imperial State of Iran), on the sidelines of the 7th Asian Games 1974. The AHF headquarters is located in Kuwait City (Kuwait). Its current President is Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah from Kuwait who is a member of House of Al Sabah, the ruling family of Kuwait.\nHistory.\nThe Asian Handball Federation (AHF) is in one way absolutely unique: during its history till date it had two Presidents - and they were father and son.\nWhen in 1976 the federation was officially founded and Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah was elected for president, the committed Sheikh had already put a lot of efforts and preparation work into it. In 1974, during the 7th Asian Games in Tehran (Iran), he applied as head of the Kuwaiti delegation at the executive committee for the inclusion of Handball into the sports programme and the foundation of a continental handball federation. The explanation was easy and convincing: meanwhile handball was widely spread in Asia. The leaders of the Asian Game accepted handball as an official sport and asked the Sheikh to act as interim president and to prepare the statutes of the federation. In this task he was supported by the Secretary General Syed Abul Hassan (Pakistan).\nPresidents.\n\" Sheikh Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah died on 2 August 1990 during the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait while defending Dasman Palace. Mohammed Ali Abul acted as Acting President till the war finished in 1991.\n\" Sheikh Ahmed step down from AHF Presidency following a guilty verdict against him in a Swiss forgery trial.

AHF replaced experienced and IHF nominated German referees Lemme and Ulrich with Jordanian referees Al-Shoubaki and Hirzallah, neither of whom stood on the list of IHF-qualified referees having \"IHF Status\", meaning that they had not completed the Global Referees Training Programme (GRTP), a program established by the IHF for the development of IHF-level referees. The Jordanian referee pair completely destroyed the South Korean team with more than 20 wrong decisions only in first half of the match which favoured the Kuwaiti team. IHF COC Chairman Aleksandr Kozhukhov (Russia) who was appointed by IHF as supervisor for the event and member of AHF Technical Committee Khalaf Al-Enezi (Kuwait) intervened into the matter at half-time of the match and asked the referees to be fair but the South Korean team\nnevertheless could not get the result in their own favour losing the match by 28–20.\nLater, on 17 December 2007, in an IHF Council meeting held in Paris (France), IHF decided not to approve the results of the event conduct by AHF and decided to replay both men's and women's events due to biased referee allegations. AHF objected against this decision and warned all the AHF member federations not to participate in the replay organised by IHF. Only South Korea and Japan participated in the IHF replay and South Korea won both men's and women's matches. On February 5, 2008, AHF imposed a fine of $1000 on both the Japan and South Korea and banned them from participating in any event organised by AHF until the fine is paid.\nWhen the matter becomes that complicated, both AHF and IHF mutually decided to took the case to Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) for decision. The Kazakhstan Handball Federation and Kuwait Handball Association also want to become a party in the case but CAS refused their appeal. On 20 May 2008, after hearing all the parties, CAS decided to approve the result of IHF men's replay and also approved the AHF organised women's event results."

        "text": "\"Two World Wars and One World Cup\" is a football song sung by supporters of the England national football team to the tune of \"Camptown Races\" as part of the England–Germany football rivalry. The chant refers to the United Kingdom's victories in the First and Second World Wars, and England's 4–2 victory against West Germany after extra time in the final of the 1966 FIFA World Cup. The chant has also spawned similar chants such as \"Stand up if you won the war\" to the tune of \"Go West\".\nHistory.\nThe chant is believed to have been created in the 1960s, after England had won the World Cup against West Germany. It was created by England fans to reflect on England's historic achievements. In 2006, Market traders in Leicester, Leicestershire, were banned from selling T-shirts with \"Two World Wars, 1 World Cup\" on them by Leicester City Council amid fears that the shirts \"could cause offence\". Before the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office attempted to dissuade England fans from singing \"Two World Wars and One World Cup\" while in Germany. Despite these attempts, the chant was widely used by England fans whilst in Germany.\nThe chant has been criticised as \"jingoistic\", although a number of England supporters feel they are justified in singing it against Germany. However, it has been praised in some foreign media with one Australian commentator stating envy of England fans for being able to use it during the 2010 FIFA World Cup. A Canadian reporter also said that the chant reflected \"a deeply historic sense of national honour\". During the 2010 FIFA World Cup South African communications company, MTN Group ran a television advertisement on South African television involving the chant.\nOther uses.\n\"Two World Wars and One World Cup\" is also the name of an episode of the BBC documentary \"Everyman\"."

        "text": "The Ireland women's cricket team represents Ireland in international women's cricket. Cricket in Ireland is governed by Cricket Ireland and organised on an All-Ireland basis, meaning the Irish women's team represents both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.\nIreland made its One-Day International (ODI) debut in 1987, against Australia, and the following year played at the 1988 World Cup, making the first of five appearances at the tournament. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, Ireland was considered to be a top-level team, playing regular ODI series and placing as high as fifth at the World Cup (in 1993, out of eight teams). In 2000, the team played its only Test match, defeating the Pakistan women's team. Although it still retains ODI status, Ireland has not qualified for a World Cup since the 2005 event. The team has, however, qualified for the ICC World Twenty20 on two occasions, in 2014 and 2016. In December 2018, Cricket Ireland offered professional contracts to the women players for the first time.\nIn April 2021, the ICC awarded permanent Test and One Day International (ODI) status to all full member women's teams.\nHistory.\n1980s.\nThe Irish women's team entered the international arena well before their male counterparts, playing their first ODIs in a three match series against Australia in 1987, a full 19 years before the men's team would make their ODI debut. They lost all three games by more than 100 runs, but were still invited to take part in the World Cup the following year in Australia.\nIn that World Cup, they finished fourth, losing to New Zealand in the third place play-off game. Ireland subsequently came fourth of five in the tournament, with Ireland's only two wins both came against The Netherlands. The next year, Ireland took part in the first Women's European Championship in Denmark, finishing fourth on run rate, with their only win coming against the hosts.\n1990s.\nThe first two years of the 1990s again saw Ireland compete in the European Championships, finishing as runners up to England in 1990, and third place in 1991. Sandwiched between those two tournaments was a 2 match ODI series against England, with England winning both games, the second by 10 wickets.\n1993 saw them compete in the World Cup again, this time finishing in fifth place. The next European Championship in 1995 again saw them finish as runners up to England. Following this, they settled into a pattern of playing ODIs against whichever team was touring England, a pattern that continues to this day. The 1997 World Cup saw them lose to New Zealand in the quarter-finals. The end of the 1990s saw them again finish as runners up to England in the European Championship in 1999.\n2000s.\nIreland played their first ever Test match in 2000, beating Pakistan by an innings inside two days in Dublin. This is still their only Test match however. They also dominated the ODI series against Pakistan, winning 4–0 with a fifth game rained off. They still could only finish seventh in the World Cup later that year though, their only win coming against The Netherlands. The following year, they won the European Championship, and that remains the only time out of seven tournaments that the England team had not won the competition.\nThat seventh place meant that they had to take part in the 2003 IWCC Trophy, the inaugural edition of what is now known simply as the World Cup Qualifier. They won every game in that tournament, which qualified them for the world cup in South Africa in 2005. They came last in that tournament, meaning they will have to qualify again for the 2009 World Cup. Later in the year, they yet again finished as runners up to England in the European Championship.\nThey played a two match ODI series against the Netherlands, winning both games. In November 2007, they went to the Women's World Cup Qualifier in Lahore, where they played Bermuda, The Netherlands, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Scotland, South Africa and an African qualifier.\nIn 2009, Ireland beat the Netherlands to win the European Championship.\nIn April 2016, Laura Delany was named as captain of Ireland women's cricket team replacing Isobel Joyce who stepped down after the 2016 ICC Women's World Twenty20 in India.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup.

        "text": "The Netherlands women's national cricket team () nicknamed the Lionesses, represents the Netherlands in international women's cricket. The team is organised by the Royal Dutch Cricket Association, which has been an associate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 1966.\nA Dutch women's team first played an international match in 1937, when Australia toured on its way to play a series in England. The team regularly played fixtures against English club sides over the following decades, but it was not until the early 1980s that regular international competition commenced. The Netherlands made its One Day International (ODI) debut in 1984, against New Zealand, and made its World Cup debut at the 1988 edition of the tournament, in Australia. Considered a top-level team from the late 1980s through to the early 2000s, the Netherlands participated in four consecutive World Cups between 1988 and 2000, and made the quarter-finals of the 1997 event. The Dutch side retained its ODI status until the 2011 World Cup Qualifier. In 2007, the team played a one-off Test match against South Africa, joining Ireland as the only associate member of the ICC to play at that level.\nIn April 2018, the ICC granted full Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between the Netherlands women and another international side since 1 July 2018 have the full WT20I status. In May 2022, the ICC announced the Netherlands as one of five women's sides to gain ODI status. Papua New Guinea, Scotland, Thailand and the United States were the other four teams.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe Netherlands took part in women's international cricket from its earliest years. As early as 1937 they hosted the Australians on the first leg of their first ever Women's Ashes tour, before visiting England late the same year.\n1980s.\nThe Dutch team played their first ODI in 1984 against New Zealand. This was 12 years before the Dutch men's team played their first ODI. They lost that game by 67 runs, and were next seen in international cricket in 1988, playing in their first World Cup, in which they finished in last place. They finished third in the first European Championship in 1989.\n1990s.\nThey again finished third in the European Championship in 1990, and finished fourth the following year. The 1993 World Cup was again a disappointment, with another last place finish. 1995 saw them again finish third in the European Championship.\n1997 was a busy year for the Dutch team, travelling to the Mikkelberg-Kunst-und-Cricket Center in Germany to play two ODIs against Denmark, a trip they repeated in 1998. They also visited Sri Lanka for a three match ODI series against the hosts, which they won 2–1. That remains the sole ODI series victory for the Dutch team. This was followed by the World Cup, in which they reached the quarter-finals.\n1999 was a year with a steep learning curve when another tour to Sri Lanka, where they suffered a 5–0 defeat in the five-match ODI series. After the European Championship in Denmark the Dutch rebuilt their squad and structure.\n2000s.\n2000 saw the Dutch team's fourth World Cup appearance, where they finished last. This was followed in 2001 by a tour to Pakistan. the hosts took a 4–0 lead in the seven match ODI series but the Netherlands bounced back admirably winning the final three games. Later in the year saw a third-place finish in the European Championship.\nTheir cricket in 2002 was a three match ODI series against New Zealand, which the Dutch were unable to win. The following year they hosted the 2003 IWCC Trophy, the inaugural edition of what is now the World Cup Qualifier. The Dutch finished third, but only the two finalists qualified for the 2005 World Cup.\nTheir next international engagement was the European Championship in 2005, finishing in fourth place. 2006 saw a two match ODI series against Ireland which was lost. Good news came from the ICC which announced that the top ten women's teams would have Test and ODI status. Their third-place finish in the IWCC Trophy in 2003 meant that the Dutch were included in this top ten. In February 2008 the Dutch women retained their test status for another four years by reaching the semi-final of the Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier.\n2020s.\nIn December 2020, the ICC announced the qualification pathway for the 2023 ICC Women's T20 World Cup. The Netherlands were named in the 2021 ICC Women's T20 World Cup Europe Qualifier regional group, alongside five other teams.\nAfter a Netherlands women's cricket team bilateral series in Thailand, in November 2022, the team were given their first ever WODI Ranking. An ODI win over higher-ranked Thailand gave the Netherlands their best global ranking ever (12th).\nSponsorship.\nSISAR B.V. became the official sponsor of the Dutch women's cricket team in December 2022. SISAR B.V. signed a sponsorship contract for three years with the KNCB.\nSquad.\nThis lists all the players who have played for Netherlands for the past 12 months.

        "text": "Brian Lara Cricket is a series of six cricket video games that are endorsed by the West Indian cricketer Brian Lara and published by Codemasters.\nGames.\nAs of 2007, there are six games in the Brian Lara Cricket series on eight video game systems, spanning thirteen years.\nBrian Lara Cricket.\n\"Brian Lara Cricket\" is the first game in the series to be endorsed by Brian Lara. It was developed by Audiogenic and published by Codemasters in 1994 for DOS and then a year later in 1995 for the Mega Drive and Amiga systems.\nBrian Lara Cricket '96.\nAlso known as \"Lara '96\", this game is a new version of Brian Lara Cricket on the Mega Drive with updated player names and statistics. It is the final game in the series to be developed by Audiogenic and was published by Codemasters in 1996.\nBrian Lara Cricket '99.\nReleased in 1999, this was the first 3D accelerated game in the series. It was the first fifth generation game in the series, developed and shipped by Codemasters for the Sony PlayStation and Windows platforms with commentary provided by Geoffrey Boycott and Jonathan Agnew. This game was also branded as \"Shane Warne Cricket '99\" in Australia and New Zealand.\nBrian Lara International Cricket 2005.\nDeveloped by Swordfish Studios for Codemasters, \"Brian Lara International Cricket 2005\" is a 6th generation console game for the PlayStation 2, Xbox and Windows. It was released to coincide with the 2005 Ashes series. BLIC 2005 builds on the 3D environment that was first introduced in Brian Lara Cricket '99 and enhances it with rendered crowds and detailed stadia. It was released in Australia as \"Ricky Ponting International Cricket 2005\".\nBrian Lara International Cricket 2007.\nOff the success of \"BLIC2005\", \"Brian Lara International Cricket 2007\" was developed. Using the same release date tactics as the previous game, it was shipped during the 2007 Cricket World Cup. The game was available for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 consoles, as well as for Windows. This version includes many graphical as well as gameplay improvements. The Xbox 360 version is the first console port in the series to be in high definition widescreen. Gameplay improvements include analogue direction control when batting, this allows the player to attempt to hit the ball in any direction. In India, it was released as \"Yuvraj Singh International Cricket 2007\". It was also the second game in the Ricky Ponting international series.\nBrian Lara Pressure Play.\n\"Brian Lara Pressure Play\" is a PSP-only version of the game, released in 2007.\nHistory.\nIn 1985, Michael McLean at Audiogenic, a subsidiary of Supersoft wrote \"Graham Gooch's Test Cricket\" for the C64 computer system. The game sold well and received high ratings, and so Audiogenic followed it up with \"Graham Gooch's All Star Cricket\" in 1987. The game that was to become \"Graham Gooch World Class Cricket\" was scheduled to be released for the Amiga and Atari ST in 1991, but development was delayed to ensure quality. When it did eventually appear in 1993 it was a huge success, reaching No.1 in the Amiga charts. A PC version followed a year later.\nIn 1994 Audiogenic identified an opportunity to capitalise on the success of Brian Lara, who had broken two long-standing world records, and rebranded World Class Cricket game as \"Brian Lara Cricket\", initially for the DOS but also later for the Amiga. A year later Audiogenic licensed \"Brian Lara Cricket\" for the Sega Mega Drive to Codemasters. It was successful and spent 10 weeks at No.1 in the UK video games chart during the summer of 1995. \"Brian Lara Cricket '96\" was released the following year in 1996 also by Codemasters, and it too got to No.1 in the charts. In late 1996 Codemasters acquired the Audiogenic development and \"Brian Lara Cricket '99\" for the PlayStation console was released in 1998.\nIn 2005 Codemasters released \"Brian Lara International Cricket 2005\" for the PlayStation 2 console, released on 21 July to coincide with the start of the 2005 Ashes series. The game received high ratings. Off the back of this success, Codemasters has developed \"Brian Lara International Cricket 2007\" which was released in March 2007, to coincide with the Cricket World Cup. \"Brian Lara Pressure Play\" followed in August for the PSP, reaching No.1 in its first week on release.\nWith Brian Lara's retirement from professional cricket in 2007 Codemasters moved away from using Lara in the title. The next cricket game released by the publisher was \"Ashes Cricket 2009\" in August 2009, which continues with the same playing style as the Brian Lara series of cricket games. Codemasters has released the latest \"International Cricket 2010\" on in June 2010 as a sequel to the \"Ashes Cricket 2009\". The Cricket series is moving on after Brian Lara's retirement and re-branding of the video games series."

        "text": "Roy Alexander McKay (August 1, 1933 – December 25, 1995) was an aggressive left-handed baseball pitcher born in London, Ontario, Canada, who signed with the Detroit Tigers organization in 1952 after spending much of his youth at Labatt Park, including a stint as batboy for the Ontario Baseball Association champions, the 1945 London Majors of the Intercounty Baseball League.\nIn 1953 and 1955, McKay pitched in Douglas, Georgia, United States, and Idaho Falls, Idaho, before returning to his hometown to play for the Intercounty League's London Majors where he was named the league's most valuable pitcher in 1957. In 1958, McKay's best Intercounty season as a hurler, he had a 2.79 ERA and topped the circuit in hitting batters with pitches at 16.\nOff the field, McKay was a specifications writer at General Motors Ltd., Diesel Division.\nAll-star manager.\nMcKay managed London's senior Intercounty team from 1969 to 1972, 1974–1976 and 1981–1982, winning the Intercounty title in 1969 and 1975. The Majors also won the pennant race (atop the regular season standings) in 1964, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1970 and 1975. During McKay's years as manager, he was named an Intercounty League all-star four times—1970, 1975, 1976 and 1982.\nFrom 1982 until six months before his death due to a neck injury after falling on the front porch of his Waterloo Street home in June 1995, McKay was a coach with the London Majors, owned by McKay's longtime friend and protégé, Arden Eddie.\nRoy McKay Clubhouse.\nOn August 1, 1996, the 1937 clubhouse of the London Majors (a City of London-owned designated heritage property under the \"Ontario Heritage Act\" as of 1996) was officially renamed the Roy McKay Clubhouse (prior to a London Majors' game), with a commemorative boulder and plaque placed in front of the historic structure with the help of the London Majors, the Intercounty Baseball League and the Friends of Labatt Park. A large portion of the game's proceeds were donated to the Canadian Spinal Research Organization.\n\"I would like to be remembered for being a devoted son and brother, a loving husband, a great father and a damn good friend.\"—Roy McKay, 1933-1995 \nRoy McKay's son, Alex, played for the London Majors at second base for many years in the 1980s and 1990s and also managed the team in 1996.\nThere is a crimson king maple yree planted by the McKay family just inside the front gates of Labatt Park that is a memorial tree to Roy McKay (with a plaque at its base) and McKay's uniform (jersey #16) has been retired by the London Majors."

        "text": "The Czech national cricket team, nicknamed the Lions, is the team that represents the Czech Republic in international cricket. The team is organised by the Czech Cricket Union which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2000 and an associate member in 2017. The national side did not debut until 2006, when it played a series against Austria. It made its international tournament debut in 2008, at a Twenty20 tournament in Wales, and has since participated regularly in international events, including some organised by the European Cricket Council.\nHistory.\n2008–2017.\nIn June 2008, an unofficial national team from the Czech Republic came second in an ICC supported Euro Twenty 20 tournament which took place at the Carmel &amp; District Cricket Club in Wales. They were beaten by Estonia with 3 balls remaining in the final over after beating Russia and a Cricket Board of Wales team in the group stage, and a team representing Poland in the semi-final.\nIn August 2008, the Czech Republic hosted the Prague International Twenty 20 cricket cup at their former Vypich ground. Teams from Russia, Hungary, Romania and Bulgaria joined a team representing the Czech Republic in this 2-day Twenty 20 event. Unfortunately, the team from Belarus was unable to attend due to visa complications and their place was filled by a Czech B team.\n2009: First official tournament.\nIn September 2009, the Czech Republic participated for the first time in the ICC European Division 5 Championship in Corfu, finishing a respectable third (defeating Bulgaria, Turkey and Estonia) behind Sweden and the tournament winners, Greece.\nIn May 2011, the team took part in the ICC Europe Division 3 Championship in the newly structured format. They lost narrowly to Bulgaria but three wickets apiece from Brigham Smith and Scott Page restricted Estonia to 100 all out, which the Czech team chased down thanks to an unbeaten 33 from wicket-keeper Mik Starý. Turkey and tournament winners Sweden beat the Czech team in the next two matches, but a 23-run victory over tournament hosts Slovenia in the last match helped the Czech team to finish fourth overall.\nThe highlight of 2012 was a trip to Budapest, Hungary, to face their central European rivals on Hungary's impressive cricket ground. The Czech team were comprehensively beaten in the Saturday 40-over friendly, but they came back well to win the 20-over friendly on Sunday by four runs, with young bowler Damian Kyselý taking three wickets in an impressive display. Captain Scott Page stepped up and bowled an ideal final over to seal the win. In 2013, a plan to host Hungary at the Vinoř Cricket Ground in Vinoř, Prague, was abandoned due to bad weather. The team played one T20 in Vienna, losing by 87 runs to Austria.\n2014 saw an increase in fixtures, with trips to Vienna and Dresden as well as hosting the Central Europe Cup, with T20 matches against Poland, Switzerland and Luxembourg. The match in Austria finished in another crushing defeat, this time to Austria's U25s. The trip to Dresden saw the team pick up a two-wicket win in a 50-over friendly against Dresden's 1st XI. Young bowler Oliver Matoušek picked up five wickets in his representative debut for the Lions, and Suditha Udugalage and Rahul Subash batted well to see the team home. \nThe Central Europe Cup ended with the team finishing bottom of the table, but the Czech team were the only team to beat champions Poland, and the Czech Republic also gave Switzerland a good run for their money before rain affected play, with Switzerland capitalising to take victory. A lacklustre Czech team then lost to a resurgent Luxembourg team on Sunday morning.\nThe Czech team were awarded the tournament's Spirit of Cricket award for wanting to play out the full match against Switzerland, despite being ahead on the Duckworth–Lewis method at the time.

        "title": "India men's national field hockey team",
        "text": "India men's national field hockey team represents India in international field hockey competitions, and is governed by Hockey India. The team was formerly under the control of Indian Hockey Federation. India was the first non-European team to be a part of the International Hockey Federation. India's hockey team is the most successful team ever in the Olympics, having won a total of eight gold medals – in 1928, 1932, 1936, 1948, 1952, 1956, 1964 and 1980.\nIn 1928, the team won its first Olympic gold medal and until 1960, the Indian men's team remained unbeaten in the Olympics, winning six gold medals in a row. The team had a 30–0 winning streak during this time, from their first game in 1928 until the 1960 gold medal final which they lost. India also won the World Cup in 1975. India also has the best overall performance in Olympic history with 83 victories out of the 134 matches played. They have also scored more goals in the Olympics than any other team. They are also the only team ever to win the Olympics without conceding a single goal, having done so in 1928 and 1956.\nThe men in blues are also one of the most successful teams in Asia. They have won the Asian Games four times – in 1966, 1998, 2014 and 2022. India came out on top at the Asia Cup in 2003, 2007 and in 2017. India has won 43 out of 56 matches in the Asia Cup and holds the records for most wins and best winning percentage in the competition. They are also the most successful team in the Asian Champions Trophy, winning the competition a record four times – in 2011, 2016, 2018 and in 2023. In total, India has won 29 official international titles.\nIndia is known to have an intense rivalry with Pakistan, with whom they have played in the finals of major tournaments like Olympics, World Cup, Asian Games and Asia Cup.\nHistory.\nGolden years (1928–1959).\nIndia participated at the Olympics for the first time in 1928. In the group stage, India beat Austria 6–0, Belgium 9–0 and Switzerland 5–0 without conceding a single goal. They defeated Netherlands 3–0 in the finals under the captaincy of Jaipal Singh Munda. India then went on to successfully defend their title at the 1932 Olympics with a 11–1 win over Japan and 24–1 win over United States, in that match Dhyan Chand scored 8 goals and Roop Singh scored 10 goals, This is still the largest margin of victory ever in the Olympic games even after all these years. India went on to win their third straight title at the 1936 Olympics, this time captained by legendary player Dhyan Chand himself. India stormed through the group stage by winning against Japan 9–0, Hungary 4–0 and United States 7–0. In the semi-finals they defeated France 10–0. The team went on to face Germany in the final. The match was won by India 8–1 and it still remains the biggest winning margin in an Olympic final. The Indian hockey team that won three successive Olympic titles is often regarded as one of the greatest ever to play the sport.\nThe World War II caused the cancellation of 1940 and 1944 Olympics, which ended the era of a team that dominated world hockey.\nAt the 1948 Olympics India was placed in group A and won all the three games, an 8–0 win over Austria, Argentina 9–1 and Spain 2–0. In the final India went on to face Great Britain, it was the first time India faced them. The skilled British team had already won the gold medal in 1908 and 1920, so this match was billed as a \"Battle of Champions\" and eventually India won the match 4–0. The result was a sweet one for India, which gained independence from Britain just a year before. This win is often regarded as the greatest ever moment of Indian field hockey and also all of Indian sports.\nIndia went on to win two further gold medals in 1952 and 1956, preserving its record as the most successful and dominant team at that time in the Olympics. In 1952 Olympics quarter-finals India won against Austria 4–0, Great Britain 3–1 in semi-final and defeated Netherlands 6–1 in the final. The match is famous for the five-goal magical performance of Balbir Singh Sr.,which is an Olympic record that still stands today. At the 1956 Olympics India defeated Afghanistan 14–0, United States 16–0 and Singapore 6–0 in group stage. India defeated Germany 1–0 in semi-final. In the final India faced Pakistan and won the match 1–0, which was the beginning of the biggest rivalry in field hockey. India and Pakistan again met each other in 1958 Asian Games and this time the match ended in a 0–0 draw. India also defeated Japan 8–0, South Korea 2–1 and Malaysia 6–0. But Pakistan claimed gold medal in the Asian Games by better average. It was the first time India finished runners-up in an international competition.\nLast years of dominance (1960–1980).\nAt the 1960 Olympics India started its campaign by winning against Denmark 10–0, and Netherlands 4–1, New Zealand 3–0. India defeated Australia and Great Britain in quarter-finals and semi-finals respectively. In the final it was the beginning of a new era, for the first time India lost a match at the Olympics, a 0–1 loss to Pakistan in the final which ended India's streak of six successive gold medals and 30 matches unbeaten run. Two years later India went on to win another silver medal at the 1962 Asian Games. India returned strongly at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics by registering wins against Hong Kong, Belgium, Netherlands, Malaysia and Canada and drawing with Spain and Germany. In the Semi-finals India defeated Australia 3–1, and they won against Pakistan in the final to take their seventh gold medal at the games and also went on to capture their first gold medal in 1966 Asian Games by defeating Pakistan again in the final.\nAt the 1968 Mexico Olympics, India started with a loss against New Zealand but won all of their remaining 6 matches against West Germany, Japan, Spain, Mexico, East Germany and Belgium but India went to a new low, for the first time as they were defeated in the semi-final by Australia, but they successfully claimed the bronze medal by beating West Germany. At the 1972 Olympics also the results were same as India started brightly by defeating Great Britain, Australia, Kenya, New Zealand and Mexico but drew with Netherlands and Poland. They were defeated in the semi-finals by Pakistan. In the third-place match India defeated the Netherlands to claim bronze medal.\nIndia won the bronze medal at the 1971 World Cup by virtue of a win over Kenya in the third-place playoffs. At the 1973 World Cup India defeated Pakistan in semi-finals, but lost to Netherlands in the final in penalty shoot-out after the match ended in a 2–2 draw. But at the 1975 World Cup India defeated Malaysia in the semi-final before beating arch-rivals Pakistan in the final to claim their first title. In the 1976 Olympics astro-turf hockey pitch was introduced, India struggled to maintain their dominance like they did on grass fields and for the first time ever returned home empty handed. The\n1980 Olympics was held in Moscow, India started their campaign with an 18–0 win over Tanzania followed by a 2–2 draw with both Poland and Spain respectively. Later followed by resounding wins over Cuba with a margin of 13–0 and Soviet Union by the scoreline of 4–2. India later won the gold medal for a record eighth time by defeating Spain in the final by the score of 4–3.\nDecline (1981–1997).\nAfter the 1980 Olympics success India's performance declined and the following decades resulted in a lot of ups and downs for the national team. As the team failed to win any medal in the World Cups or Olympics, but continued to be a top team in Asia and went on to win several medals in continental competitions. The 1982 World Cup was hosted by India and they finished at 5th position. The team lost to Pakistan in both 1982 Asian Games final and the inaugural Asia Cup final held in Karachi. India ended the decade by winning bronze medals at the 1986 Asian Games and 1982 Champions Trophy and silver medals at the 1985 Asia Cup and 1989 Asia Cup. Their only gold medal success in a big tournament in the decade came at the 1985 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup.\nIndia also went on to win 1991 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup and reached finals of 1994 Asia Cup but lost to South Korea in the final. The team then went on to win the 1995 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup.\nResurgence (1998–2012).\nIndia won their first continental title after 32 years at the 1998 Asian Games by defeating South Korea. The team finished fourth at the 1998 Commonwealth Games. They ended the decade by collecting bronze medal at the 1999 Asia Cup.\nIndia started the new millennium by winning the inaugural Hockey Champions Challenge by defeating South Africa in the final. In 2003 India won their first ever Asia Cup title by defeating Pakistan in the final. The same year India also clinched the first and only Afro-Asian Games title by defeating Pakistan again in the final. For the First time in their history the team did not win a medal at the Asian Games as they finished fifth at the 2006 Asian Games, but India defended their title successfully in the Asia Cup by winning the 2007 Asia Cup. In the final the team conveniently beat South Korea 7–2. India failed to qualify for 2008 Beijing Games for the first time.\nThe next Asia Cup tournament in 2009 proved to be disastrous as the team finished fifth and failed to get any medal. But the team regained momentum after winning the 2009 Sultan Azlan Shah Cup and also became the joint winners in the 2010 edition. In the 2010 World Cup, which was hosted in India, and the team finished on 8th position. In the 2010 Commonwealth Games which was again hosted by India, the national team reached the final where they were defeated 0–8 by Australia, the biggest defeat India ever suffered. India became the first ever champions of the Asian Champions Trophy after they beat Pakistan in the final of the 2011 edition. In 2012 the team finished last at the Olympics as they lost all their matches, it was disappointing given the fact that they are the most successful team ever at the Olympics. India also finished as runners-up at the 2012 Asian Champions Trophy.\n2013–present (Olympic comeback).\nAfter the disappointment in Olympics India played at the 2013 Asian Champions Trophy but could only finish at 5th place. The 2014 Asian Games became the turning point as the team defeated Pakistan to win their third gold medal.\nIn 2014–15 Hockey World League India won the bronze medal by beating Netherlands. The team reached the finals of 2016 Men's Hockey Champions Trophy but lost to Australia in penalty shootout. But bounced back by winning Asian Champions Trophy in 2016 Asian Champions Trophy by defeating Pakistan and 2017 Asia Cup by defeating Malaysia. The team also won bronze medal at the 2016–17 Hockey World League by defeating Germany 2–1.\nThe 2018 Asian Games proved little disappointing as India was the defending champions as well as the favorites to win but was surprised by Malaysia in semi-final. They later won bronze medal by defeating Pakistan 2–1. The team returned strongly by winning 2018 Asian Champions Trophy and collecting a gold medal at the 2018–19 Men's Hockey Series. India played as hosts in the 2018 Hockey World Cup and reached the quarter-finals but lost to Netherlands.\nIndian team won bronze in 2020 Tokyo Olympics after defeating Germany 5–4. This was a historic win as the Indian Hockey team won a medal in Olympics after a gap of 41 years.\nIn 2023 India made a successful run at the Asian Champions Trophy and the 2022 Asian Games Both of which India won undefeated.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following players were named for the 2023–24 FIH Pro League India leg at Bhubaneswar and Rourkela.\n\"Caps updated as of 25 February 2024, after the match against .\"\nRecent call-ups.\nThe following players have also been called up for the national team in the last 12 months.\nINJ Withdrew due to injury\nPRE Preliminary squad / standby\nRET Retired from the national team\nWD Player withdrew from the squad due to non-injury issue."

        "text": "Rodolfo \"Rudy\" Fernández Farrés (; born 4 April 1985) is a Spanish professional basketball player for Real Madrid of the Liga ACB. He is a tall swingman. He is a three-time All-EuroLeague Team selection and won the EuroLeague title in 2015, 2018 and 2023. During his stint in the National Basketball Association (NBA), he was an NBA All-Rookie Second Team member.\nFernández represents the senior Spain national team internationally. He has won two FIBA World Cup titles, in 2006 and 2019, two Olympic silver medals in 2008 and 2012, as well as a bronze medal at the 2016 Summer Olympics. He also won four EuroBasket titles in 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2022, a silver medal in 2007, and a bronze medal in 2013. Fernández earned an All-EuroBasket Team selection in 2009.\nProfessional career.\nJoventut (2002–2008).\nRudy Fernández won the 2005 and 2007 Catalan Tournaments, the 2006 FIBA EuroChallenge championship, the 2008 Spanish King's Cup title, and the 2008 EuroCup championship, while playing with DKV Joventut of the Spanish ACB League.\nHe also won numerous personal awards while playing with DKV Joventut, such as the 2004 Spanish King's Cup MVP, the 2006 FIBA EuroChallenge Final Four MVP, the EuroLeague 2006–07 season's Rising Star award, the 2008 Spanish King's Cup MVP, the 2008 EuroCup Finals MVP, and the 2007 Catalan Tournament Final MVP.\nHe was also named the 2006 FIBA Europe Young Player of the Year. In July 2007, his contract with Joventut was extended through the year 2011, however his contract was bought out early in the year 2008 so that he could join the NBA. On his exit out of the club he paid tribute to his DKV coach, Aíto García Reneses, \"All I know of basketball is thanks to Aíto García Reneses\", he said.\nPortland Trail Blazers (2008–2011).\nOn 28 June 2007 Fernández was taken 24th overall in the NBA draft by the Phoenix Suns, who subsequently traded his draft rights along with James Jones to the Portland Trail Blazers for cash. Rudy Fernández announced at a press conference on Friday 6 June 2008 that he would leave DKV Joventut to join the Portland Trail Blazers for the 2008–09 NBA season, and he signed a contract with the Blazers on 1 July. \"They [Portland] have shown a lot of interest in getting me and have assured me that I will be an important part in the team\", he said. Fernández joined the NBA team on 22 September 2008. He became the eighth Spaniard to play in the NBA. For the 2008–09 NBA season he joined several other fellow Spaniards in the league that included Pau and Marc Gasol, Jose Calderón, and Trail Blazers teammate Sergio Rodríguez. He entered the NBA following his participation with the Spain national team at the 2008 Olympic basketball tournament in Beijing, China.\nFernández played in his first regular-season NBA game on 28 October 2008, coming off the bench to score 16 points in a 96–76 Portland loss to the Los Angeles Lakers. On 12 November 2008 Rudy scored 25 points in 29 minutes against the Miami Heat, including 8 of 8 from the free throw line adding to his already 92% FT shooting to set a new NBA career high. On 18 January 2009 it was announced that Fernández had won the fan voting and was picked the fourth dunker to go to the NBA Slam Dunk Contest as part of the 2009 All-Star Weekend. During the contest, he paid tribute to the late Trail Blazer Fernando Martín by wearing his #10 jersey. Fernández was eliminated in the first round of the competition, after what some thought was biased judging.\nOn 9 March 2009, against the Los Angeles Lakers, Fernández was taken off the court in a stretcher after Trevor Ariza hit him on the head on a fastbreak attempt. Fernández was alert and conscious when leaving the court with full movement of his extremities, however, he was taken to the hospital due to chest pain. He was released from the hospital the next day with a bruised chest and a right hip pointer.\nFernández was selected to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team on 30 April 2009. He set NBA rookie records for number of three-point field goals made (159), hitting a three-point field goal in 33 consecutive games, and making a three-pointer in his first 20 career NBA games.\nOn 16 October 2009 Blazers announced that they had exercised the third year of their option on Fernández's contract, keeping him with the team through the 2010–11 season.\nIn December 2009, Fernández underwent microdiscectomy surgery for a herniated disc that was causing leg pain.\nOn 20 August 2010 Fernández was fined $25,000 for \"public statements detrimental to the NBA,\" a day after his agent publicly demanded a trade from the Blazers. On 17 December 2010 he hit 9-of-15 shots and four 3-pointers for a career-high 26 points with six assists in a 107–102 win against Minnesota. Fernandez along with teammate Patty Mills donated 50% of the proceeds from their jerseys sales, throughout the month of January, to help those affected by the floods in Australia. Fernández had a season-high eight assists on January 22 to go with 11 points, six rebounds and two steals in 37 minutes off the bench as a PG in the 97–92 win against Indiana. Disappointed Fernández and his team, for the third consecutive time, exited the first round of the playoffs, this time against the Dallas Mavericks. Fernández struggled offensively for a good part of the year, but his improved play in other areas of the game has earned him praise from his peers. Blazers head coach Nate McMillan, who isn't known to hand out compliments easily, singled out his defensive play in the second half of Game 4 against the Mavericks as the key to the 84–82 win.\nReal Madrid (2011).\nOn 21 September 2011 Fernández signed a one-year contract with the Liga ACB team Real Madrid, valid only while a new NBA collective bargaining agreement remained under negotiation. Fernández signed for a reported salary of 2.7 million euros net income per season, the largest contract in Spanish league history, at that time. His deal also gave him the option to return to Real when his NBA contract ended.\nDenver Nuggets (2011–2012).\nDuring the 2011 NBA Draft Rudy Fernández was traded to the Mavericks in a three-team trade. However, he never played for the Mavericks, as he was traded with Corey Brewer to the Denver Nuggets on 13 December 2011. The Mavericks received a second-round draft pick and a traded player exception.\nHe played 31 games for Denver before suffering a season-ending back injury. In July 2012, Fernández announced he would not return to the NBA, opting for a 3-year deal with Real Madrid Baloncesto.\nReturn to Real Madrid (2012–present).\nOn 4 July 2012 Fernández returned to Real Madrid by signing a three-year deal worth 9 million euros net income. In May 2014, alongside his teammate Sergio Rodríguez, he was named to the All-EuroLeague First Team of the EuroLeague, the second consecutive in his career.\nOn 14 August 2014 he signed a three-year extension with Real Madrid, to stay in the club until 2018. In May 2015, he was chosen to the All-EuroLeague Second Team for his performance during the season. Real Madrid won the EuroLeague 2014–15 season championship, after defeating Olympiacos, by a score of 78–59 in the final game. Real Madrid finished the season winning the Spanish League 2014–15 season championship, after a 3–0 series sweep in the ACB finals against Barcelona. With that trophy, they finished the season having won the triple crown.\nIn May 2018, Real Madrid won the 2017–18 EuroLeague championship, after defeating Fenerbahçe Doğuş in the final game with 85–80. Over 30 EuroLeague games, Fernández averaged 7.5 points, 2.6 assists and 2.4 rebounds per game. One month later, the club won the Spanish league after a 3–1 series win against Baskonia. Fernández was named MVP of the finals.\nOn 2 July 2018 he signed a two-year extension with Real Madrid, to stay in the club until 2020.\nNational team career.\nFernández has been participating in international basketball competitions since he was sixteen years old. He played at the FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship and at the FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship with the Spain national junior teams.\nAs a member of the senior Spain national team, Fernández competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics, averaging 5.1 points per game, in 10.6 minutes per game. The next year, he played at the EuroBasket 2005, but his statistics were worse: 2.7 points per game, in 16.3 minutes, with a 31.6% FG% His third appearance with Spain's senior national team was at the 2006 FIBA World Championship, where he became an important player for the Spanish team, and contributed with 9.1 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 1.4 steals per game, to help his team win a gold medal.\nHe also played at the EuroBasket 2007, where Spain won the tournament's silver medal. During this tournament, Rudy averaged 9.9 points in 20.3 minutes per game. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, Spain lost to Team USA in the gold medal match. Fernández scored 22 points in 18 minutes of play, with 5 three-point goals, and completed a dunk over Dwight Howard that ESPN sportswriter Bill Simmons described as \"hellacious\". During the Olympics, Fernández had the following stats: 13.1 points, 3.5 rebounds, and 2.1 assists, in 22.3 minutes per game.\nThe EuroBasket 2009 in Poland was his sixth consecutive appearance with the Spain national team. Spain won its inaugural gold medal in a European Championship, and Fernández averaged 13.2 points, 3.5 rebounds, 2.1 assists, and 2.1 steals per game, in 28.4 minutes, and was named to the All-Tournament Team.\nIn the 2010 FIBA World Championship, Fernández averaged 15.6 points, 6.0 rebounds, 1.7 assists, and 1.8 steals per game, but Spain only took sixth place in the tournament. Fernández then participated in EuroBasket 2011, where Spain won the gold medal, and clinched a spot in the 2012 Summer Olympics, where he won a silver medal with Spain. He also played at EuroBasket 2013, where he won a bronze medal, at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup, at EuroBasket 2015, where he won a gold medal, at the 2016 Summer Olympics, where he won a bronze medal, at the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup, where he won a gold medal, at the 2020 Summer Olympics, and at the EuroBasket 2022, where he won a gold medal.\nPersonal life.\nFernández married Helen Lindes, his girlfriend of three years, on 4 July 2015. They live in Pozuelo de Alarcón, on the outskirts of Madrid. His older sister, Marta Fernández, played in the WNBA for the Los Angeles Sparks in 2007."

The Act was enacted in response to widespread abuse of boxers by means of exploitation, rigged rankings, and rigged matches.\nThe United States Congress noted through research that there were a number of problems with the sport of boxing which needed to be changed to ensure the safety and protection of professional boxers. Listed are a number of discoveries made by Congress:\nThe Act received several criticisms. One criticism was that the Act provides rules but leaves the enforcement of these rules to the state without defined guidelines. Other criticism stems from the belief that Congress has no purpose regulating the boxing industry, as there is no precedent of Congress regulating any other sport.\nIn May 2016, a bill was introduced to Congress by politician and former mixed martial artist Markwayne Mullin, to extend the Ali Act to mixed martial arts."

        "text": "Otago University Rowing Club is a rowing club affiliated with the University of Otago, New Zealand and was formed in 1929 to provide students of the university the opportunity to compete against other universities in New Zealand. This remains the main aim of the club, although limited membership is now available for persons not studying at the University of Otago.\nHistory.\nOtago University Rowing Club was established on 16 April 1929. The first President, Professor D W Carmalt Jones, continued until 1944. Carmalt Jones had rowed for Corpus Christi College, Oxford University, and captained the College Eight in 1898. \nHe loved rowing and believed the combination of disciplined exercise and teamwork was invaluable to the developing young man. His sonnet, \"Summer Eights\", celebrates rowing. \nThe Club started rowing from the Otago Rowing Club's Kitchener St shed, which in 2014 still stands. In 1931 the Club moved to the North End Boating Club which is on the Harbour-side a short walk from the University, and has since built a new location on the North End of Magnet St, purpose built through OUSA (Otago University Students Association) funding for sole use by university rowers. The Club colours, a Cambridge Blue singlet with a 4-inch gold band were adopted in 1931.\nThe Club had 60 members in the mid 1930s. The strong relationship with North End was seen in the joint membership of coaches, Glengarry, Eggers and Rennick. The first Club Eight, purchased in 1939, was named \"Carmalt Jones\" to honour the Club President. In this boat Otago won the Hebberley Shield, awarded to the winners of the New Zealand University Men's Open Eight on Easter Saturday 1939 on the Otago Harbour. \nAt the Tournament Ball Carmalt Jones presented the Shield, the first time it had been competed for. The Hebberley Shield is now the most desired prize in New Zealand University Rowing.\nNotable members.\nMembers of the Club represent New Zealand at many levels, including Under 23, Elite and New Zealand University. In 2009, an Eight competed in China.\nScullers, Elyse Fraser and Fergus Fauvel competed at the World University Rowing Championships in August 2010. Fauvel was placed fifth in the men's Sculls. This year Bryce Abernethy (Former NZU21 rower) and Lisa Owen (Former NZU23 rower) are competing in the World University Rowing Championships.\nThe Club Coach in 2010, Grant Craies, is a former Cambridge University coach.\nNathan Cohen is a two-time world champion and Olympic champion rower. Current members Alistar Bond and Fiona Bourke are part of the New Zealand Elite Team Competing in the World Rowing Championships in Amsterdam. Alumni Rowers Rebecca Scown and Louise Trappitt are also competing.\nFacilities.\nToday the Club is housed in the Otago University Students Association (OUSA) Aquatic Centre, which is at the end of Magnet Street Dunedin. The Centre has a large boat bay for the Club's fleet of boats and an indoor rowing tank – the only one of its kind in New Zealand, as well as 24 Concept II and 4 row-perfect ergometers, 4 spin bikes and also boasts a large function centre which is used for both functions and as a training space.\nAwards.\nThe Club held the Hebberley Shield from 2002 to 2009, a record setting run, and now again in 2013–2014."

        "title": "Comparison of rugby league and rugby union",
        "text": "The team sports rugby union and rugby league have shared origins and thus many similarities.\nInitially, following the 1895 split in rugby football, rugby union and rugby league differed in administration only. Soon, however, the rules of rugby league were modified, resulting in two distinctly different forms of rugby. \nAfter 100 years, in 1995 rugby union joined rugby league and most other forms of football as an openly professional sport.\nThe inherent similarities between rugby union and rugby league have at times led to the possibility of a merger of the two variants and experimental hybrid games have been played that use a mix of the two sports' rules.\nHistory.\nRugby union was originally referred to as rugby football. During the early development of rugby football different schools used different rules, on many occasions agreeing upon them shortly before commencement of the game. In 1871, English clubs met to form the Rugby Football Union (RFU). Rugby football spread to Australia and New Zealand, with games being played in the early-to-mid-nineteenth century.\nIn 1892, charges of professionalism were laid against Yorkshire clubs after they compensated players for missing work. A proposal to pay players up to six shillings when they missed work because of match commitments was voted down by the RFU. On 27 August 1895, prominent Lancashire clubs declared that they would support their Yorkshire colleagues in their proposal to form a professional organization and the Northern Rugby Football Union, usually called the Northern Union (NU), was formed. The rugby union authorities issued sanctions against clubs, players and officials involved in the offshoot group, including amateurs who played with or against Northern Union sides. The RFU also banned any player that played rugby league from playing rugby union that lasted until 1995. After the schism the separate codes were named \"rugby union\" for the RFU code and \"rugby league\" for the NU code.\nIn 1906, All Black George William Smith joined with Albert Henry Baskerville to form a team of professional rugby players. George Smith cabled a friend in Sydney and three professional matches were arranged between a New South Wales rugby team before continuing onto the UK. This game was played under the rugby union laws and it was not until the team, nicknamed the All Golds, arrived in Leeds that they learnt the new Northern Union laws. Meanwhile, in Sydney a meeting was organised to look at forming a professional rugby competition in Australia. The meeting resolved that a \"New South Wales Rugby Football League\" (NSWRFL) should be formed, to play the Northern Union rules. The first season of the NSWRFL competition was played in 1908, and has continued to be played every year since.\nDuring rugby league's 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain, the Northern Rugby Football Union tried to arrange a match in Paris, but opposition from the Rugby Football Union-aligned French Rugby Federation made it impossible. In France rugby league split from rugby union in the 1930s. In 1948 the French instigated the formation of the International Rugby League Board as the world governing body for rugby league. France, New Zealand, Britain and Australia (who joined a few months later) were the founding countries. The International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) had formed prior to the schism in 1886 and remained the international governing body for rugby union, although it originally only consisted of England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. Australia, New Zealand and South Africa joined the IRFB in 1948, France in 1978 and Argentina, Canada, Italy and Japan in 1991.\nOn 26 August 1995 the IRFB, now known as World Rugby, declared rugby union an \"open\" game and thus removed all restrictions on payments or benefits to those connected with the game. This came after rugby league accused rugby union of \"shamateurism\" to Inland Revenue in the UK and due to Kerry Packer signing top union players to professional contracts in secret for a breakaway union competition. According to \"The New York Times\" at the time:\nThirteen-man rugby league has shown itself to be a faster, more open game of better athletes than the other code. Rugby union is trying to negotiate its own escape from amateurism, with some officials admitting that the game is too slow, the laws too convoluted to attract a larger TV following.\nNaming.\nAlthough both rugby codes are forms of football, in many places, it could cause confusion as \"football\" is understood to mean soccer, gridiron football, Gaelic football or Australian rules football depending on the country (or indeed region of the country). In much of the rugby union-playing world, the sport of rugby league is infrequently played and rugby union is commonly known simply as \"rugby\"; in countries where both codes are played, there is a need to distinguish between the codes of rugby.\nIn the United Kingdom, rugby union or rugby league fans rarely refer to their sport as \"football\" as in most cases this would refer to association football. Across the United Kingdom, rugby union is usually referred to simply as 'rugby' but in the North of England, the word 'rugby' could refer to either sport, but usually means \"rugby league\". The nickname \"rugger\", which developed in England's elite schools, almost always refers to rugby union.\nIn Australia and New Zealand, rugby league is usually known as \"league\" or \"football\" with the latter term potentially confusing as Australian rules football and association football could also be called football. Rugby union is often simply referred to as \"rugby\" without the ambiguity that this term carries in the UK.\nIn France, rugby union is called \"rugby à quinze\" (rugby with 15) or simply \"rugby\", whilst rugby league is known as \"rugby à treize\" (rugby with 13) or \"jeu à treize\" (game with 13).\nGameplay.\nSince the 1895 schism, changes have taken place to the laws of both rugby union and rugby league football so that now they are distinct sports. The laws of rugby league football have been gradually changed with the aim of creating a faster, more spectator-friendly sport. Player numbers were reduced to thirteen a side, creating more space for attacking play, and rucks and mauls were replaced with a play-the-ball restart. Changes to the laws of rugby union have been less extreme, although there have been adjustments in scoring as the game became more try-orientated rather than focusing on goals. In 2009, major law changes were implemented with the aim of making union simpler and more open. Rugby league historian Tony Collins has written that since turning professional in the mid-1990s, rugby union has increasingly borrowed techniques and tactics from rugby league.\nRugby union has more laws than rugby league and it has been described as being a more complex game. Rugby league in turn has been described as a simpler game that is easier for spectators to understand. Mat Rogers, an Australian dual-code rugby international player, has said \"Rugby [union] is very complicated and rugby league is much more simple in comparison\". England's Chris Ashton, also a dual international, has said that union has \"more of a tactical side, more that can happen in a game\". Ireland's Tom Court has said \"Rugby Union is a complex game with certain closed skills like scrummaging and line-out lifting and rugby league requires a higher level of fitness to compete at the highest level\".\nSimilarities between the two codes.\nThe two forms of rugby share the same basic rules of the game and use a similar-shaped ovoid ball. The aim is to score more points through tries, conversions, penalty goals and drop goals than the opposition within the 80 minutes of play.\nGoals are scored when the ball is kicked between the two posts and over the cross-bar, either during open play or as the result of a penalty. A try is scored when the ball is touched down on or beyond the defending team's goal-line. The try-scoring side is given the chance to score two additional points by kicking a conversion similar to a penalty goal attempt from a point along a line which is parallel to the sideline at the same distance from the sideline as the place where the try had been scored.\nThe ball can be taken forward in three ways—by kicking, by a player running with it, or as the result of a set-piece. The ball can be passed from hand to hand between teammates in a backward or sideways direction; it may not be passed forwards although it can be kicked forwards. Dropping the ball in a forwards direction results in a scrum, a set-piece that restarts the game, except on the sixth tackle in league where the game restarts with a handover to the opposition.\nOnly the player holding the ball may be tackled. A rugby tackle is an attempt to bring the ball carrier to the ground or to stop his forward progress. Play restarts with the ball being transferred to another player.\nThe playing positions are divided into \"backs\"—generally faster and more mobile who score most of the points, and the larger, stronger \"forwards\" who are involved in the more physical aspects of rugby and generally do more tackling.\nPossession.\nA big difference in gameplay between the two games is that rugby league has shed from its laws several opportunities for possession to be contested that rugby union has retained: contesting the ball after the tackle, on the ground in rucks and through mauls. When the ball goes into touch, possession in rugby union is contested through a line-out, while in rugby league a scrum restarts play. The lesser focus on contesting possession means there are fewer stoppages of play in rugby league, with the ball typically in play for 50 out of the 80 minutes compared to around 35 for professional rugby union. As the ball is in play more and there are fewer players (13 compared to 15) to cover the field it has been implied that rugby league is the more physically demanding sport.\nIn union the attacking team can hold onto and use the ball for as long as they are able, while the opposition's aim is to take possession of the ball from them. In league each team can be tackled six times before handing over possession; moreover, the action stops after each successful tackle (i.e., the ball is not contested after a tackle). After being tackled five times, the attacking team will usually kick the ball either in an attacking kick or for territory. As the ball can only be contested during a one on one tackle in league there is less scope for a turnover to occur than in rugby union. A study commissioned by the IRB found that between the years 2002 and 2004 possession was retained by the attacking team in 13 out of 14 tackles in rugby union. Collins has argued that the six tackle rule in rugby league offers a more even distribution of possession despite fewer opportunities to contest it. In both games the attacking team loses possession if they drop or pass the ball forward, which results in a scrum being awarded to the defending team.\nIn union possession can also be contested at line-outs (played after the ball has gone into touch) and scrums. In the same study it was found that the team with the ball at a scrum regained possession 90 per cent of the time, while the team with the ball at a lineout regained possession 80 per cent of the time. League does not have a lineout, but does utilise a scrum to restart play. It is uncommon for modern rugby league scrums to be contested, with the side awarded the scrum almost always gaining possession. Possession can also be contested following kicks to restart play from the halfway, 22 metre in both games (and from the goal line in league). Generally league restarts are likely to go for distance unless possession is needed quickly (usually if a team is behind with very little time left to play). Union restarts are more likely to be short to allow players to contest possession in the air.\nPossession may change the same ways in both games:\nPossession may change in rugby league in a number of unique ways:\nPossession may change in rugby union in a number of unique ways\nTackling.\nIn both games tackling is permitted to either bring down the player in possession of the ball or prevent him from making forward progress. Tackling or interfering with a player who is not in possession of the ball is not permitted. Tripping with the leg is not allowed in either code. However, in rugby league, if a tackling player has both hands on the ball carrier, he is allowed to use his legs to bring him to ground.\nIn rugby league, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the elbow of the arm holding the ball touches the ground, or the player is held in an upright tackle. The ball cannot be further advanced and a play-the-ball or handover must take place. In rugby union, a tackle is deemed to be complete when the player in possession is held on the ground; that player must play the ball (either releasing it, passing it, or if over the try line grounding the ball) immediately. In rugby league a play the ball takes place after each tackle. In rugby union, play does not stop when a player is forced to the ground in a tackle, as the tackled player must immediately play the ball, and the tackler must roll away, which will generally mean a ruck will form.\nThe laws of rugby league specifically outlaw the so-called \"voluntary tackle\": players are not allowed to go to ground unless they are effectively tackled by an opponent, though in practice this rule is rarely applied. There was no equivalent law in rugby union, in the past going to ground with the ball and protecting it was practised, but in the modern game deliberately falling on the ground to gain an advantage is outlawed by Law 14: \"The game is to be played by players who are on their feet. A player must not make the ball unplayable by falling down.\" A player who falls to ground with the ball or on it must immediately release or pass the ball, or get up with it.\nScoring.\nUnion and league have the same ways of scoring, but there are significant differences in the points awarded, and a few minor differences in the laws governing the scoring of tries.\nThe try is the main way of scoring in both codes; there are some subtle differences between the two codes, but the most obvious difference is that a try is worth 5 points in rugby union and 4 points in rugby league. In both games, a conversion following a try is worth 2 points. A player tackled just short of the try-line in rugby union can legitimately reach across it and place the ball down for a try. This is not allowed in rugby league unless the momentum of the player continues to take him over the line in one continuous movement. If the tackle is complete, such a move would constitute a \"double movement\" and the try would be disallowed.\nA drop goal is worth 3 points in union and 1 in league. A penalty goal is worth 3 points in union and 2 points in league. Due to the increased prevalence of infringements during contesting of the ball, penalties are a much more common occurrence in union than in league. This, combined with the higher number of points with a successful penalty conversion, results in penalties forming a considerably higher percentage of total points in a match of Rugby Union.\nLaws.\nUse of a penalty box (or \"sin bin\") was introduced by rugby league in 1980. Rugby union had been experimenting with the same concept since 1979, although it was not formally sanctioned until 2001.\nVideo referee technology was first used for rugby league in 1996 and for rugby union in 2001.\nIn rugby league the ball may be thrown or knocked out of play deliberately, while in union those are penalty offences. Kicking the ball out of play is legal in both codes.\nWhen taking free or penalty kicks with a \"tap and go\" option, rugby league permits a stylised kick with the ball being tapped against the foot or lower leg while union requires the ball to leave the hands of the kicker. This difference in emphasis on a relatively trivial phase of play can be seen as indicative of the core differences between the games. In league, the kick is stylised as its purpose is to restart the game and to move to the run and tackle main play as quickly as possible. In union, where \"every\" phase of play has some element of competition, the trivial need to release the ball at any kick can result in a fumble that may give the opposition a chance to either contest possession or, if \"knocked-on\", will cause them to be awarded a scrum.\nPitch.\nA rugby league pitch is between 112 and 122 metres long by 68 metres wide. The distance between try-lines is always 100 metres. There are lines going across the field which mark every ten metres. An in-goal area extends six to eleven metres beyond each goal line. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: drop goal, penalty and conversion.\nA rugby union pitch is between 106 and 144 metres long by 68 to 70 metres wide. The length from try line to try line varies between 94 and 100 metres, with a distance of 6 to 22 metres between the goal and dead-ball lines. Lines are painted at the dead-ball line, goal line, 22-metre line, 10-metre line (broken line) and halfway. Lines are also located 5 metres away from the goal line and touchline and 15 metres away from the touchline. At the goal line is a set of goal posts in the shape of the letter 'H', used for other forms of point scoring: drop goal, penalty and conversion.\nThe dimensions of a rugby league pitch fit within the parameters of a rugby union pitch. Since World Rugby allowed professionalism in 1995, it has been possible for clubs to share facilities, including pitches. One such example was Leeds Rhinos and Yorkshire Carnegie, both part of the Leeds Rugby group, who shared Headingley Stadium.\nPlayers.\nA maximum of 15 players can play rugby union at any one time whereas rugby league permits 13 players. In both games, the positions are divided into \"backs\" and \"forwards\".\nMany of the positions have similar names but in practice are very different. The position known as 'flanker' is not in rugby league; however the second row in rugby league are loose like the flankers in rugby union while the lock / loose forward in rugby league is similar to the number 8 in rugby union. In the backs, rugby league centres are split into left and right centre rather than inside and outside centres.\nThe reduction in the importance of the scrum and the removal of the line-out from rugby league, has meant it is a faster free flowing game. Very different skill sets and body types needed for the different positions has become more obvious as union players specialise more. For instance, props and hookers in rugby union tend to be among the physically strongest and heaviest players with high levels of scrummaging and mauling skills, but traditionally with limited speed and ball-handling skills. In rugby league, props are physically big, straight running forwards whose job it is to set the platform and get the go forward while still possessing agility and good ball handling skills. Locks in union tend to be very tall and high jumpers, as this helps at line-outs; while as this is not a necessity for league; the two second rowers and the loose forward / lock are mobile with speed across the park who can off-load on attack and contain and enforce on defence. They are similar to the loose forward trio of flankers and number eight in rugby union. Depending on their speed and ball playing skills, lock forwards in rugby league can generally play as both a forward and as an extra five-eight.\nScrum-half is a specialized position in rugby union and similar to the hooker in league: the number 9 initiates most moves by his or her team and must be an excellent passer of the ball in rugby union as with league. In rugby league any player can act from dummy half, however, in the professional modern game it is a specialised job for the hooker to instigate and direct the forward platform. He must also be able to probe with a running and varied kicking game from dummy half while still possessing strong and effective tackling.\nThe similarity between the two games has meant that players can switch between the two codes. League initially recruited big name players from union, like Herbert \"Dally\" Messenger in 1907, and the RFU responded by banning any player that played rugby league for life. A push into converting union players to rugby league, such as All Blacks John Gallagher, Frano Botica, Matthew Ridge and Va'aiga Tuigamala, occurred during the late 1980s and into the 1990s. When rugby union became professional league players were allowed to play for rugby union teams, leading to a reversal in cross-code switching. Gallagher, Botica and Tuigamala returned to union, while leading league players such as Jason Robinson, Wendell Sailor, Mat Rogers, Lote Tuqiri, Henry Paul and Iestyn Harris, took up rugby union contracts. Sailor, Rogers, Tuqiri, Paul and Harris subsequently switched back to rugby league. Players who play international rugby in both codes are known as dual-code internationals.\nCross-code games.\nIn 1909, when the new \"Northern Union\" code was still in its infancy, a match between the Kangaroos and the Wallabies was played before a crowd of around 20,000, with the rugby league side winning, 29–26. With the wartime Emergency League suspended, Leeds Rugby League reverted to rugby union during World War I to play a one-off challenge game against the Royal Navy Depot from Plymouth in 1917. This was precursor to the following Christmas when two Challenge games were organised between the two sides but this time with one of each code. The Navy won the union game, 9–3, on Christmas Eve but proved equally adept at league recording a 24–3 win on 28 December. During World War II, the RFU relaxed its restrictions on rugby league footballers playing rugby union. In 1943, a Northern Command army rugby league side defeated a Northern Command union side, 18–11, at Headingley under rugby union laws. The following year a Combined Services rugby league side beat a Combined Services union side, 15–10, at Bradford again at rugby union. These were the only league v union matches played until 1996.\nWith both sports becoming professional matches between union and league teams have been played. In May 1996, Bath Rugby and Wigan RLFC, who were then England's top union and league sides respectively, made history by playing against each other at both codes of rugby. Wigan won, 82–6, in the first match, played under league rules, and lost the second, 44–19, under union rules. Since then other games have been played between union and league teams using the laws of one of the codes, or in some cases using a different set of laws for each half.\nSince the two match series in 1996, there has only been one similar endeavour to bring together union and league. In January 2003, St Helens rugby league took on Sale rugby union in a single game played at Knowsley Road, intended to have one half under league rules and the other under union rules. Unlike Bath, who were to all intents and purposes still the amateur side they had been, Sale had the benefit of almost a decade of professionalism to improve both strength and fitness that was necessary for them to adapt to the constant tackling required in rugby league. Sale prevailed against St Helens in front of a fierce St Helens home crowd at Knowsley Road, winning the match 41–39.\nDemographics.\nTraditionally, the two rugbys have been seen as divided along class lines, with union associated more with the middle class, and league with the working class. One of the main reasons for the split was union's enforcement of the amateur principle, meaning that working class players could not afford to take time off work to play the sport.\nIn England, rugby union is widely regarded as an \"establishment\" sport, played mostly by members of the upper and middle classes. For example, many students at public schools play rugby union. In contrast, rugby league has traditionally been seen as a working class pursuit.\nIn Wales, rugby union is associated with small village teams which consisted of coal miners and other industrial workers playing on their days off.\nIn Australia, the two codes were also strongly divided down class lines. Support for both codes is concentrated in New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. The same perceived class barrier as exists between the two games in England also occurs in these states, fostered by rugby union's prominence and support at private schools.\nIn New Zealand, rugby union is played throughout the whole country where as rugby league is still considered to be a lower class game by many, or a game for \"westies\" referring to lower class western suburbs of Auckland and more recently the poorer southern Auckland where the game is popular. \nIn France, rugby union is widely played and has a strong tradition in the Basque, Occitan, and Catalan areas along the border regions between Spain and France. It rivals the popularity of association football. Rugby league has historically been played in much the same region. \nBall.\nThe balls for rugby are very similar, both a prolate spheroid shaped ball. Rugby league balls are similar in size to Rugby union balls, but are more pointed at the edges. Rugby balls are noticeably larger than a Canadian / American football, and do not have ties for grabbing. Rather than being made of coarse leather as in gridiron, rugby balls are made with a smoother synthetic finish.\nFinance and scale.\nIn the UK, the \"two codes\" of rugby are very different in scale and turnover. The turnover of the RFL was reported as £19m in 2014. For comparison, the turnover of the Rugby Football Union in 2014 was £150m. The number of rugby union players in England is 1.99 million (predominantly school and children's teams following a RFU drive to increase participation) but which includes 131,000 senior male players. The number of players participating in any capacity in Rugby League in England (including wheelchair users) is about 100,000.\nIn Australia, rugby league had 1,430,367 participants in the sport (including school clinics) and 167,533 registered players in 2021. The Australian Rugby League Commission reported a gross revenue of $185,668,873 and a gross profit of $14,675,845 in the 2022 financial year. Rugby Union in 2012 had 323,115 participants, including 50,000 registered juniors. The ARU in 2012 had gross revenues of $96.6m, but had a net deficit of $8.3m. A significant portion of Rugby Union's revenue is derived from the national team touring overseas and visiting tours, while Rugby League's is largely generated by its strong domestic league.\nThe number of rugby union players in New Zealand is estimated to be 129,000, with 95,721 playing rugby league.\nRugby union generally has a broader reach around the world, largely due to the unrestricted spread of the game across commonwealth countries, promulgated by British armed forces, during a time when the armed forces banned rugby league in the early 20th century. For example, it is a popular sport in a number of countries such as South Africa and Argentina.\nInternational competitions.\nSix Nations and The Rugby Championship.\nThe oldest international rugby union competition is the Six Nations Championship, the men’s version, starting in 1883 with games played between England, Wales, Ireland and Scotland. France joined in 1910 and Italy in 2000. The women’s version of the Six Nations Championship was inaugurated, 2 years after the men’s version. In 1996 the Southern Hemisphere teams of South Africa, Australia and New Zealand started their own annual international competition known as the Tri Nations; it adopted its current name of The Rugby Championship when Argentina joined in 2012.\nRugby Union Sevens at the Summer Olympics and the Commonwealth Games.\nRugby union was previously a medal sport at four Olympic games, in Paris (1900 and 1924), London (1908) and Antwerp (1920), and returned to the Olympics in 2016 in the sevens form. Rugby union sevens is a core event at both the Commonwealth Games and the Asian Games.\nRugby League Four Nations.\nThe major annual international competition in rugby league is the Four Nations, first played in 1999. It originally involved Britain, Australia and New Zealand before expanding to include a fourth invited nation in 2009.\nRugby League World Cup.\nRugby league introduced its World Cup for men in 1954 and it has been held intermittently since, in various formats, Great Britain won the inaugural men’s version of the Rugby League World Cup, while the women’s version of the Rugby League World Cup was first played in 2000 and New Zealand won the inaugural women’s version of the Rugby League World Cup.\nRugby Union World Cup.\nRugby union's first World Cup for men was held in 1987 and both are contested every four years, New Zealand won the inaugural men’s version of the Rugby Union World Cup. The women’s version of the Rugby Union World Cup was first played in 1991, which are held every four years alternating with the men’s version, to avoid clashing with other sporting events: Rugby 7s at both the Commonwealth Games and the Summer Olympics. The United States won the inaugural women’s version of the Rugby Union World Cup.\nRugby League Nines.\nThere is a newer version of the Rugby League tournament, which is known as the Rugby League Nines. The inaugural Rugby League Nines World Cup was launched in 2019. Australia won the men’s version of the Rugby League Nines World Cup while New Zealand won the women’s version."

        "title": "Rugby League Amateur Four Nations",
        "text": "The Amateur Four Nations was a rugby league competition contested annually by Wales A, Ireland A, Scotland A and England A. The teams from the Celtic nations would pick players from their domestic competitions, while England's squad would be picked from teams in the Rugby League Conference. Players would also come from university teams and the armed forces. The competition, sometimes referred to as the Four Nations Championship, had previously been sponsored by Cheltenham Regency and Parkhouse Recruitment and Skanska. In 2014 the tournament was renamed the Celtic Nations Cup following England's withdrawal\nHistory.\nFriendly matches between A sides were played between 1998 and 2001 with Scotland facing Wales twice and Ireland three times and Wales taking on England once.\nThe success of these one-off friendly internationals saw the advent of the first Home Nations Championship in 2002.\nUntil the final match between Wales and England at Cheltenham, the tournament was low-key and had little publicity. But the England v Wales match received unprecedented national coverage with highlights on Sky Sports and resulted in a shock Wales win.\nWales would continue to \"shock\" for the next four years as they continued to win the title, only losing two matches in this period. It took the introduction of the Crusaders to weaken the Wales side and allow England to win the title for the first time in 2006. Even then Wales only lost by two penalties and travelled with a weakened injury-laden side.\nThe tournament has been successful in introducing new players to international rugby league in particular with the Celtic nations where some players have progressed to the senior side and also into semi-professional rugby league teams.\nResults and Tables.\n2002.\n15 June -

        "title": "Pakistan women's national cricket team",
        "text": "The Pakistan women's national cricket team (), also known as Green Shirts or Women in Green, represents Pakistan in international women's cricket. One of ten teams competing in the ICC Women's Championship (the highest level of international women's cricket), the team is organised by the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC).\nPakistan made its One Day International (ODI) debut in early 1997 against New Zealand, and later in the year played in the 1997 World Cup in India. The team's inaugural Test match came against Sri Lanka in April 1998. In its early years, Pakistan was one of the least competitive of the top-level women's teams, and after its inaugural appearance in 1997, did not qualify for another World Cup until the 2009 event in Australia. However, the team has played in all eight editions of the ICC Women's T20 World Cup to date, and has also participated in the Women's Asia Cup and the Asian Games cricket tournament.\nThe increase in terrorism as a result of the war on terror led to a stagnation of foreign teams touring Pakistan in the late 2000s and early 2010s. However, due to a decrease in terrorism in Pakistan over the past few years, as well as an increase in security, Bangladesh (twice), West Indies, Sri Lanka, Ireland, and South Africa have toured Pakistan since 2015.\nHistory.\n1990s.\nThe concept of women's cricket was first introduced in Pakistan by two sisters, Shaiza and Sharmeen Khan, in 1996. In conservative Pakistan, the creation of a Pakistan women`s cricket team was even considered illegal and was met with court cases and even death threats. The government refused them permission to play India in 1997 and ruled that women were forbidden from playing sports in public due to religious issues.\nHowever, the team did manage to overcome these objections and represented Pakistan in 1997, playing against New Zealand and Australia. They lost all three One Day International matches on that tour, but they were still invited to take part in the Women's Cricket World Cup later that year in India. They lost all five matches in the tournament and finished last, out of the eleven teams in the competition. The following year, Pakistan toured Sri Lanka and played three One Day International matches, losing all of their matches and played in their first Test match, which they also lost.\n2000s.\nIn 2000, Pakistan toured Ireland for a five match One Day International series against Ireland. They lost the Test match by an innings inside two days and the One Day International series 4–0, with one match interrupted by rain. Their first international win, in their 19th match, came against the Netherlands in a seven match One Day International series at their home ground in 2001, a series which they won 4–3. This form did not continue into their six One Day International tour of Sri Lanka in January 2002, though, and they again lost all six matches.\nIn 2003, Pakistan travelled to the Netherlands to take part in the 2003 IWCC Trophy, the inaugural edition of what is now called simply the World Cup Qualifier. They finished fourth in the tournament, winning against Japan and Scotland. However, they missed out on qualification for the 2005 Women's Cricket World Cup. The 2003 IWCC Trophy was marred by a schism between the Pakistan Women's Cricket Control Association and the Pakistan Cricket Board. The IWCC did not recognize the Pakistan Cricket Board as the governing body of women's cricket in Pakistan and court cases were brought in Pakistan. The Pakistan Cricket Board announced that they would not be sending a team to the tournament and that no other team should be allowed to represent the country in the competition. This problem was overcome with the International Cricket Council requirement that women's associations and men's associations be unified under one single governing body.\n2004 saw the West Indies tour Pakistan, playing seven One Day International matches and a Test match. The Test match was drawn and West Indies won the One Day International series 5–2, but those two victories for Pakistan were their first against a Test-playing nation.\nIn 2005, Pakistan Cricket Board established a women's wing to oversee all cricket affairs under the Pakistan Cricket Board's control and to unite all the conflicts between various associations. The first international event was when Indian under-21 team toured Pakistan, becoming the first Indian women's side to tour the country. This paved the way for Pakistan to host the second Women's Asia Cup in December 2005/January 2006. They lost all their games however, finishing last in the three-team tournament. The tournament featured the first match between the Indian and Pakistani women's cricket teams.\nEarly in 2007, the Pakistan squad toured South Africa and played in a five match, One Day International series. During that year, Pakistan was announced as the host for the Women's Cricket World Cup Qualifier in which eight teams were scheduled to participate. All of the arrangements were almost completed for the tournament to be held in November when, unfortunately, the event was postponed due to political instability and was moved to South Africa. Pakistan qualified for the 2009 Women's Cricket World Cup by defeating Ireland, Zimbabwe, Scotland and Netherlands. They qualified for this tournament after defeating Hong Kong in a three match series in Pakistan in September 2006.\nIn Pakistan, views towards women's cricket have softened considerably since its introduction. Cricket is currently seen as an improvement for women's rights.\nIn June 2019, the PCB reduced the number of contracted players from 17 to 10, but increased remuneration for the retained players.\nWorld Cup records.\nWomen's ODI World Cup.\nPakistan have participated in five editions of the Women's Cricket World Cup: in 1997, 2009, 2013, 2017, and 2022.

        "text": "Daniel Patrick Neil (born October 21, 1973) is a former American college and professional football guard in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons; and a politician. He played college football for the University of Texas, and earned All-American honors. He was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the third round of the 1997 NFL Draft, and played for the Broncos during his entire pro football career. Neil was a candidate for the Texas House of Representatives in the 2010 general election.\nEarly years.\nNeil was born in Houston, Texas. He attended Cypress Creek High School in suburban Houston, where he played high school football for the Cypress Creek Cougars.\nCollege career.\nHe accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Texas at Austin, and played for the Texas Longhorns football team from 1993 to 1996. He was a first team All-American in 1995 and a consensus first-team All-American in 1996. He helped Texas win the last Southwest Conference Championship in 1995 and the first Big 12 one in 1996. In his senior year he was team captain, MVP, a semifinalist for the Lombardi Award and a finalist for the Outland Trophy.\nProfessional career.\nThe Denver Broncos selected Neil in the third round (67th pick overall) of the 1997 NFL Draft. He played for the Broncos from to . After seeing limited playing time as a rookie in 1997, he became a reliable starter on the Broncos' offensive line, starting in 104 of 108 games over the next seven seasons. He was the starter for the Broncos' NFL championship team in Super Bowl XXXIII and was on the team when they won Super Bowl XXXII, though he was inactive throughout most of the season, including the playoffs. He was a free agent after the 2000 season, but was signed again by the Broncos to a multi-year deal.\nIn the 2001 season, he was fined $15,000 for an illegal block that broke the leg of New England's Bryan Cox. No penalty was called on the play, but NFL director of football operations Gene Washington said Neil clipped the New England linebacker \"from behind and below the knee.\" Cox vowed revenge for the hit, but did not follow through.\nNeil was rarely injured, but missed the last two 2003 regular season games with a thumb injury and the end of the 2004 season, including Denver's playoff game, with knee and stomach injuries. Following the 2004 season, Neil was released by the Broncos.\nLife after football.\nIn 2010, Neil was the Republican nominee for the 48th District of the Texas House of Representatives. His opponents were Democratic incumbent Donna Howard and Libertarian Ben Easton. The election returns showed Howard winning by 16 votes. Neil challenged the results in the Texas House. A select investigating committee found that although Howard had actually won by only four votes, Neil had not met the burden of proof required to overturn the election. Neil dropped the challenge on March 18, 2011, nearly halfway into the legislative session. Even with the 12 vote victory that the Secretary of State considers official, it is the closest Texas House raceon record.\nPrior to pursuing political aspirations, Neil co-hosted \"The Morning Rush\" with Erin Hogan on the Austin area ESPN Radio affiliate 104.9 The Horn.\nNeil's son David played varsity football at Westlake High School in West Lake Hills, Texas, from 2015 into the 2018–2019 season.\nNeil was inducted to the Texas Athletics Hall of Honor in 2008 and nominated to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2021, 2022 and 2023."

He finished third in the league in hits (155), batting average (.336), and on-base percentage (.362), and led the league in games played (111) and singles (126).\nMoore had a quick temper, and was blacklisted by multiple major and minor leagues during his career for unsportsmanlike conduct, including refusing to field balls hit to his position, and refusing to run the bases after hits."

Matches have been recorded between 1771 and 1848 and the team played in 15 first-class matches between 1826 and 1848.\nThe earliest reference to cricket in the county of Nottinghamshire is a match between Nottingham and Sheffield Cricket Club at the Forest Racecourse in Nottingham in August 1771. In many sources, the Nottingham team is called the \"Nottingham Old Club\" or as the \"town club\" to distinguish it from Nottinghamshire County Cricket Club, which began playing in the 1840s. Nottinghamshire as a county team played its first inter-county match versus Sussex at Brown's Ground in Brighton in August 1835, with early matches probably being organised by the town club.\nThere is still a Nottingham Cricket Club, known as Nottinghamians which is part of the rugby union club of that name.\nFirst-class matches played by Nottingham Cricket Club.\nNottingham played 15 first-class matches between July 1826 and August 1848. Their first first-class opponents were a Sheffield and Leicester side. Their opponents were most frequently Sheffield, with 12 of the 15 matches against this side. The team also played two matches against the Cambridge Town Club."

In that event, the then-defending series champions Fiji would have clinched the season crown by defeating Wales in the Cup quarterfinals. However, a Wales upset win opened the door for New Zealand to take the season crown by winning the Cup in Edinburgh, which they did.\nSevens is traditionally played in a two-day tournament format; however, the most famous event, the Hong Kong Sevens, is played over three days.\nCalendar.\nTournaments in Australia and Scotland were added for 2006-07. The Australian event returned after a three season hiatus to effectively replace Singapore. The Scotland event effectively replaced the Paris Sevens.\nThe season.\nIn a normal event, 16 teams are entered; in Hong Kong, 24 teams enter. In each tournament, the teams are divided into pools of four teams, who play a round-robin within the pool. Points are awarded in each pool on a different schedule from most rugby tournaments—3 for a win, 2 for a draw, 1 for a loss. The first tiebreaker is the head-to-head result between the tied teams, followed by difference in points scored during the tournament.\nFour trophies are awarded in each tournament, except for Hong Kong. In descending order of prestige, they are the Cup, whose winner is the overall tournament champion, Plate, Bowl and Shield. In Hong Kong, the Shield is not awarded. Each trophy is awarded at the end of a knockout tournament.\nIn a normal event, the top two teams in each pool advance to the Cup competition. The four quarterfinal losers drop into the bracket for the Plate. The Bowl is contested by the third-place finishers in each pool, while the Shield is contested by the last-place teams from each pool.\nIn Hong Kong, the six pool winners, plus the two highest-finishing second-place teams, advance to the Cup. The Plate participants are the eight highest-ranked teams remaining, while the lowest eight drop to the Bowl.\nPoints schedule.\nThe season championship was determined by the total points earned in all tournaments. The points schedules used for 2006–07 World Sevens Series were tweaked slightly from the previous season at the bottom end of each scale: \nFinal standings.\nThe points awarded to the teams at each event, as well as their overall series totals, are shown in the table below.

At the 2006 ICC Americas Championship, the team won the division three event, and was promoted to division two for the 2008 edition. Suriname also won that event, and were promoted to the 2008 Division One tournament in the United States, but were immediately relegated after going winless.

Suriname re-entered the WCL system at the 2015 Division Six event in England, and subsequently qualified for 2016 Division Five. However, they later withdrew from the Division Five tournament due to an ICC investigation about the eligibility of some of their players.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members.

This qualified them for the Division Two tournament played in Argentina late in 2006, when they came fourth out of five teams, which means that they will keep their Division Two place in 2008.\nSuriname placed fifth at the 2009 Global Division Seven tournament and was relegated to Division Eight, where it placed fifth to again be relegated.\nRecords.\nOne-day.\nBelow is a record of international matches played in the one-day format by Suriname between 2004 and 2015."

The team is organised by the Vanuatu Cricket Association, which became an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 1995 and an associate member in 2009. Vanuatu made its international debut at the 1979 Pacific Games, at which time the country was still known as the New Hebrides.

        "title": "Ice hockey in Calgary",
        "text": "The history of ice hockey in Calgary extends back well over a century to the first recorded ice hockey game in Alberta in 1893. Imported from eastern Canada, the game's popularity rapidly grew in the city, with teams at every level playing for and capturing Canada's national championships. Calgary is known today as one of Canada's best ice hockey cities with the Calgary Flames and Calgary Hitmen receiving immense support from the city. The Calgary Oval X-Treme is one of the most dominant women's ice hockey teams in the country, while Junior A ice hockey is also well supported with two teams in the city. Calgary is home to the Mac's AAA midget hockey tournament, one of the most prestigious midget hockey tournaments in the world which has seen dozens of future National Hockey League players play in this city before their professional careers began.\nHistory.\nEarly days.\nThe first recorded ice hockey game in Alberta took place in Calgary on January 4, 1893, between two city teams: the \"Town Boys\" and the \"Tailors\". The game was played with seven players aside and the Town Boys won 4-1. Shortly after, the Town Boys met a challenge from a team of North-West Mounted Police officers, losing 4-0 before avenging the defeat in a rematch.\nIn 1898, the first \"Battle of Alberta\" took place in Edmonton, as the Edmonton Thistles faced a team made up of members of the Calgary fire brigade. The match turned violent and a brawl saw Calgary's E.D. Marshall lose an eye in a stick swinging incident.\nCalgary Tigers.\nMajor professional ice hockey arrived in the prairies in 1921 with the formation of the Western Canada Hockey League. The Calgary Tigers brought five future Hockey Hall of Fame players to the city in Barney Stanley, Red Dutton, Rusty Crawford, Herb Gardiner and Harry Oliver. During the Tigers' six-year run, they captured three regular season titles and two playoff championships. In 1924, the Tigers challenged the National Hockey League's Montreal Canadiens for the Stanley Cup. The Tigers lost, however, in two straight games with scores of 6-1 and 3-0, Howie Morenz scoring a hat-trick in the first game and another goal in the second for the Canadiens. It was nearly 60 years before Calgary again challenged for ice hockey's holy grail. The Tigers ceased operations in 1927, succumbing to the costs of maintaining an all-star lineup. Following the demise of the Tigers, no major professional club would emerge in Calgary until the 1975 arrival of the World Hockey Association.\nCalgary Stampeders.\nIn the year following World War II, the Calgary Stampeders brought home Calgary's first, and only, Allan Cup national senior championship with a four games to one series victory over the Hamilton Tigers. The 1945–46 Stampeders were a powerhouse club, compiling a record of 42-9-5, culminating in a 1-0 victory in the fifth and deciding game against Hamilton, played before a sold-out crowd of over 6,000 at the Edmonton Gardens in Edmonton. The Stampeders won three Western Canada Senior Hockey League titles in the league's six-year run.\nAfter having a new arena built in 1950, the Stampeders turned professional in 1951, spending the next twelve years in the Western Hockey League, which was at the time the top professional circuit in the west. The Stampeders won the 1954 WHL championship in Calgary. The team folded in 1963 after succumbing to the financial pressures of operating in such a widespread league.\nJunior ice hockey.\nAlberta Junior Hockey League.\nJunior ice hockey in Alberta began to take shape in 1963 when the Alberta Junior Hockey League was formed, partially to check the dominance of the Edmonton Oil Kings at the time. The five team loop featured two teams from Calgary - the Calgary Cowboys and Calgary Buffaloes. The Buffaloes were the early powerhouse of the league, winning the AJHL's first two championships in 1964 and 1965. The two teams struggled against the Western Canada Hockey League, however, and in 1965, the Cowboys merged with the Buffaloes before folding altogether in 1969.\nThe AJHL returned to Calgary in 1971 when the Calgary Canucks was formed. The Canucks was the brainchild of Doug Eastcott, and was created as an outlet to give Calgary area youngsters a place to play without sacrificing their education. Acting as an extension of the Calgary minor hockey association, the Canucks restricted themselves to only three out-of-town players for many years. The Canucks have become one of the most dominant clubs in the AJHL, having won nine AJHL championships, two Doyle Cups and the Centennial Cup in 1995 as Canadian Tier II national champions. Nearly 50 former Canucks have gone on to play in the NHL, including Heatley, Mike Vernon, Jason Smith, Doug Houda and Craig Adams.\nIn 1978, a second team in Calgary was added as the Calgary Chinooks relocated from Pincher Creek. The team became the Spurs two years later, but never found the same success as the Canucks. In 1990, the Spurs ceased operations; however their assets were purchased by a new ownership group that rebranded the club the Calgary Royals. The Royals captured their single AJHL title in their inaugural season, but have failed to repeat that success.\nWestern Hockey League.\nThree years after the arrival of the AJHL, another league, the Western Canada Junior Hockey League was formed. It was considered a \"rebel league\" by the Canadian Hockey Association, and thus not permitted to play for the Memorial Cup. The seven team loop featured five teams that defected from the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League along with the Edmonton Oil Kings, and an expansion team for Calgary, the Calgary Buffaloes. The Buffaloes were dismal in the league's inaugural season in 1966–67 season, finishing just 4-47-5. The franchise renamed itself the Calgary Centennials the following year, and had moderate success in the mid-1970s, winning three division titles and reaching the league finals once. It relocated to Billings, Montana in 1977 to become the Billings Bighorns. That franchise continues today as the Tri-City Americans. Future NHLers John Davidson, Bob Nystrom and Mike Rogers played for the Centennials.\nThe Centennials were immediately replaced by the Calgary Wranglers, who relocated from Winnipeg, Manitoba. Like the Centennials, the Wranglers never became a top team in the league, though they did reach the finals in 1980–81. Declining interest in the team because of the popularity of the Calgary Flames led to the Wranglers moving south to Lethbridge, Alberta in 1987 to become the Lethbridge Hurricanes. Doug Houda, Kelly Kisio, Dana Murzyn and former Flames head coach Jim Playfair are among the former Wranglers who made the NHL.\nDespite a long-standing belief that major-junior ice hockey could not compete with the professionals, the WHL again placed a team in Calgary in 1995. The Calgary Hitmen were owned by, among others, Theoren Fleury, Joe Sakic and Bret Hart, after whom the team was named. The Hitmen created an immediate controversy with their logo, featuring a stylized \"Jason Voorhees\" type mask and distinctive pink and grey jersey colours. Despite its immense popularity, the WHL initially forbade the Hitmen from using the logo, deeming the look too violent, but relented a year later. The Hitmen currently use an updated version of the original logo.\nThe Hitmen were abysmal in their first two seasons, winning just 33 games combined. The team also faced further controversy when head coach Graham James resigned after being charged with, and later convicted of, sexually abusing two of his players when he was with the Swift Current Broncos. In 1997, the Hitmen were purchased by the Calgary Flames. The team's fortunes improved immediately, as the Hitmen won their division in 1997–98, and the following season, the Hitmen captured the league championship in just their fourth season. The Hitmen advanced all the way to the 1999 Memorial Cup title game before losing in overtime to the host Ottawa 67's 7-6 in a thrilling final.\nThe Hitmen have not managed to duplicate that success, but in recent years have showcased many good, young players who have helped Canada dominate the World Junior Hockey Championship. Andrew Ladd and Ryan Getzlaf were members of the dominating club that won gold in the 2005 tournament in Grand Forks, North Dakota, while goaltender Justin Pogge led Canada to a surprise defense of their championship in the 2006 tournament in Vancouver. Ladd also became the first Hitmen graduate to win the Stanley Cup, which he did with the Carolina Hurricanes in 2006.\nThe Hitmen have also become one of the most popular junior teams in Canada, leading the WHL in attendance four consecutive years, including a Canadian Hockey League then-record average of 10,062 in 2004–05, the first junior team to ever average over 10,000 fans per game.\nWorld Hockey Association.\nIn 1971, a fledgling operation known as the World Hockey Association announced its intention to compete against the NHL as North America's second major league. Among the original franchises announced for the league was the Calgary Broncos, who were to play out of the Stampede Corral and were expected to form a strong rivalry with the Edmonton Oilers. Although the Broncos participated in the first WHA draft, the franchise never played, folding prior to the WHA's inaugural season. Following the demise of the Broncos, the Oilers were renamed the Alberta Oilers, with the intention of splitting their home games between Calgary and Edmonton. Likewise, this plan failed to materialize and 'Alberta' was quickly dropped from the Oilers' name.\nIn 1975, the WHA finally did arrive in Calgary, as the Vancouver Blazers relocated to the Stampede City to become the Calgary Cowboys. The Cowboys finished the 1975–76 season with a respectable 41-35-4 record, upsetting the Quebec Nordiques in the playoffs before losing to the eventual Avco Cup champion Winnipeg Jets.\nThe Cowboys second season was the franchise's last, as dismal attendance and a team that missed the playoffs led to the franchise folding following the season. The entire league itself would follow two years later, with four teams merging into the NHL.\nCalgary Flames.\nIn 1980, the National Hockey League finally arrived in Calgary when Nelson Skalbania, a Vancouver-based businessman, got wind of the pending sale of the Atlanta Flames to a group of Calgary-area businessmen. Skalbania intercepted the sale by offering team owner Tom Cousins a 25% increase over his previous asking price of US$12 million and providing an immediate $1 million down payment for the team. The purchase price of US$16 million was the highest ever paid for an NHL team at the time. Relocating the team to Calgary, Skalbania's interest was soon bought out by the \"original six\" Calgary businessmen (Ralph T. Scurfield, Daryl Seaman, Byron Seaman, Harley Hotchkiss, Norman Green, and Norman Kwong) thus ensuring the future stability of the franchise in Calgary.\nThe Flames first season in the raucous Stampede Corral was a major success, as the team defeated both the Chicago Black Hawks and Philadelphia Flyers in the playoffs before being defeated themselves by the Minnesota North Stars in the league semi-finals.\nIn 1981, the Flames traded for Lanny McDonald, then of the Colorado Rockies. McDonald's trademark moustache and his enthusiasm for the game defined the Flames throughout the 1980s. In 1982–83, McDonald battled young superstar Wayne Gretzky for the league goal scoring title for the entire season. McDonald's tally of 66 goals - still a franchise record - fell just five markers short of Gretzky's total of 71.\nGlory years.\n1986 saw the Flames run to the Stanley Cup finals, capturing the organization's first Campbell Bowl before bowing out to the Montreal Canadiens in five games in the finals. The 1985–86 season is best known for the Flames shocking seven game upset of the powerhouse Oilers in the Smythe Division finals. The series winning goal was scored by Oilers' rookie defenseman Steve Smith - on his birthday - after he banked the puck into his own net off the skate of goaltender Grant Fuhr. The upset ended the Oilers' hopes of winning a third consecutive Stanley Cup. A decade later, Smith came to play for the Flames, eventually becoming team captain.\nIn 1989, the Flames captured their first, and only, Stanley Cup, avenging their loss in 1986 by defeating the Canadiens in six games. Despite dominating the league in 1988–89, winning the Presidents' Trophy as regular season champions, Calgary had to survive a major scare at the hands of the Vancouver Canucks, who despite finishing 43 points behind the Flames, took Calgary to overtime in the seventh game in the Smythe Division semifinals. Calgary then went on to defeat the Kings, Blackhawks and the aforementioned Canadiens to capture Lord Stanley's Mug. McDonald, who scored his 500th goal and 1000th point during the season, retired following the season.\n\"Decline\".\nAfter winning the Cup, the Flames faced a long decline through the 1990s and into the 21st century. Declining fortunes on the ice, escalating salaries, a low Canadian Dollar and management blunders saw the Flames fail to win a single playoff series following their Cup win until 2004, while the team missed the playoffs seven straight years between 1997 and 2003. On January 2, 1992, GM Doug Risebrough completed what is often regarded as one of the most lopsided trades in NHL history. Embroiled in a contract dispute with Doug Gilmour, Risebrough traded the disgruntled star to the Toronto Maple Leafs along with Rick Wamsley, Ric Nattress, Jamie Macoun and Kent Manderville for Gary Leeman, Michel Petit, Jeff Reese, Craig Berube and Alexander Godynyuk. The deal - one of the largest in NHL history - catapulted the formerly inept Maple Leafs into years of being a contender, while hastening the decline of the Flames. Not a single player acquired by the Flames was still with the organization two years later.\nResurgence.\nThe Flames finally emerged from their post-season drought in 2003–04. Led by coach/GM Darryl Sutter, superstar forward Jarome Iginla and the emerging goaltending star Miikka Kiprusoff, the Flames shocked the ice hockey world by becoming the first team to defeat three division winners \"en route\" to the Stanley Cup Finals. The defeats of the Vancouver Canucks, Detroit Red Wings and San Jose Sharks turned the Cinderella Flames into national heroes, while the parties on the Red Mile became international news. The Flames fell in the finals to the Tampa Bay Lightning in a hard-fought seven game series; however, the result was not without controversy due to a Martin Gelinas goal late in the third period of game 6. The puck was seen in replay to cross the goal line before being kicked back out by Lightning goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin. The play, which if reviewed may have broken the tie in Calgary's favour, in a game Tampa would later win in overtime to fend off elimination, was not immediately reviewed.\nThe Flames followed up that season by winning their sixth division championship in 2005–06, but were beaten in the first round of the playoffs by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim."

        "title": "Equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain",
        "text": "The equestrian statue of Charles IV of Spain (also known as \"El Caballito\") is a bronze sculpture cast by Manuel Tolsá built between 1796 and 1803 in Mexico City, Mexico in honour of King Charles IV of Spain, then the last ruler of the New Spain (later Mexico). This statue has been displayed in different points of the city and is considered one of the finest achievements of Mr. Tolsá. It now resides in Plaza Manuel Tolsá.\nHistory.\nThe project was initiated by Miguel de la Grúa Talamanca, Marquis of Branciforte, who was Viceroy of the New Spain. Once he obtained permission for the monument, he appointed people to perform the work and construction began. To that end, he emptied the main plaza (the Plaza de la Constitución, or “Zocalo”) and erected an elliptical railing with four access gates.\nThe pedestal for the statue was inaugurated with large and well-attended parties and bullfights on 8 December 1796. A temporary statue, constructed out of wood and gilded stucco, was placed on top of the pedestal; it also represented the Spanish monarch.\nThe Equestrian Statue of Charles IV was melted and cast in one operation under the supervision of Tolsá, who was director of the Academy of San Carlos. The statue required between 450 and 600 quintales of bronze (one quintal being equivalent to 46 kg), and was cast in the area near the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul. The sculptor modeled the frame after a horse owned by the Marquis of Jaral of Berrio named \"Tambor\" (or \"drum\"). After being polished and engraved, the statue was taken to its pedestal and inaugurated on 9 December 1803. The celebrations and bullfights were repeated, with great jubilation. The Baron Alexander von Humboldt was present at the unveiling. In his opinion, and for this genre, the statue produced by Tolsá is second only to the equestrian statue of Marcus Aurelius, in Rome.\nIn 1821, due to anti-Hispanic sentiment manifesting during the Mexican independence, and due to a desire to replace the monument, the statue was covered in a blue tent. It was not long before people considered destroying the monument, to melt it down to reuse the bronze for guns or coins. Aggravating matters, underneath one of the hooves of the statue one will find the mark of an Aztec quiver, perhaps a sign of allegiance to Spain.\nThe statue was saved by Lucas Alamán, who convinced Guadalupe Victoria to retain the statue on the merit of its aesthetic qualities. This resulted in the statue being relocated in 1822 to the courtyard of the ancient university, to prevent people from destroying it. It wasn't until 1824 that the public was permitted to access the statue, but the statue was much safer in this location. In 1852, after years had passed and tempers had calmed, the statue was moved to the intersection Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida Bucareli, although this time it was protected from potential damage by a grille. In 1979 it was relocated to its current location, Plaza Manuel Tolsá, overlooking the Palacio de Minería. Currently, in response to the earlier controversy surrounding the statue, the plaque on the pedestal indicates that Mexico conserved the statue as a monument to art, and not as a sign of praise to a Spanish king. A smaller, slightly different version of the sculpture can be seen in the Tolsá museum opposite the statue.\nThe statue weighs 26 tonnes and is the second largest cast bronze statue in the world.\nThe place the statue occupied between 1852 and 1979, the corner of Paseo de la Reforma and Bucareli is now occupied by a statue called \"El caballito\" (\"The Horse\"), by sculptor Sebastián, erected in honour of the old monument."

        "title": "Coach (basketball)",
        "text": "Basketball coaching is the act of directing and strategizing the behavior of a basketball team or individual basketball player. Basketball coaching typically encompasses the improvement of individual and team offensive and defensive skills, as well as overall physical conditioning. Coaches also have the responsibility to improve their team by player development, strategy, and in-game management. Coaches also teach and inspire their team to be their best.\nCoaching is usually performed by a single person, often with the help of one or more assistants.\nCoaching tools.\nA dry erase clipboard or tablet computer with a basketball court outline is often used mid-game to describe plays and provide an overview of the strategy of the opposing team. Coaches strategize and scout opposing teams and find ways to defeat them as easily as possible. At the same time, they overlook their own personal team to start the best five players (only five players can be on floor at one time). Coaches, also, have to be aware of substitutes to put in throughout the game so they can be fresh.\nA drill designer is used to sketch drills, plays and information. Coaches also utilise file managers to store all coaching materials in one place and access from anywhere. Planners are also used to blueprint strategies and game plans.\nCollege basketball coach John Wooden would spend two hours each morning with assistants planning out a day's practice minute-by-minute on three-by-five cards. He kept each card year over year to adjust and improve. He would train his players with \"mental and emotional\" conditioning by always making practice more intense than the game. Players would run faster than what a game would require so that they could be prepared to dominate in the game.\nCoaching Strategy.\nA coach's job is to draw up plays and implement systems for the offense and defense. These strategies can mean the difference between winning and losing a game. An offensive coach that is playing against a zone defense needs to create a play for his team to score. Kimble explains that a coach must have a fundamental set that is the base for every play against a zone, because each zone defense is so different (Kimble, 30).\nOffensive Strategy.\nAgainst a Man to Man Defense.\nA coach needs to have a basic play to call against a zone defense and a man to man defense. With a man defense, a coach has an offense that is continuous. A popular offensive schematic is called the flex offense. In the flex offense, we have two guards on the wings, two post on the blocks, and a shooting guard in the corner. The point guard drives the ball to the wing on the side that has the shooting guard. He then swings the ball to the guard on the offside wing and the shooting guard runs his flex cut, past the screen given by the post on the block. The other post pops out to the corner and, ideally, the shooting guard is open in the key and gets an easy layup. If not, the point guard screens down to the post, the post pops up and gets the pass and we are now in position for the other corner to flex cut again. This offense can run continuously until there is a score or a turnover. This offense only works if the coach can teach his players how to cut and screen effectively. 4\nAgainst a Zone Defense.\nWhen playing against a zone, the idea is to spread the defense thin and then exploit the soft spots in the middle of the zone and when it shifts, use the shooters on the outside. The general layout for any zone offense is a point guard at the top, two shooting guards on the wings, and two posts down low. When the point guard passes to the left, the left post drops to the short corner between the block and the baseline in that soft spot. The other post comes up to the freethrow line extended and makes himself big at the high post. Coaches teach a tactic called inside out. This means that the goal is to feed the ball from the wing into one of the posts. If the high post gets the ball, he faces the basket and has a ton of options. He can drive and score, shoot the ball, feed the low post that cuts to the basket, feed the offside shooting guard that cuts backdoor, or kick it back out to the guard that gave him the ball so he can shoot or drive. The goal is to find the open man, because each time a pass is made, the defense has to shift. The coach must teach the players to look up, run the play, and find the soft spots in the zone with and without the ball. This play base only works if players find open lanes and the players with the ball find the open man. Quick passes cause more shift in the defense.\nDefensive Strategy.\nNo matter what type of defense that is drawn up by a coach, the players must be taught some basic fundamentals. Some important ones are how to get over a screen, how to box out and rebound, and how to close out a shooter. To do this, a coach must teach positioning over all else so that the rest of these skills come easier. Players need to be aggressive. This throws off the offense so they don't pass as well, they rush shots, and forget their fundamentals. A coach needs to teach two things to all his players so they can be confident in taking risks and playing this aggressive style.\nEspecially guards need to be taught to overplay the passing lanes. This means that they anticipate the pass and jump into the lane when the ball is thrown. This gets steals and scares the offensive guards. The problem is that if your defense does this too often, it leaves the rest of your players vulnerable to an attack when a pass is faked, and the offensive guard cuts back door. This leaves your guard out of position, however, this doesn't have to be a bad thing if you teach your players the second fundamental.\nPlayers must be taught helpside defense. This is a system that must be used no matter what defense you run as a coach. The premise is that the player guarding the ball is right on him, the players guarding someone that is one pass away from the ball, need to play close to them or denying a pass. The other players that are guarding guys that are further from the ball need to sag into the middle to help their teammates. If a defensive player jumps a passing lane, or someone gets beat off the dribble, there must be players that sag off their man to help stop the ball. Once this happens, the defensive player that got beat is responsible to recover and get down to switch with their helpside player. Teaching helpside defense gives a coach's defensive players the confidence to play aggressive defense because they know there is help behind them if they need it."

Wests also draw from Ipswich and Springfield.\nWests is one of the smaller Premier Rugby clubs in terms of player numbers, but it has achieved a share of success in the competition, winning premierships in 1977, 1985, 2006, and 2022.\nTheir theme song is based on \"Take Me Home, Country Roads\".\nHistory.\nWests Rugby Union Club was founded in 1951 and only fielded one team, but went on to win the reserve grade competition in that first season. Player numbers increased in following years and the club was promoted to the first grade competition in 1955.\nThe Bulldog mascot was adopted in 1956. The club's blue and white jerseys were changed to red, white and blue in 1959 to be more distinguishable from the Brothers' colours, but were finally changed to green and gold in 1961 when Wests amalgamated with the Toowong Rugby Club. The merger prompted a shift of home ground from Normanby in Spring Hill to Memorial Park at Sylvan Road in Toowong.\nWests won the first grade Premiership in 1977, the club's 23rd season in the competition. Stan Pileki and Trevor Davies were the props in the team that was captained by Geoff Wessling.\nIn 1985, Wests won its second Premiership, and went on to become Australian Club champions in 1986 by defeating Parramatta. Later that year, Wests played Toulouse in the final of the Toulouse Masters, losing 11–6.\nWests had four players selected for Australia at the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup; Roger Gould, Troy Coker, Bill Campbell and Brian Smith. The depth of future talent at the club in 1987 was illustrated when Wests won all three Colts grade (under 19) premierships on the same day. Thirteen players from the Colts I team went on to representative honours; most notably Phil de Glanville, the future England Captain, who played at centre.\nIn 1991, Wests won the Minor Premiership but lost the Grand Final to Souths, and a period of rebuilding on and off the field followed. Clubhouse facilities were extended in 1992–93, and the first Women's team was formed in 1994. Wests began another resurgence in the late 1990s. The club made the Grand Final three years in a row from 1998 to 2000 but fell agonisingly short each time.\nThey finally broke through to win the Premiership again for the first time in 21 years, by beating rugby stronghold Brothers by one point in 2006. The 2020s Wests crop have included Connor Anderson, Lopeti Faifua, Filipo Daugunu, Hunter Paisami, Ilaisa Droasese, Carter Gordon, Mason Gordon (rugby union), Isaac Henry (rugby union), Angelo Smith, and Glen Vaihu. \nWests became the Minor Premiers in 2022 and went on to defeat the University of Queensland 44–27 to win the Grand Final.

        "text": "GPS Rugby Club, colloquially known as Jeeps, is an Australian rugby union club based at Ashgrove in Brisbane that plays in the Queensland Premier Rugby competition.\nGPS also participates in the Brisbane Grades and Colts competitions, and in the \"Golden Oldies\" competition for the over 35's.\nThe club has produced more than fifty Wallabies, including Ben Tune, Daniel Herbert, and Matt Cockbain, and many other representative and professional players.\nClub names.\n\"Jeeps\" is derived from \"GPS Old Boys\", which was adopted as the name of the club in the 1930s. The club traces its origins back to 1887, when the \"Past &amp; Present Grammar Club\" was formed from teachers, students, and past students of the Brisbane Grammar School (BGS).\n\"Past &amp; Present Grammar\" evolved into \"Past Grammar\", and eventually \"BGS Old Boys\". The \"BGS Old Boys\" became \"GPS Old Boys\" when broadening the membership base in 1931, as players were sought from other Great Public Schools (GPS).\nJeeps has no formal link with the GPS Association, apart from the name, and the club is open to senior and junior players from all schools and backgrounds.\nHistory.\nGPS Old Boys claims to be one of the oldest rugby clubs in Australia, and traces its heritage back to a Past &amp; Present Grammar club formed in 1887. The Past &amp; Present Grammar Club fielded teams made up of teachers, students, and some past students of the Brisbane Grammar School through to 1890.\nAt a meeting of the Old Boys on Thursday 5 March 1891, it was decided to form a Club composed of past members of the Brisbane Grammar School. \"(ref: Brisbane Courier Saturday 7 March 1891)\". This Past Grammar Club was a separate entity from the Past &amp; Present Grammar Club.\nThe Past Grammar Club played in the Senior Grade competition in Brisbane from 1891 through to 1900, until the introduction of the Electorate Football System in 1901. The club returned with the reintroduction of the Club Football System in 1905, and played through to 1914.\nAfter WWI, Past Grammar rejoined Brothers, Valleys &amp; University and played in the 1919 QRU competition, but moved over to Rugby League in 1920 when the Rugby Union was disbanded in the 1920s. The Past Grammar Club that moved to Rugby League would later become Northern Suburbs Districts and finally Norths Devils in the Brisbane Rugby League.\nA new incarnation called BGS Old Boys Football Club was formed in 1928, when a small faction of members from the original Past Grammar left the club to play in the reinstated rugby union competition. \"(Ref: Norths Devils website)\"\nBGS Old Boys played a number of exhibition games against the newly formed YMCA Club. However this new Club was quite separate to the original Past Grammar Club which was still playing in the Brisbane Rugby League Competition. These 2 Clubs would form the heart of the 5 Club 1929 QRU Senior Rugby Competition which also included Valleys, Wynnum District and Past Commercials.\nAccording to noted rugby historian Ian Diehm in his book Red! Red! Red!, Past Grammar reformed along with other clubs after the devastation of the first world war, and eventually became GPS Old Boys in 1931 after a change of constitution, which broadened its membership beyond old boys of Brisbane Grammar. The first president of GPS Old Boys was Dr Kenneth Fraser and its first coach Dr \"Jacky\" Beath, the former Wallaby and Australian Infantry Forces fullback.\nFour members of the club - \"Blow\" Ide, Bill McLean, Boyd Oxlade and Llewellyn \"Welly\" Lewis went to England with the 1939 Wallabies, but only McLean continued after World War II. McLean was the first of GPS's two Australian captains, Arch Winning being the second.\nThe club has had many homes: New Farm Park, Finsbury Park and, since 1977, Ashgrove Sports Ground.\nPast Grammar had won premierships in 1892, 1898, 1899 and 1914. GPS won the 1942 and 1943 \"A\" Grade Premierships (Keith Horsley Memorial Trophy) against Eagle Junction and University respectively, but had to wait until 1961 to win the Hospital Challenge Cup, coached by the former GPS player and later Queensland and Australian coach, the late Bob Templeton.\nThe club won the premiership again in 1972 and for a fifth time in 1996, when the A Grade team upset Souths 12-6. After a 22-year drought, GPS won the premiership for a sixth time in 2018.\nHISTORICAL CHRONOLOGY \n\"School Team (BRISBANE GRAMMAR SCHOOL)\"\n\"Old Boys Team (PAST GRAMMAR)\"\n\"Old Boys Team (GPS OLD BOYS)\"\nPremiership finals results.\nPast Grammar.\n\"Premiers (5)\"\n\"Runners-Up (9)\"\nGPS Old Boys.\n\"Premiers (6)\"\n\"Runners-Up (19)\"\nNotes&lt;br&gt;\nNational Club Champions.\nThe Australian Club Championship is a challenge match between the Brisbane and Sydney club premiers.

        "text": "The University of Queensland Rugby Club is an Australian rugby club, based at the University of Queensland in Brisbane, Queensland. They currently compete in the Queensland Premier Rugby competition. They were formed in 1911, as rugby was adopted by the Sports Association at the University of Queensland as a major sport.\nThe University of Queensland Rugby Football Club, although recently incorporated, was founded in 1911. Since then the club has seen several thousands of young men and women enjoy the game of Rugby and develop many friendships.\nThe club is affiliated with the Queensland Rugby Union (QRU) which is one of the member unions of the Australian Rugby Union (ARU). The club is also affiliated with The University of Queensland and has a relationship with local junior club, the Kenmore Bears.\nThe University of Queensland Rugby Club provides an environment where excellence and academic achievements are encouraged and extolled. Throughout the years, the club has established a proud Rugby tradition of great camaraderie, mateship and enjoyment which has significantly contributed to its ongoing success both on and off the field.\nMany of the club's players have been rewarded with representative honours whilst others have further contributed to the game as coaches, managers or administrators. 215 University players have represented Queensland with 66 having been selected for Australia (7 as captain).\nIn terms of elite coaches, the following have represented the Club at the highest level:\nPast players including Norbert Byrne, David Crombie, Dick Marks, Leo Williams (rugby union) and David Usasz have also made a mark on the game with their time served on the Boards of the Queensland Rugby Union and/or the Australian Rugby Union whilst Steve Wilson is a current member of the QRU Board having joined in March 2006.\nThe club is located on The University of Queensland St Lucia campus where it has its own Clubhouse and the use of three illuminated fields. The club is administered by a committee of honorary members who are assisted by full-time staff and coaches.\nThe club's players were available for selection to the now defunct Australian Rugby Championship franchise Ballymore Tornadoes.\nPremiership Finals results.\nNotes\n * University played in the Brisbane Rugby League premiership when the rugby union competition was disbanded from 1920 to 1927, and played both codes from 1928 to 1935.\n† Challenge Final - Some competitions in the early 1900s included the right to challenge the winner of the Premiership Final if a club won the Minor premiership and did not win the Premiership Final. The resultant match was called the Challenge Final and was later called the Grand Final. \n‡ The 1979 Grand Final was replayed after a 24–24 draw.\nNational Club Champions.\nUniversity have been the Australian club champions on two occasions (1990 and 2011).\nRivalry with Brothers Rugby Club.\nThe long tradition of clashes with Brothers first began in senior competition on 8 June 1912, with Brothers running out victors 24 - 0. The tradition of hard, close fought games between these two clubs remains a feature of the Brisbane club scene and there have been many memorable tussles over the years, particularly in grand finals. The most famous being the 24-all draw in 1979 that resulted in a rematch where University won 16–13 in a tight match. The latest bragging rights are with University after a 31–26 win in the 2019 final, the last time the teams have met in a grand final.\nU19 Colts.\nAfter great success in the early 2000s university colts dropped off the radar in 03 and 04 until 2005 when under the guidance of Andrew Tucker (Premier Director of Rugby) and the new appointments of Paul \"Taffy Longman\" (Head Colts Coach 05-06)and Rob Murdoch (Colts Assistant Coach 05-06) the club was able to recruit a forward pack with many state and national representatives. The club signed 6 starting QLD/ACT Representatives that played in front of a small but skilled back line. The 2005 premiership came after a landmark game against GPS in the semi-final, and a crushing win over brothers in the final.\nIn 2006 the club was pro-active in recruiting a number of Australian representatives and a high-profile New Zealand u19 representative. Indifferent form and injuries in the early part of the season had many critics claiming the uni boys could not retain their title, pressure to perform was high however the Uni Colts showed all the critics what sort of squad they were by taking the field for their remaining 8 fixtures and securing victories for all 8 in a row, successfully defending their 2005 title to be crowned 2006 premiers.\nBack to back premierships in the U19's was a fantastic result and one that uni had not seen for some time."

        "text": "The 2006 FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup was the second edition of the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup, governed by FIFA. Overall, this was the 12th edition of a world cup in beach soccer since the establishment of the \"Beach Soccer World Championships\" which ran from 1995–2004 but was not governed by FIFA. It took place in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, from 2–12 November 2006.\nThe winners of the tournament were hosts Brazil, who won their first FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup title and their tenth world title overall.\nMajor changes to format.\nAfter the 2005 World Cup, beach soccer continued to grow and spread worldwide at a fast rate. Therefore, FIFA established the \"FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup qualifiers\", to try to allow more nations to play in the World Cup, as well as getting more national teams involved in the sport. FIFA also increased the number of participating teams in the World Cup from 12 to a record-high 16 teams. This also meant that nations would no longer be invited to play in the World Cup but would have to qualify.\nWith the establishment of the qualifying rounds, FIFA decided to standardise each World Cup, meaning that from this World Cup onwards, each confederation would have the same number of teams participating in each World Cup and that the 16 teams would be split up into four groups of four teams, with the top two teams moving on to the quarter-finals.\nQualifying rounds.\nAfrican zone.\nAfrican nations were allocated 2 berths at the World Cup. The championship took place between September 28 and September 30, 2006. Cameroon and Nigeria were the two finalists, meaning they both qualified for the World Cup. Cameroon defeated Nigeria in the final to win the title.\nAsian zone.\nAsian nations were allocated 3 berths at the World Cup. The championship took place between May 22 and May 26, 2006. Bahrain and Japan were the two finalists, meaning they both qualified for the World Cup. Bahrain defeated Japan in the final to win the title. Iran and China were knocked out in the semi-finals and played each other in the third place play off. Iran beat China to claim the third berth at the World Cup.\nEuropean zone.\nEuropean nations were allocated 5 berths at the World Cup. Instead of having a specific tournament for World Cup qualification, qualification was achieved through the \"2006 Euro Beach Soccer League\" which took place earlier in the year. The nations who made it to the second stage of the Superfinal qualified to the World Cup being Spain, Portugal, Poland and Italy. To decide who would claim the fifth berth, the defeated nations in the competition came back to play in a straight knockout tournament, with the winner progressing to the World Cup. The nation which won the tournament was France who beat Switzerland in the final.\nNorth, Central American and Caribbean zone.\nNorth, Central American and Caribbean nations were allocated 2 berths at the World Cup. The championship took place between September 13 and September 17, 2006. The United States and Canada were the two finalists, meaning they both qualified for the World Cup. The United States defeated Canada in the final to win the title.\nOceanian zone.\nOceanian nations were allocated 1 berth at the World Cup. The championship took place between August 31 and September 3, 2006. The Solomon Islands and Vanuatu were the two finalists. The Solomon Islands defeated Vanuatu in the final to win the title and qualify for the World Cup.\nSouth American zone.\nSouth American nations were allocated 3 berths at the World Cup. The championship took place between March 5 and March 12, 2006. Brazil and Uruguay were the two finalists, meaning they both qualified for the World Cup. Brazil defeated Uruguay in the final to win the title. Argentina and Venezuela were knocked out in the semi-finals and played each other in the third place play off. Argentina beat Venezuela to claim the third berth at the World Cup.\nTeams.\nThese are the teams that qualified for the World Cup:\nAsian zone:\nAfrican zone:\nEuropean zone:\nNorth, Central American and Caribbean zone:\nOceanian zone:\nSouth American zone:\nVenue.\nAs with the previous FIFA editions of the World Cup held in Rio, the tournament once again took place at the Copacabana Beach Soccer Arena.\nGroup stage.\nThe 16 teams present at the finals in Brazil were split into 4 groups of 4 teams. Each team played the other 3 teams in its group in a round-robin format, with the top two teams advancing to the quarter finals. The quarter finals, semi finals and the final itself was played in the form of a knockout tournament.\nAll matches are listed as local time in Rio de Janeiro, (UTC-3)"

Internationally, Benfica won the EHF European League in 2021–22, becoming the first Portuguese club to win the competition.\nIn addition to the club's men's reserve team, Benfica B, playing in the second division, Benfica also has a women's team, who are the current Portuguese champions, having won 9 League titles, 8 Cups, and 4 Super Cups.\nHistory.\nBeginning.\nFounded on 8 May 1932, Benfica's handball section endured a troubled start shortly after being founded. It was inactive from 1939 to 1942–43 because of a conflict between Benfica and the Portuguese Handball Federation. Until the 1960s, handball was played by eleven players, and after 1962–63, in another dispute with the federation, Benfica closed the eleven players team and opted for the current team handball.\nThe handball section did not achieve success until 1961–62, being overshadowed by the football, cycling, basketball and roller hockey sections of the club during that time.\nGolden years.\nAfter a period of dominance by crosstown rivals Sporting CP, Benfica experienced great success in the 1980s and early 1990s, when was led by coach Eugene Troffin, and later by Ângelo Pintado, along with players such as Paulo Bunze, Swedish international Fredrik Appelgren, Dogărescu, Covaciu and Drăgăniță, goalkeeper João Santa Bárbara, wingman Mário Gentil, Vasco Vasconcelos, Luís Lopes and Rui Ferreira; Benfica won four national championships, three Portuguese Cup and two Portuguese Super Cup.\nDecay.\nIn the 1997–98 season, club president João Vale e Azevedo decided to shut down the section. It was restarted in the next season, but from the Regional Championship, four divisions away from the top flight.\nRebuilding years.\nIn 2005, after years in anonymity, Benfica hired former ABC Braga coach Aleksander Donner on a three-year deal.\nBecause of a dispute between Liga and the Handball Federation, which managed the Divisão de Elite, there were two simultaneous championships. In the 2005–06 season, Benfica played in the Divisão de Elite. In 2006–07, Benfica joined the Liga Portuguesa de Andebol along with Sporting CP. During that season, Benfica won their first title since 1994, the League Cup. In the following season, Benfica finally achieved their first league title since 1990. Despite the success, Aleksander Donner did not renew his contract at the end of the season.\nRecent years.\nTo replace Donner, Benfica hired José António Silva, who won three titles in three years: the 2008–09 League Cup, 2010–11 Portuguese Cup and 2010 Super Cup. In the 2010–11 season, Benfica reached the final of the EHF Challenge Cup, but lost to Slovene side RK Cimos Koper. In 2011–12, José António Silva was replaced by another former ABC Braga coach, Jorge Rito. With him, Benfica finished fourth in league for the first time. On 2 September 2012, Jorge Rito won Benfica's fourth Super Cup trophy. The season ended with only a second place in the league. In 2013–14, Benfica's performances worsened, and the team finished the league in fourth place. Jorge Rito did not renew his contract and was replaced by Mariano Ortega. On 3 April 2016, Benfica, who had beaten rivals FC Porto in the semi-finals the day before, beat Lisbon rivals Sporting in the final and conquered their fifth Portuguese Cup, ending a four-year trophy drought.\nCurrent squad.\nGoalkeepers\nLeft wingers\nRight wingers\nLine players\nLeft backs\nCentral backs\nRight backs\nResults in international competition.\nNote: Benfica score is always listed first.H = home match; A = away match\nHonours.\nAccording to Benfica's official website\nWomen's honours.\nAccording to Benfica's official website"

His successor at the Illawarra Cutters was another former Illawarra player, Ian Millward.\nFollowing the announcement of the sacking of incumbent first grade coach, Steve Price, McGregor was elevated to coach of the top tier team in May 2014, initially until the end of the 2014 season. Following improved form, McGregor was announced as the full-time head coach for the next three seasons until the end of 2017.\nIn 2015, McGregor coached St. George Illawarra to finish in 8th position. This was the club's first finals appearance since 2011.\nIn 2017, many predicted St. George Illawarra go finish in the bottom four, due to a disappointing 2016 season, where the club were extremely poor in attack. In Round 1 2017, St. George Illawarra beat Penrith 42–10. St. George Illawarra would go on to lose in Round 2, but win the next 5 games in a row. Due to improved form, the McGregor was re-signed by the club on 8 June 2017, until the end of 2019. In the second half of the 2017 season, St. George Illawarra suffered a terrible drop in form with the club winning only 4 of the last 11 matches. This drop in form culminated with the club losing against Canterbury in the last round of the regular season. Before the match, St. George Illawarra only needed victory over their lower placed opponents to qualify for the finals as North Queensland had lost the earlier match. Due to St. George Illawarra losing the game, North Queensland went on to finish in 8th place and qualify for the finals. This eventually lead to North Queensland reaching the 2017 NRL Grand Final.\nIn the 2018 season, McGregor guided St. George Illawarra to a 7th-place finish as they qualified for the finals. At one point, they were sitting equal first on the ladder after 20 rounds but for the third season in a row, the club suffered a late season form slump winning just 4 from the remaining 11 matches. McGregor himself came under criticism for the form slump with some sections of the media claiming his job was on the line. In week one of the finals, the Saints faced Brisbane at Suncorp Stadium with the home side being heavily fancied before the match. St. George Illawarra went on to defeat Brisbane 48–18. \nThe following week, St. George Illawarra played South Sydney in the second elimination final. They led late until the end of the match when Adam Reynolds kicked three field goals to win the match for Souths 13–12.\nOn 18 April 2019, McGregor was granted a two-year contract extension by St. George Illawarra, keeping him at the club until the end of the 2021 season. After St. George Illawarra's 40–18 defeat against Penrith in Round 18 of the 2019 NRL season which left St. George Illawarra in 14th position on the ladder, McGregor came under intense media criticism after he chose to rest Ben Hunt for the game. \nIn the 2019 NRL season, McGregor coached the joint venture to their worst finish; 15th place. The only thing keeping St. George Illawarra from 16th place were the Gold Coast Titans. McGregor was given a contract extension after the club won four of their first six games. McGregor led the club to win just 4 of their last 18 games, a period which included five-match losing streaks from rounds 7–11 and again from rounds 16–20.\nIn the COVID-19 interrupted 2020 NRL season, the St. George Illawarra side lost its first four matches, including a 0-18 loss to a weakened New Zealand Warriors team, and a 22-2 loss to the last-placed Canterbury-Bankstown side, leading to renewed speculation about McGregor's future. \nOn 13 August 2020, McGregor was terminated as head coach of the St. George Illawarra club. He won his final game on 14 August 2020 when his side upset the Parramatta Eels with a tough 14-12 win.\nOn September 15 2021, McGregor was appointed an assistant coach of the NSW Blues. \nOn November 5 2021, McGregor joined the Parramatta Eels coaching staff as a consultant for the 2022 NRL Season.On 28 September 2023, it was announced that the NSWRL board had decided not to renew McGregor's contract following another series defeat."

        "text": "The Myanmar national cricket team is the team that represents the country of Myanmar in international cricket matches. It has been an affiliate member of the International Cricket Council (ICC) since 2006 and an associate member since 2017.\nIn April 2018, the ICC decided to grant full Twenty20 International (T20I) status to all its members. Therefore, all Twenty20 matches played between Myanmar and other ICC members after 1 January 2019 have the full T20I status.\nHistory.\nBritish rule.\nCricket in Myanmar dates back to when Burma was a province of British India. The British brought the game there, as they did to the rest of India, and the game progressed to the level where the Marylebone Cricket Club played two two-day first class matches there on a tour to India in 1926/1927. The first of these was played at the Gymkhana ground in Rangoon against a Rangoon Gymkhana cricket team. That game was drawn with the MCC on top after forcing the home side to follow-on. The second game was against the Burma team themselves at the BAA Ground, also in Rangoon. The MCC won this game restricting Burma to low scores in both their innings, and only having to chase 7 runs to win in their second innings. These remains the country's only first class games.\nReemergence.\nFollowing independence cricket remained very much a minority sport in Myanmar, and was nowhere to be seen between 1988 and 1995. In 2002 the game was seeing a resurgence, with a seven team league organised by former Bengal first class player Naresh Kumar , with some former first class players taking part in games attended by around 250 people. Cricket has also been featured on TV news reports. The Myanmar Cricket Federation received a visit from the ICC in 2004 and became an affiliate member of the organisation in 2006. The game is currently played primarily by ex-pats, but the game has recently been introduced into schools.\n2006 ACC Trophy.\nJust two months after gaining ICC membership, Myanmar headed to Malaysia to take part in the 2006 ACC Trophy for the first time. They had a very poor tournament, with a series of heavy defeats to Kuwait (by 9 wickets in 10 overs), to Hong Kong (by 422 runs, with Myanmar being bowled out for 20) and to Bhutan (by 9 wickets in 6.5 overs; Bhutan had also received heavy defeats in their previous matches).\nThe nadir of their tournament came against Nepal, where Myanmar were bowled out for just 10 off 12.1 overs after losing the toss and being sent in; no batsman scored more than one, the innings included five ducks, and extras top scored with five (three leg byes and two wides). Nepal hit three off the first ball, followed by three wides that went for five, and then hit another three from the second legitimate delivery to win by ten wickets. Some critics called it the greatest mismatch in the history of international cricket, and the score of 10 is the lowest in any level of men's international cricket.\n2009–present.\nWith the separation of the ACC Trophy into Elite and Challenge divisions, Myanmar have since competed in the Challenge divisions in both 2009, in which they came last, and 2010. Despite the cricket being of a lesser quality than the Elite division, Myanmar have continued to suffer from heavy defeats.\nIn August 2017, Myanmar played cricket at the 2017 Southeast Asian Games after a five-year absence from international cricket. In the 50-over tournament, they won only one out of four matches, defeating Indonesia by four wickets. This was Myanmar's first ever victory in international cricket. In the 20-over tournament, they lost both their games.\nMyanmar played their first T20I on 26 July 2023, against Bhutan, during the 2023 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier.\nMyanmar registered their first ever victory in T20Is against China on 29 January 2024 in the 2024 ACC Men's Challenger Cup.\nRecords.\nInternational Match Summary\n\"Last updated 30 January 2024\"\nTwenty20 International.\nT20I record versus other nations\n\"Records complete to T20I #2442.

        "title": "American darts",
        "text": "American darts is a regional variant of the game of darts, most often found in eastern Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and parts of New York state. American darts originated in eastern Pennsylvania in the early 20th century; this style of darts was first played in both the Philadelphia area and the Coal Region of Northeastern Pennsylvania.\nDespite the name of this variant, the most common form of darts in the United States is the traditional English version.\nDartboard.\nThere are a number of differences between an American board and a traditional English board. American darts uses a board made of basswood, using the end grain. High-quality boards have rotatable centers that can be turned so the board will wear more evenly.\nEmbedded in the board are thin steel wires that separate the board into scoring sections, as opposed to the wider steel dividers placed onto the surface of traditional boards. On those English boards, the wider steel makes it much more likely that the dart will hit the steel divider and bounce off onto the floor. Since the dividers on an American board are much thinner, usually around , and they are completely pressed into the surface, it is extremely unlikely that the dart will bounce off from hitting the steel.\nThe scoring areas on an American darts board are also laid out differently from an English board. The center bullseye (or cork) on an American board is one section; there is no \"inner\" and \"outer\" bullseye. Additionally, unlike the English board, the treble ring is not halfway between the outer edge and the bullseye; rather triple is itself on the outer edge, and the double ring is directly adjacent to it, just inside the triple ring. The remainder of the board is the single scoring area. The bullseye is colored red, the single area is uncolored, the double ring is red, and the outermost triple ring is uncolored. The entire scoring area is bounded by a large out-of-bounds blue ring.\nThe number sequence (20, 1, 18, 4, etc.) is the same as on an English dart board.\nHeight and distance.\nAn \"American\" board is mounted a few inches lower, and a few inches closer, than the more commonly seen \"English\" board. The center of the cork is from the floor. The distance is set at from the \"back\" of the dartboard. This would result in a distance of from the center of the cork to the throw line. On the other hand, the ABDA (American Baseball Darts Association) sets the distance at from the \"front\" of the board. This is from the centre of the cork to the throw line.\nDarts.\nThe darts are made of wooden barrels, fletched with turkey feather flights glued in place. A metal tip assembly is bored into the end of the wooden section. The exposed (visible) end of the tip assembly is either tempered steel or brass. The other end of the tip assembly (the section inserted inside the wood barrel) had a lead weight attached. Placing this heavier end of the metal assembly inside the wood tends to move the center of gravity away from the tip and towards the center of the dart, creating a stable flight.\nStandard sized American darts are long, and are known as size #1 darts. These darts weigh anywhere from , depending on the wood and metals used.\nGeneral scoring rules.\nThe thin wires separating the scoring sections on the board occasionally overlap slightly, due to the manufacturing process. Any dart splitting the wires (landing in the tiny area where two wires overlap) is credited in the shooter's favor. For example, if the dart splits the wires separating the two and three point zones, the player is awarded three points. If the dart splits the wires separating the three point zone and the blue ring, the player is credited with three points.\nSince the shafts of the darts are made from wood, and the tips are sharpened metal, it is possible for a dart to stick into the shaft of a previously thrown dart. The scoring of any dart is determined by where the tip of the dart lands, and since the tip of this dart is not in the board, the dart that is stuck in the barrel of another scores no points at all. It is considered the same as if it missed the board.\nEtiquette.\nOne notable etiquette difference from traditional \"English\" style darts is that in American darts, each player leaves the thrown darts in the board for the next player, rather than retrieving them.\nThis is done for several practical reasons:\nGames.\nBaseball.\nThe standard game is Baseball (also known as \"1 to 9\"). Players take turns shooting three darts at each inning. They begin with inning number one and continue in order until they have shot nine innings. Darts landing in the thin uncolored outermost ring are worth 3 points. The red ring is worth 2 points, and the inside area is worth 1 point. Darts landing in the bullseye are worth zero. Also, any dart landing outside the triple ring do not score (the large blue ring beyond the treble ring is merely the out-of-boards marker, and is not a scoring area).\nThe maximum score in each inning is nine points—all three darts landing in the three-point area. A perfect game in Baseball would be a score of 81. This would consist of 27 consecutive darts (over nine innings), all landing in the three-point zone. This has never been achieved. The highest known score shot in tournament play is 72.\nRecreational shooters will average around 20 points in game. Regular shooters will score in the low 30s, competitive league shooters will average in the upper 30's to lower 40's, and the best shooters will \"average\" in the upper 40s to 50. Of course, single game scores can be much higher (see the 72 mentioned above).\nIf the game is tied at the end of nine innings, extra innings are shot to determine the winner, starting with inning ten.\nSome regional variations in scoring for Baseball exist. In the most common variation, the competitors mutually agree to a minimum required score per frame. For example, if the agreed minimum score is five, if the shooter or the team does not score at least five points for the number, the shooter or team receives no points for that frame. Generally, the greater the number of shooters on a team, the higher the minimum score per frame required.\nThe American Baseball Darts Association presides over the largest American dart tournaments. This includes the annual Pennsylvania State Dart Tournament, the largest American Darts event.\nStrikeout.\nStrikeout is a common game played in the region, but can be played just as easily on a traditional board as on an American Style board. The game is for individual players or teams.\nTo start, each team throws one dart at the cork (or bullseye). Whichever team is closest to the center shoots first, the next closest team will shoot second, etc.\nThe first player shoots three darts, scoring the in standard \"traditional\" manner. Thus, a triple 20 is worth sixty points, a double 9 is worth eighteen points, a single 11 is worth eleven points, and so on. The center cork is worth 100 points. Players attempt to accumulate as many points as possible with their three darts. If playing as a team, the teammates shoot in sequence, with their individual scores added together to get their team score.\nThe key rule of Strikeout is that the first dart to land in the 20-number scoring area sets that shooter's \"number\" for the remainder of the inning. Once that number is set, that number is the only number that can be scored for the remainder of the inning (with the exception of the center cork, which is always in play, regardless of the set \"number\"); the other nineteen numbers on the board are worth zero points for the remainder of the shooter's inning. So if a player throws his or her first dart at 20, in order to score the maximum possible points, but he or she misses and it lands in the 1 area, that player has established 1 as their number for their second and third darts. Thus, even if the last two darts were to land in 20, they would be scored as zero. Once a player establishes a poor number, the best strategy for the remainder of the inning is to just shoot at the 100-point cork, since even three darts in triple 1 would score only nine points. If the first dart does not land in one of the 20 scoring numbers (either misses the board completely, or hits the 100-point cork), the \"number\" is not yet established for that inning, and the shooter is still free to score in any of the 20 numbers on the second dart (likewise for the third dart, if both the first two darts do not land in any of the 20 numbers).\nSince the first dart sets the number, players will sometimes shun shooting at the 20, since a small miss will result in either a 1 or a 5 being set as the number. Often two adjacent numbers with solid values, such as 11/14 and 10/15 are chosen by lower-skilled players, since a small miss there does not result is such a large penalty (if you miss the 14 you'll still land in the 11, etc.).\nThe maximum score in an inning is 300 points (3 corks). The maximum score for a team (two players) is 600 points. Corks and scoring numbers can be combined; for instance, if a player shoots a double 20, a cork, and a single 20, that player would score 160 points (40 + 100 + 20). If a player shoots a single 20, a double 5, and a single 20, that player would score 40 points (20 + 0 + 20), since the dart in the 5 would not count (20 having been established as the \"number\" for that inning).\nThe name Strikeout comes from the method of eliminating players/teams. Once a player/team has finished shooting, their score is the target for the next team. The next team must \"beat\" the score established by the previous team (ties count as failing to beat the score). So if the first team scores 180 points, the next team must score at least 181 points. If they do not, they are given a strike, as in baseball. Once a team accumulates three strikes, they are eliminated from the game. The last team remaining is the winner.\nExample 3-team game:\nTeam 2 is the winner"

        "title": "Newcastle Rugby League",
        "text": "The Newcastle Rugby League is a local rugby league football competition in Newcastle, Australia. It is one of the oldest rugby league competitions in Australia, founded in 1910. A Newcastle representative team was also assembled from players in the League during most of the 20th century. The first grade competition also comprises the NSWRL Presidents Cup Northern Conference.\nHistory.\nThe original franchise from Newcastle competed in the inaugural Sydney Rugby League premiership of 1908 but withdrew after the 1909 season to form the local competition under the banner of the Northern Branch of the NSWRL.\nThe four original teams were Central Newcastle (Blue &amp; White), North Newcastle (Light &amp; Dark Blue vertical stripes), South Newcastle (Red &amp; White) and West Newcastle (Red &amp; Green). The season kicked off 14 May 1910 with South playing West and Central playing Northern Suburbs. South Newcastle finished the season on top of the ladder; the final was played in front of 2500 spectators at Hamilton League Ground, with Central overcoming South 13–4.\nThe 1911 season saw the previous minor premiers South slump to the bottom of the ladder. The final was played in front of 4000 spectators and saw North victorious over Central 10–2. 1911 saw the Combined Newcastle &amp; Hunter team Tour Queensland, defeating the Queensland State team in all matches played.\nNewcastle played against the touring New Zealand team in a tight match almost pulling off an upset before going down 21–20.\nThe 1912 season saw the addition of East Newcastle, playing in Black and White. They were immediately competitive and made the grand final.\nThe First World War saw a halt to the competition for 1917 and 1918. Although the Newcastle Morning Herald did continue to publish results for competition games for those two years. The NSW Football League sacked most of the local officials following an early game of the 1917 season in which the Western Suburbs Club played a disqualified player. The competition was thrown into turmoil and the season was abandoned. The 1918 season was also abandoned because the officials were still serving their suspensions and the player shortage had worsened. \n1919 saw a split, with two smaller competitions held – the \"Lilywhites\" or clubs faithful to the NSWRL, composed of Eastern Suburbs and Northern Suburbs, and the \"Bolsheviks\" or rebels composed of South, Central, North and West.\n1920 saw the competition reunited when the Newcastle Rugby League (NRL) was officially formed and expanded to six teams as Kurri Kurri competed for the first time. The Newcastle Sports Ground (No1) was officially opened 16 September 1922 on land donated by the Australian Agricultural Company. The opening was marked between Western Suburbs (Sydney) and a Newcastle representative side, with Newcastle winning 20–16. The first game under lights was played at the Newcastle Coursing and Sporting Club (later the Newcastle Greyhound track) at Hamilton South in 1928.\nThe 1930s saw the emergence of the Coalfields teams (such as Cessnock Goannas in 1930). Football games were first broadcast on the radio in this decade, but only after considerable debate by Newcastle Rugby League. The record score was established in this decade on 27 July 1939, when Northern Suburbs defeated Morpeth-East Maitland 127–16. North winger Alf Fairhall scored 11 tries and kicked 14 goals, with the game called off 20 minutes early. \nThe Country Rugby League (CRL) formed in 1934 and became the governing body for the sport of rugby league in areas of New South Wales outside the Sydney metropolitan area, such as Newcastle. \nIn the mid 1950s,the major football clubs were opening large licensed Social Clubs. Bar and poker machine revenue from these clubs provided a new source of cash to fund and develop the game. Also in this era, the 'six-yard rule' was introduced to keep both the attacking and defending teams from being within three yards of the play the ball. \nPrior to 1960, if the minor premiers were defeated in the playoffs, they then had the right to challenge the winner of the final to a grand final match. The Second Division competition started in 1960 with nine teams, growing to 23 for the 1961 season. Macquarie also entered the league in 1960. In 1962, the local Television station (NBN 3) began transmitting to Newcastle audiences. \nFrom 1963 to 1965, the Newcastle representative team won 15 consecutive matches, including wins in three Country Championships and wins against South Africa and France, and the famous victories in the State Cup. This Cup, in which Sydney teams played NSW Country Divisional teams in a knockout competition, was launched in 1964 by the NSWRL. Newcastle defeated South Sydney, North Sydney, the all-conquering St George and Parramatta to win the Cup. This side featured names such as Terry Pannowitz, Allan Buman, and Dave Brown (captain). \nIn 1968, the Central Newcastle club relocated from the inner-city to Charlestown and became Central-Charlestown, popularly known as 'The Butcher Boys'. \nDuring the 1970s, the ten District clubs engaged in an impressive line-up of high profile Captain/Coaches. Great Britain international Terry Clawson (South Newcastle), immortal and Australian international Johnny Raper (Western Suburbs), Australian international Brian 'Chicka' Moore (Macquarie) and Australian international Alan Thomson (Lakes United), to name a few. In 1971, the 'six tackle rule' was introduced. In 1978, foundation club Northern Suburbs became North Newcastle after it enlarged its district to include Raymond Terrace and Nelson Bay. \nIn 1988, the league changed majorly with the introduction of the Newcastle Knights into the NSWRL competition, the first representation of the Newcastle and Hunter region since the Newcastle Rebels departed after the 1909 season. \nAs a result, the 1990s saw the Newcastle Knights attract the lion's share of the spectators in Newcastle and support for local clubs suffered. This downturn was offset to a certain extent when former Knights players began to filter into the local competition. The drift of players boosted the profile of the local league, which was no more evident than when Steve Linnane led Kurri to a trifecta of premierships in 1993, 1994 and 1995. \nThe 2000s saw the league implement a 'salary cap' and a 'points system' for players signing with a 'new' club. This innovation was designed to control spending and to keep clubs alive and well. A joint venture launched in 2009 by the Knights and the Newcastle Rugby League was labelled 'the Player Placement Program', designed to allow Knights players not required by their club on a weekend, to play in the local competition.\n2020 saw the competition cancelled for the first time in over one hundred years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. With restrictions easing, a decision was made to implement a two tiered amateur competition. First Grade would feature Lakes United, Western Suburbs, Cessnock, Maitland, Central and Souths. Reserve Grade would see representation from Western Suburbs, Lakes United, Cessnock, Maitland, Central, Souths and Kurri Kurri. Of further note, Maitland also elected to participate in the Presidents Cup, spreading their resources across the two Newcastle competitions as well as the New South Wales based Presidents Cup, which they won. Cessnock defeated South Newcastle in the First Grade Grand Final.\nThe 2021 season featured the regular clubs, as well as both Wyong and The Entrance, forming a 10 team, 18 round competition. The Entrance will contest the competition for the first time in their history. As well as this, the Major Premiers also now advance to meet title winners from Illawarra, Ron Massey Cup and a wildcard in a conference style President's Cup at the end of the year. Unfortunately, the competition was interrupted by COVID-19 restrictions placed on the Hunter region, with a decision made to cancel the competition prior to any finals being played. Maitland Pickers had secured the Minor Premiership, but there would be no Major Premiers for season 2021. No President's Cup tournament was contested.\nSeason 2022 saw the Maitland Pickers claim the minor premiership with 31 competition points, with Central Newcastle (29), Macquarie Scorpions (22), Cessnock Goannas (22) and South Newcastle (22) rounding out the top five. On 11 September 2022, Maitland Pickers claimed their 13th premiership with a 40–4 victory over Macquarie Scorpions at McDonald Jones Stadium in Newcastle. On 25 September 2022, Maitland defended their Presidents Cup crown with a 36–12 win over The Hills Bulls. 2022 NSWRL Presidents Cup. \nSeason 2023 included The Northern Hawks, bumping the number of teams in the league to 11. All teams will compete in the overarching 2023 NSWRL Presidents Cup. 2023 saw the modern-day version of the Newcastle Rebels, a team constructed of the best talent from the Newcastle Rugby League, return to the Men's Country Championships. Maitland Pickers won the Premiership to secure back to back titles, defeating South Newcastle Lions 46-10.\nPremiers.\nPast winners of the Newcastle RL Premiership\nTeam of the Century.\nIn 2008, rugby league football's centennial year in Australia, the Newcastle Rugby League named its 'Team of the Century':"

The competition was founded in 1947 as a junior competition for the Newcastle club, Lakes United. The competition rapidly expanded and grew, so much so that in 1967, it was upgraded to full membership of the Country Rugby League as Group 12. In 1981, it was upgraded and renamed Central Coast Division. The division covers the entire region of the Central Coast from Woy Woy and Umina in the south up to Budgewoi and Gwandalan in the north.\nCurrent Clubs.\nTeams Timeline.\nThis timeline indicates the highest grade played. \nTeam Numbers.\nTeam numbers obtained and compiled from results published in the newspapers, \"Central Coast Express\", \"Wyong Shire Advocate\" and \"Central Coast Express Advocate\".\nPrevious Teams.\nFirst Grade.\nCurrent clubs Ourimbah, Wyong and later Woy Woy participated in the Central Coast Rugby League competitions that were held in 1915 and between 1919 and 1936. Teams from Gosford, Erina, Kincumber and Terrigal also competed, predecessors to the current clubs. The following teams were also involved: \nThe following teams have participated in Central Coast First or 'A' Grade competitions since 1947: \nWyong and Morisset combined in 1957 to field teams in A, B, C and D grades. Mount Penang competed in Under 18s from 1969 to 1975. The Gosford Townies fielded grade teams from 1948 to 1999, and junior teams from the 1950s.\nSecond Division/Open Age.\nA Second Division competition ran from 1976 to 2005. Clubs that were promoted to First Division / Grade were Toukley, Northern Lakes (Munmorah), Berkeley Vale and Kincumber. Junior club Budgewoi-Buff Point ran Second Division teams from 1978 to 2002 and in 2005.\nCentral Wyong competed in Second Division from 1977 to 2005, until 1988 as Grand Hotel. The club entered First Grade in 2006, dropped back to lower grades between 2007 and 2011, spent 2012 in the Newcastle &amp; Hunter competition, and returned to Central Coast First Grade between 2013 and 2015. Central Wyong ran junior teams from 1994 to 2015. \nThis competition is now known as Open Age.\nThe teams that competed in Second Division were:\nCentral Coast teams in other competitions.\nIn 2003 four Central Coast teams (Erina, Ourimbah, The Entrance and Woy Woy) decided to field teams in the then Jim Beam Cup, the third highest ranked NSW Competition (below NRL and NSW Cup) featuring mainly Sydney-based competition teams. All teams remained in the Central Coast first grade competition with effectively reserve grade teams. After three seasons, all apart from The Entrance withdrew from the competition. The Entrance Tigers entered teams in the competition until 2007 and again, under different competition names, between 2010 and 2014. The Entrance Tigers won the Jim Beam Cup in 2003 and 2007 and the Ron Massey Cup in 2014.\nAlso in 2003, Wyong entered the Newcastle Rugby League Competition which was perceived to be a stronger league. Wyong remained part of the Central Coast junior competition and up until 2006, also fielded senior teams locally. Wyong were runner's up in the Newcastle Rugby League in 2007 and First Grade Premiers in 2009. This was Wyong's third stint in Newcastle rugby league competitions, having previously competed in Second Grade in 1912, 1913 and 1914; in Third Grade in 1945 and in a Southern Newcastle competition in 1946.\nIn 2013 Wyong left the Newcastle competition in a dispute over salary caps and instead entered a team in the NSW Cup, the second highest level of senior rugby league in NSW after the NRL. For two seasons, Wyong was the only team in that competition without a direct affiliation with an NRL club. At the same time Wyong returned to the Central Coast first grade competition after a six-year absence. In 2015, Wyong affiliated with the Sydney Roosters.\nThe Berkeley Vale Panthers competed in the NSWRL Sydney Metropolitan Women's Rugby League competition in 2015, 2016 and 2017.\nSenior Competition Premiers (2010–present).\nThe highest grade of senior rugby league in the Central Coast Division is the First Grade competition. In 2017 ten teams have entered the first grade competition; all ten also field teams in the Reserve Grade competition. Ten teams are competing the 2017 'Open Age' competition, a league for senior players at a standard below the first/reserve grade competition.

        "text": "Bob D. Sutton (born January 28, 1951) is an American football coach serving as a senior defensive assistant of the Jacksonville Jaguars of the National Football League (NFL). Sutton previously was the defensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs. Sutton served as the head football coach at the United States Military Academy from 1991 to 1999, compiling a record of 44–55–1.\nCoaching career.\nSutton's first job in the coaching ranks came as a graduate assistant under Bo Schembechler at Michigan in 1972 and 1973. In 1974, he moved on to Syracuse University where he served as linebackers coach for the Orange. After just one year he began the first of two stints at Western Michigan University then onto the University of Illinois, where he was defensive coordinator and linebackers coach from 1977 to 1979. He returned to Western Michigan as offensive coordinator in 1980 and 1981. In 1982, he spent one season as running backs coach at North Carolina State University before beginning a long association with the United States Military Academy in 1983.\nArmy.\nSutton spent eight years as an assistant coach at Army before being named the head coach in 1991.\nHis nine-year tenure as the head football coach at Army (1991 to 1999) is second in length only to Earl \"Red\" Blaik. Sutton compiled a record of 44–55–1 and guided the 1996 Army squad to a 10–2 record, an appearance in the Independence Bowl, and a top 25 finish in both major polls. For his efforts that season, Sutton was awarded the Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award.\nNew York Jets.\nSutton made the transition to the NFL coaching ranks with the New York Jets in 2000, beginning his tenure with the Jets as a linebackers coach before serving as the team's defensive coordinator from 2006 to 2008, senior assistant/linebackers coach from 2009 to 2011, and as assistant head coach/linebackers in 2012.\nKansas City Chiefs.\nIn January 2013 Sutton was named defensive coordinator for the Kansas City Chiefs under new head coach Andy Reid. Unlike other NFL defensive coordinators, Sutton was distinguished by his \"cordial and cerebral demeanor\" which was the \"calming and refreshing opposite of the drill sergeant caricature\". The Chiefs finished in the top seven in scoring defense in each of Sutton’s first four seasons, ranking second in 2014.\nDespite the gradual year-over-year improvement in the Chiefs' win–loss record, Sutton drew growing criticism as the defense cost them playoff games, starting when the team blew the 38–10 lead to lose 44–45 to the Indianapolis Colts in 2014, and then suffered eliminations at the hands of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Tennessee Titans, and New England Patriots in the 2016–2018 postseasons; in these latter three losses the Chiefs had home advantage and surrendered a considerable amount of rushing yards. The 2018 season was generally a success for the Chiefs, largely due to an offense led by young quarterback Patrick Mahomes who led the league in points and yards per game. However, the defense ranked 31st in yards allowed (405.5), 24th in yards per play (5.85), and 24th in points per game (26.3), and giving up an average of 40.2 points in the five losses including those to the Los Angeles Rams and Seattle Seahawks, while the only bright spot was leading the league in sacks and quarterback hurries. The \"Kansas City Star's\" Sam Mellinger noted that \"The offense was a rocket ship, especially early, which meant the defense was often playing with the lead in obvious passing situations. That played to the group’s strength, which was the pass rush, and away from its weaknesses — stopping the run and quick passes\". Sutton had reportedly lost the support of players and coaches who felt that his \"lack of adjustments has been a non-stop frustration\", so he was relieved of his duties two days after the loss to the Patriots in the AFC Championship Game, when the Chiefs defense twice failed to hold a 4th quarter lead and surrendered several 3rd and long conversions on New England's game-winning touchdown drive in overtime. The overtime drive highlighted Sutton's weaknesses that cost him his job, as the Patriots largely converted those 3rd downs on near-identical plays. Notably, CBS commentator Tony Romo was successfully able to predict the plays based on the formation, which led to even more criticism of Sutton.\nThe following season, under new defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo, Kansas City posted an identical 12–4 record despite injuries to Mahomes and several other key offensive pieces, as an improved defense gave Kansas City a more balanced team that went on to win the Super Bowl.\nAtlanta Falcons.\nIn February 2019, the Atlanta Falcons named Bob Sutton a Senior Assistant.\nJacksonville Jaguars.\nSutton became the senior defensive assistant of the Jacksonville Jaguars\nPersonal life.\nBob Sutton earned his physical education degree from Eastern Michigan University. He and his wife, Debbie, have a son, a daughter, and three grandchildren."

His best season was in 2005 when he caught 57 passes for 725 yards. During the 2006 offseason, the Chargers signed Parker to a new five-year deal.\nIn 2006, Parker and then #1 wide receiver Keenan McCardell both ended the season with zero touchdown catches. Teammates LaDainian Tomlinson, tight end Antonio Gates and wide receiver Vincent Jackson accounted for the majority of the Chargers' scores.\nParker's 2006 season came to a disappointing end in the Divisional Round of the playoffs. In a game the Chargers lost to the New England Patriots by three points, Parker dropped two passes and fumbled a crucial third-quarter punt, which led to three points for the opposing team.\nIn 2007, Eric Parker injured his toe during training camp. This led to the Chargers putting him on season-ending injured reserve. He was released by the team on July 23, 2008.\nIn March 2009, Eric Parker joined the coaching staff of the San Diego Chargers as a wide receivers and conditioning assistant.\nHe also coaches wrestling at Helix Charter High School."

        "text": "The Canberra Region Rugby League competition is more commonly known as the Canberra Raiders Cup, covering the Australian Capital Territory and surrounding New South Wales towns Queanbeyan, Goulburn and Yass. The competition is run under the auspices of the Country Rugby League and players are eligible for selection in the Canberra Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\nHistory.\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs competed for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\nHistoric Competitions.\nGroup 8 Second Division/Crookwell RL.\nClubs.\nSource:"

        "title": "World Grand Prix (darts)",
        "text": "The BoyleSports World Grand Prix is a PDC darts tournament traditionally held in Dublin, Ireland every October, but has taken place in Leicester, England since 2021. Its original venue was the Casino Rooms in Rochester, Kent in 1998 and 1999, and then for one year only in 2000 at the Crosbie Cedars Hotel in Rosslare, County Wexford. In 2001, the tournament moved further north to the Citywest in Dublin. In 2009, the tournament moved from the Reception Hall at the main Citywest Hotel, to the newly completed bigger venue on site, the Citywest Hotel Convention Centre. In 2012, the tournament moved back to the Reception Hall for that year, before returning to the Convention Centre in 2013. \nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 tournament was held at the Ricoh Arena, Coventry, and since 2021, it has been held at the Morningside Arena, Leicester. When the World Grand Prix was founded in 1998, it replaced the earlier World Pairs tournament which ran from 1995 to 1997.\nThe World Grand Prix was sponsored by bookmakers Paddy Power from 2001 to 2003, before Sky Bet took over in 2004. The subsidiary Sky Poker was the tournament's sponsor in 2008. In 2010, online gambling company Bodog became the event's title sponsor, while PartyPoker.com took over as the main sponsor in 2011. In 2016, Unibet took over as sponsor, with BoyleSports sponsoring the event since 2019.\nAlthough he has dominated the event with eleven title wins, Phil Taylor has been knocked out of the World Grand Prix five times in the first round. In 2001, he lost 2–1 to qualifier Kevin Painter. in 2004, he was beaten 2–0 by Andy Callaby. in 2007, he lost 2–0 to Adrian Gray. in 2015, he was beaten 2–0 by Vincent van der Voort, and in 2016, he was beaten 2–1 by Steve West.\nThe current champion is Luke Humphries, who defeated Gerwyn Price, by a margin of 5–2, in the 2023 final to win his first major and first World Grand Prix title.\nTournament format.\nThe tournament is unusual in that it is the only televised event in which players must commence and finish each leg on a double (including the bullseye).\nThere have been several different formats for the tournament. The first event in 1998 was a straight knock-out tournament played in a setplay format with each set being contested over the best of three legs. The following year this changed to the best of five legs per set. Furthermore, a group stage was introduced in 1999, with there only being four seeded players for the event, all of whom reached the semi-finals. In 2000, the tournament reverted to being a straight knock-out and has remained so ever since.\nThe double-start format also makes landing a perfect nine-dart finish even more difficult, as it limits the number of combinations and guarantees that a player must finish on the bullseye (unless they start with one). There were two famous near misses in the first two years, the first with Phil Taylor in the 1998 final against Rod Harrington, when Taylor was distracted by loud commentary from Sid Waddell just before throwing the eighth dart (which Taylor hit) before he missed the bullseye; and the second in the 1999 semi final, when Harrington missed the bullseye against Taylor. The first nine-darter in Grand Prix history was eventually completed by Brendan Dolan in the 2011 semi-final against James Wade. In 2014, James Wade and Robert Thornton both hit perfect legs in the same match, the first time this happened in any televised event. On all three occasions, the leg started with a score of 160 (starting on double 20), followed by 180, followed by finishing 161 with treble 20, treble 17, and bullseye.\nRecords and statistics.\nNine-dart finishes.\nThree nine-darters have been thrown at the World Grand Prix. The first one was in 2011, the other two happened in the same game in 2014, notable as being the only televised match which has had nine-darters from both players.\nHigh averages.\nAn average over 100 in a match in the World Grand Prix has been achieved 20 times, of which Phil Taylor is responsible for 9.\nWorld Team Championship.\nThe World Team Championship event which preceded the introduction of this event was held between 1995 and 1997.\nMedia coverage.\nThe World Grand Prix has been broadcast in the UK by Sky Sports since the first tournament."

        "text": "Premier League Darts, known for sponsorship purposes in 2024 as BetMGM Premier League Darts, is a darts tournament which launched on 20 January 2005 on Sky Sports. Now played weekly from February to May, the event originally started as a fortnightly fixture in small venues around the United Kingdom. The tournament originally featured seven players, gradually expanded to ten by 2013, before reduced again from 2022 to eight players from the Professional Darts Corporation circuit competing in a knockout style format, with nights also hosted in Europe at different venues. The top four players in the PDC Order of Merit are joined by four wildcard selections to make up the eight-person field. Alongside the World Championship and the World Matchplay, it is considered part of the sport's Triple Crown.\nWhile active, Phil Taylor dominated the event, winning six of the thirteen tournaments he appeared in. He went unbeaten throughout the first three seasons before James Wade ended his 44 match run in the first match of the 2008 season. A new champion was to be crowned after Mervyn King defeated him in the 2009 semi-finals, where Wade defeated King 13–8 in the final, to pick up the £125,000 first prize. Taylor defeated Wade the following season to claim his fifth title in the competition in 2010, achieving two nine-dart finishes in the final, the only player to achieve this accomplishment.\nAlthough there have been seven overall winners of the Premier League, the league stage has been dominated by Taylor and Michael van Gerwen, with Taylor topping the table for each of the first eight editions and van Gerwen winning the next seven. In 2020, Glen Durrant became the third player to finish top after all league fixtures had been completed. He went on to win the title, meaning all three players both topped the table and won the play-offs at their first attempt.\nThe prize fund has risen from £265,000 in the early years of the tournament, steadily increasing each year for a prize fund of £1,000,000 in 2022. The winner currently receives £275,000.\nTelevision coverage.\nThe matches have been broadcast on Thursday nights on Sky Sports since the tournament inception. Originally the league alternated with Premier League Snooker one week and Premier League Darts the next. From 2006, the snooker moved to late autumn – giving the Premier League darts a straight weekly run in the spring.\nAmerican sports channel OLN aired the 2006 Premier League Darts season on a slight delay, in August 2006. In 2018, BBC America started airing Premier League Darts on Thursday nights. In 2020, BBC America started airing Premier League Darts on Sunday mornings.\nGerman sports channel Sport1 broadcasts most matches live on TV and gives coverages of a selection of matches.\nThe PDC announced in December 2017 that the contract with Sky Television for coverage of the Premier League had been extended to 2025.\nRecords and statistics.\nNine-dart finishes.\nFifteen nine-dart finishes have been thrown in the Premier League. The first one was in 2006, and the most recent one was in 2024.\nAppearances.\nSince the tournament made its debut in 2005, Phil Taylor made an appearance in every Premier League competition until his retirement following the 2018 PDC World Darts Championship. Raymond van Barneveld competed in every Premier League from 2006 to 2019. From 2005 until the 2010 tournament, the top six players in the PDC Order of Merit after the PDC World Darts Championship automatically qualified, with one wildcard (2005 and 2006) and two wildcards (2007–2010) chosen by either the PDC or Sky Sports. From the 2011 tournament, only the top four in the PDC Order of Merit automatically qualified, with four wildcards (2011 and 2012) chosen by both the PDC and Sky Sports. In 2013, the tournament grew from eight players to ten, with the top four players in the PDC Order of Merit automatically qualifying and six other players chosen as Wildcards on the basis of their performance in the past year or in earlier editions of the Premier League. In 2022, the tournament shrank back down to eight.\nIn 2024, both Luke Humphries and Luke Littler have made their debuts, with Littler, aged 17 years and 11 days when the 2024 campaign began, the youngest ever competitor in the Premier League.\nPremier League players and performance.\nWhen Gary Anderson withdrew from the 2019 season just before it began, Chris Dobey, Glen Durrant, Steve Lennon, Luke Humphries, John Henderson, Nathan Aspinall, Max Hopp, Dimitri Van den Bergh and Jeffrey de Zwaan were named as \"contenders\" to play in Anderson's place each of the first eight weeks. This format was reused for the 2020 season, with nine regular players and nine challengers; Henderson, Fallon Sherrock, Jonny Clayton, William O'Connor, Humphries, Bunting, Dobey, de Zwaan and Jermaine Wattimena were the challengers."

        "text": "The PDC World Darts Championship, known for sponsorship purposes as the Paddy Power World Darts Championship, organised by the Professional Darts Corporation (PDC), is a World Professional Darts Championship held annually in the sport of darts. The PDC world championship begins in December and ends in January and is held at Alexandra Palace in London and has been held there since 2008. It is the most prestigious of the PDC's tournaments, with the winner receiving the Sid Waddell Trophy, named in honour of the darts commentator Sid Waddell, who died in 2012. Along with the Premier League Darts and World Matchplay, it is considered part of the Triple Crown.\nThe PDC championship began in 1994 as the WDC World Darts Championship as one of the consequences of the split in darts, which saw the World Darts Council break away from the BDO. As a result of the settlement between the BDO and the WDC in 1997, the WDC became the PDC, and players were thenceforth free to choose which world championship to enter (but not both in the same year), as long as they met certain eligibility criteria. Both organisations continued to organize their own world championship until the 2020 editions, after which the BDO folded.\nThere have been twelve different winners since the tournament's inception. With 14 wins from 25 appearances, Phil Taylor has dominated the competition, last winning it in 2013. The other players to win it more than once are John Part (2003 &amp; 2008), Adrian Lewis (2011 &amp; 2012), Gary Anderson (2015 &amp; 2016), Michael van Gerwen (2014, 2017 &amp; 2019) and Peter Wright (2020 &amp; 2022). The one-time winners are the inaugural champion Dennis Priestley (1994), Raymond van Barneveld (2007), Rob Cross (2018), Gerwyn Price (2021),Michael Smith (2023) and Luke Humphries (2024).\nHistory.\nIn 1992, some high-profile players, including all previous winners of the BDO World Darts Championship still active in the game, formed the WDC (now PDC), and in 1994, held their first World Championship. Dennis Priestley won the inaugural competition.\nThe players who broke away were taking a significant gamble – the tournament was broadcast on satellite television rather than terrestrial, and from 1994 to 2001, the prize fund for the players in the WDC/PDC World Championship was lower than the prize fund in the BDO version, although the 1997 PDC World Champion received £45,000 compared to that year's BDO World Champion receiving £38,000. In 2002, the PDC prize fund overtook that of the BDO for the first time, and the PDC event now boasts the largest prize fund of any darts competition. In 2010, the prize fund reached £1 million for the first time, with the World Champion collecting £200,000.\nThe 2014 and 2015 PDC World Champions collected £250,000 for their respective wins. For the next, winner's share increased to £50,000 each year culminating in a 2018 prize fund of £1.8 million. The current prize fund for the tournament is £2.5 million with £500,000 to the winner, as set since the 2019 edition.\nIn 2020, the British Darts Organisation — which had held a separate version of the world championship since the split in 1994 — went into liquidation. As a result, the PDC version was briefly the only recognised world championship in darts until the 2022 WDF World Darts Championship was held.\nVenue.\nThe PDC World Darts Championship has been held at Alexandra Palace in London since 2008, having previously been held at the Circus Tavern in Purfleet, Essex, from 1994 to 2007. Currently, the play takes place inside the venue's West Hall, which has a capacity of 3,200.\nRecords and statistics.\nNine-dart finishes.\nFourteen nine-dart finishes have been thrown at the World Championship. The first one was in 2009.&lt;br&gt;\nTwo have been made in world finals: firstly by Adrian Lewis in 2011 and then Michael Smith in 2023.\nAverages.\nSince the breakaway of the PDC players, there has been much debate about the relative merits of the players within each organisation. The debate often focuses on the three-dart averages of players in matches.\nAn average over 100 in a match in the PDC World Championship has since been achieved 195 times. This is compared to 21 times in the BDO World Championship, following the 2019 event. In 2010 Phil Taylor became the first player to average over 100 in all six rounds of the tournament. He repeated this feat (though lost the final) in 2015 and Michael van Gerwen achieved it in 2017 and 2019.\nAn average of over 105 in a match in the PDC World Championship has been achieved 40 times. The highest match average ever in the BDO World Championship is 103.83 by Raymond van Barneveld in his quarter-final victory over John Walton in 2004.\nMedia.\nDomestic broadcaster.\nThe PDC World Championship has been broadcast live and in its entirety by Sky Sports in the UK since its inception. Since 2009 the tournament has been presented in High Definition (HD). Their coverage is currently presented from a studio overlooking the interior of the Alexandra Palace venue.\nThe current presenting team is as follows:\nPresenters:\nCommentators:\nCo-commentators/pundits:\nFormer presenters and commentators have been:\nOverseas broadcasters.\nDutch broadcaster SBS6, having covered the BDO World Darts Championship for many years, also covered the event until RTL7 took over broadcasting.

The second game in the series was \"PDC World Championship Darts 2008\" developed by Mere Mortals for the PlayStation 2, PC, PlayStation Portable, Wii and Xbox 360. A year later Rebellion Developments took over development of the series, releasing PDC World Championship Darts 2009 for the Wii and Nintendo DS.\nThe most recent PDC World Darts Championship console game to be released was \"PDC World Championship Darts Pro Tour\" a darts video game for the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. This game is the most comprehensive of the series featuring ten professional players and five official PDC tournaments including the PDC World Grand Prix, Las Vegas Desert Classic, PDC UK Open and the Holland Open.\nIn 2021 the PDC collaborated with Blueprint Gaming to develop \"PDC World Darts Championship\", an officially licensed slots game available to play on mobile devices and PC, the game was released in February 2021.\nSponsor.\nThe tournament has been sponsored by bookmaker Paddy Power in 2024.

        "title": "BDO World Darts Championship",
        "text": "The BDO World Darts Championship was a professional darts tournament organised by the British Darts Organisation (BDO) and held annually from 1978 to 2020. \nThe championship was first held at the Heart of the Midlands Nightclub in the English city of Nottingham. The following year it moved to the Jollees Cabaret Club, Stoke, where it stayed until 1985. From 1986 to 2019, it was held at the Lakeside Country Club in Frimley Green, Surrey. In 2020, the tournament was held at Indigo, part of the O2 entertainment district in London.\nIt was the only World Darts Championship until the 1993 split in darts, when 16 players, among them seven former champions, left the BDO and set up a rival darts circuit under the auspices of the World Darts Council (later the Professional Darts Corporation). The WDC/PDC staged its own annual World Championship from 1994 onwards.\nFrom its inception, the tournament was sponsored by Embassy cigarettes, a branch of Imperial Tobacco, and was thus often colloquially known as the Embassy. After the ban on tobacco advertising in the UK, the event was sponsored by its venue, the Lakeside Country Club, from 2004 onwards. The final edition, in 2020, was unable to find a sponsor.\nAfter the collapse of the British Darts Organisation in September 2020, the World Darts Federation announced plans to launch the WDF World Darts Championship, which took place for the first time in 2022.\nHistory.\nThe World Darts Championship was the brainchild of Mike Watterson, a sports promoter who had created the UK Snooker Championship and moved the World Snooker Championship to the Crucible Theatre in 1977. Watterson came up with the idea whilst sitting in a barber's chair waiting for a haircut. John Lowe, a friend of Watterson, convinced him that such an event would be easy to stage and suggested contacting Olly Croft, head of the British Darts Organisation, to run it. \nThe inaugural event was staged at the Heart of the Midlands club in Nottingham. Embassy cigarettes, which also sponsored the World Snooker Championship, put up the £10,500 prize fund and it would be broadcast on BBC2. Ten top players (Eric Bristow, John Lowe, Leighton Rees, Rab Smith, Alan Evans, Stefan Lord, Tim Brown, Bobby Semple, Nicky Virachkul and Barry Atkinson) were invited, with the remaining places going to qualifiers. The first tournament used the legs format for its matches, but from 1979 onwards Watterson introduced the sets and legs format, which has been used in darts ever since. It was won by Rees, who beat Lowe in the final.\nIn 1983, Keith Deller, a 23-year-old qualifier from Ipswich, beat the world's top three players back-to-back: John Lowe (world no. 3) in the quarter-final; reigning champion and World No. 2 Jocky Wilson in the semi-final, before an epic deciding set win against World no. 1 Eric Bristow in the final, to produce one of the greatest upsets in the sport's history.\nIn 1990 Singaporean (then-representing the USA) player Paul Lim hit the tournament's only 9-dart finish in the second round against Irishman Jack McKenna to win a bonus of £52,000 which was more than the eventual champion Phil Taylor received.\nThe finals of 1992, 1998 and 1999 all went into a deciding set play off, having reached 5 sets all and 2 legs all. In 1992, Phil Taylor defeated Mike Gregory in a sudden death leg, having reached 5 legs apiece. In 1998 Raymond van Barneveld beat Richie Burnett 4–2 in legs in the deciding set. Van Barneveld then repeated the same final set scoreline the following year against Ronnie Baxter.\nIn the final in 2007 Martin Adams was 6 sets up and, after the comfort break, Phill Nixon responded by winning the next 6 consecutive sets. Adams held on to take victory in the 13th and deciding set, to win the title that had eluded him for 14 years.\nIn 2019, Glen Durrant became the second player to win three consecutive BDO Men's World Championships after Eric Bristow between 1984 and 1986, while Mikuru Suzuki became the first Asian world darts champion in any form.\nIn 2020 the tournament was staged at the Indigo at The O2 in London. It was the first BDO World Darts Championship not held at the Lakeside Country Club since 1985. Wayne Warren became the oldest player ever to win a world title. It was also the last World Darts Championship organised by the BDO before the collapse of the company. The World Darts Federation announced plans to launch the WDF World Championship.\nAverages.\nSince the breakaway of the PDC players, there has been much debate about the relative merits of the players within each organisation. The debate often focuses on the three-dart averages of players in matches.\nSince the BDO Championship started in 1978, there have been 21 occasions where a player has achieved a three-dart average in excess of 100 during a match. Keith Deller was the first player to achieve an average of 100, in the quarter-final of 1985 against John Lowe, although he lost the match. It was not until Phil Taylor's semi-final of 1990 that another player managed a 100 average. Raymond van Barneveld has achieved the feat six times.\nWomen's Championship.\nThe women's World Championship started at the Lakeside in 2001 and Trina Gulliver has won ten championships. Her seventh title in 2007 took her overall record at the Lakeside to 20 match wins and having only dropped four sets in the history of the championship – one each in the finals of 2001, 2002 and 2007 and one in the quarter final of 2003. She managed a long run of 13 consecutive matches without dropping a single set, which started the semi-final of 2003 and ended in the final of 2007.\nIn 2008, Anastasia Dobromyslova won the championship, becoming the first player other than Trina Gulliver to take the title. Following her appearance at the Grand Slam of Darts in November 2008, Anastasia Dobromyslova joined the Professional Darts Corporation, hence leaving the BDO and did not defend her title. 2009 saw five-time runner-up Francis Hoenselaar complete the Masters/World Championship double by beating Gulliver 2–1 in the final. 2012 was the first final without Gulliver, who lost in the semi-final to the eventual champion Dobromyslova.\nThe finals:\nRecords.\n\"Since the split in darts two versions of the world championship have existed since 1994, this record section relates specifically to achievements in the BDO version.\"\nTelevision coverage.\nBBC Sport.\nThe tournament was broadcast in the UK by BBC Sport on television for nearly 40 years, from its inception in 1978 until the decision to drop the coverage after the 2016 tournament. The BBC's coverage was led by David Vine (1978), Peter Purves (1979–1983), Tony Gubba (1984–1990), David Icke (1989–1990), Eamonn Holmes (1991–1992), Dougie Donnelly (1993–1998), John Inverdale (2000) and Ray Stubbs (1999 and 2001–2009). Twice world finalist Bobby George was a pundit on the BBC's coverage from 1998. Colin Murray succeeded Stubbs as presenter from 2010–2016. Murray was assisted by Rob Walker.\nTony Green was the longest-serving member of the BBC commentary team, covering the event from the first championship in 1978 until the end of the BBC's coverage in 2016. As the BBC shared coverage and commentators from 2012 until 2016, Green was also heard on ESPN and BT Sport in later years. He only missed the event once during his 38-year career due to illness in 2011 and he was replaced by BBC Radio 5 Live's Vassos Alexander. Alexander then stayed in the commentary box every year until 2016.\nThe rest of the commentary team changed over the years with David Vine (1978), Sid Waddell (1978–1994), Tony Green (1978-2016), 1994 BDO world champion John Part (1995–2007) and David Croft who covered the tournament for 10 years on BBC TV and radio until 2012. He was replaced by Jim Proudfoot of talkSPORT in 2013, who went on to cover the tournament in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018 with different broadcasters. John Rawling began commentating in 2014 with BBC/BT and was still part of the commentary team as coverage switched to Eurosport/Quest in 2019. \nThe rest of the commentary team has included BDO players Bobby George, Martin Adams, Trina Gulliver, Tony O'Shea and Scott Mitchell.\nFor several years between 1989 and 2001, the Championship was often the only tournament shown on terrestrial television in the UK.\nFrom 2005, viewers were able to see every dart live at the World Championship, when the BBC introduced interactive coverage on its BBC Red Button service. From 2012, they began to reduce their coverage as they surrendered their exclusive coverage for the first time in the UK. ESPN took over the live broadcasting of the evening sessions, although the BBC held on to exclusively live coverage of the final.\nThe BBC regained exclusive coverage for the 2014 tournament, but resumed a shared broadcasting agreement to cover the 2015 and 2016 events with BT who covered every evening session in the tournament. John Rawling, Vassos Alexander, Tony Green and George Riley provided the commentary for both broadcasters in 2015 and 2016 - Jim Proudfoot was an additional commentator in 2015.\nThe BBC contract expired after the 2016 final and they opted to drop the tournament, instead covering a new PDC tournament, the Champions League of Darts in September 2016. The free-to-air rights from 2017 were taken up by Channel 4.\nESPN.\nAfter being broadcast exclusively on the BBC in the UK for 34 years, ESPN began sharing coverage of the tournament in 2012. Ray Stubbs was confirmed as their host. ESPN host Nat Coombs was also part of the presentation team. Both broadcasters used the same commentary team – Tony Green, David Croft and Vassos Alexander for 2012 and Jim Proudfoot replacing Croft for 2013. ESPN broadcast the evening sessions from the opening day until the quarter finals, as well as the second semi-final live. ESPN showed recorded highlights of the final. Following the launch of BT Sport, which acquired all of ESPN's sporting rights, coverage was dropped from ESPN and the entire 2014 championship was shown exclusively live by the BBC.\nBT Sport.\nBT Sport covered the event between 2015 and 2018, first of all sharing broadcasting arrangements with the BBC in 2015 and 2016, then with Channel 4 in 2017 and 2018. They had exclusive live coverage of all the evening sessions, plus the second semi-final across their four years broadcasting the event. BT broadcast the final live in all four years of the coverage, although it was shared live coverage with their broadcast partners (BBC 2015-2016 and Channel 4 2017-2018)\nBT Sport welcomed back Ray Stubbs as main host in 2015 and 2016, who returned to Lakeside coverage having fronted the BBC's coverage in 1999 and from 2001–2009 and also for ESPN (2012-2013). Stubbs hosted alongside 2-time champion Ted Hankey who returned to the BDO in 2014 but just missed out on a qualifying spot for Lakeside 2015. Roving reporters were Helen Skelton in 2015 and Reshmin Chowdhury in 2016. Commentators were shared by broadcasters during BT's four year coverage. John Rawling and Vassos Alexander broadcast commentary throughout BT's four-year coverage, Jim Proudfoot covered the event in 2015, 2017 and 2018. George Riley and Tony Green covered the event in 2015 and 2016, with Green retiring after the 2016 event, after the BBC ended their coverage.\nRay Stubbs left BT Sport for Talksport 2 during 2016, and was replaced by Matt Smith for the 2017 and 2018 events, with Chris Mason acting as their analyst.\nChannel 4.\nChannel 4 signed a two-year deal to cover the 2017 and 2018 championships, sharing the event with BT Sport. Their coverage was presented by Rob Walker, alongside PDC professional Paul Nicholson and BDO Ladies' player Deta Hedman. Bobby George presented features. Commentary was provided again from Jim Proudfoot, John Rawling &amp; Vassos Alexander. \nEurosport and Quest.\nPrior to the 2019 championship, the BDO secured a new 3-year deal with Eurosport with coverage being shown on both the broadcasters main subscription channel and free-to-air on Quest. As with the previous years the afternoon sessions were shown free to air with Quest simulcasting Eurosport coverage with highlights of the evening sessions also being shown on Quest. Eurosport covered every session with both broadcasters showing the final live. The coverage was presented by Nat Coombs with Georgie Bingham also reporting on the event. Punditry and commentary for the tournament were provided by John Rawling, Chris Mason, Paul Nicholson, Martin Adams and Tony O'Shea. The Eurosport contract finished 1 year early due to the BDO going into liquidation in September 2020.\nInternational coverage.\nDutch television station SBS6 broadcast the event since 1998, as Dutch players have become more prominent in the world game. SBS6's contract to cover the event ran until 2008.\nViewing figures.\nUK viewing figures for World Championship final data provided by the Broadcasters' Audience Research Board UK."

        "title": "The University Match (cricket)",
        "text": "The University Match in a cricketing context is generally understood to refer to the annual fixture between Oxford University Cricket Club and Cambridge University Cricket Club.\nUntil 2001, when first-class cricket was reorganised, the University Match was a three-day first-class fixture, played at Lord's. Subsequently, it was replaced with a one-day University Match played at Lord's and a four-day first-class fixture played alternately at Fenner's and The Parks. The 2021 one-day match was the last to be played at Lord's and from 2022, the one-day University Match has been played at Arundel Castle. One-off twenty over matches for men and women were arranged at Lords in 2022. In February 2022, the MCC announced that from 2023, the twenty over fixtures would no longer be held at Lord's. Following opposition from a section of its membership, the club decided that the twenty over matches would continue to be held at Lord's in 2023 to allow time for further consultation. In March, 2023 it was announced that the twenty over fixture would continue to be played at Lord's until at least 2027, following which there would be a review and a possible vote in 2028 on whether the matches should remain at Lord's.\nThese twenty over matches are not to be confused with the 'University Matches' for which colours are awarded. Cambridge award a blue for both the one-day and four-day games and Oxford award a blue for the four-day game only. Blues are not awarded for the twenty over match. At the same time, Oxford players have also played in the Oxford University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Oxford UCCE, also including Oxford Brookes University, now superseded by the Oxford MCCU), and Cambridge players in the Cambridge University Centre of Cricketing Excellence (Cambridge UCCE, including Anglia Ruskin University and now the Cambridge MCCU). However, only those at Oxford and Cambridge Universities are eligible to play in the University Match(es).\nThe four-day match lost its first-class status after the 2020 fixture.\nHistory.\nThe match was first played in 1827, at Lord's, at the instigation of Charles Wordsworth who was also responsible for founding the Boat Race in 1829. The next two University matches were in 1829 and 1836. From 1838 it has been played annually, except for the war years of 1915–1918 and 1940–45. (From 1941 to 1945, a one-day fixture was played at Lord's, but these matches are not counted in the official records.) Lord's was to become its permanent venue from 1851 to 2000, but five of the early matches were played in the vicinity of Oxford.\nIt was traditionally an annual three-day first-class fixture. From the 1830s until 1939, it was among the most important fixtures of the season, attracting large crowds and widespread press coverage. It was still a major social, as well as sporting, event as recently as just after World War II . According to \"The Cricketer\" (1954), the 1954 match attracted over 13,000 paying spectators as well as MCC members.\nIn terms of the clubs concerned, the University Match was the oldest first-class fixture still being played in 2020, its final year with first-class status. Matches between county teams prior to formation of the current county clubs have a longer history, with the oldest known county fixture between Kent and Surrey, which dates back to 1709 at least.\nDespite never matriculating, Tom Wills was allowed to play for Cambridge in the 1856 match. He went on to found Australian rules football and coach the first Australian cricket team to tour England.\nSome of the most dramatic matches in the long history of the fixture occurred in the 1870s. The first of these was 'Cobden's Match' in 1870. F. C. Cobden took the last three Oxford wickets in consecutive balls to give Cambridge victory by 2 runs. The following year S. E. Butler took 10–38 in the Cambridge first innings (the only instance of a bowler taking all ten), followed by five more wickets in the second innings. In 1873 Oxford won by only three wickets. The 1875 match was almost as close an affair as that in 1870. Needing 175 to win, Cambridge were 161–7 at one point, but were all out for 168 to lose by six runs.\nAnother notable match was in 1923, which became known as the \"Thunderstorm match\". Oxford had run up a good score, and a torrential storm for much of the night rendered the pitch almost unplayable, so that Cambridge were quickly dismissed in two innings.\nWilliam Yardley of Cambridge has the distinction of scoring the first two hundreds made in the series: 100 in 1870 in Cobden's Match and 130 in 1872.\nRobin Marlar's bowling figures for Cambridge are worth noting:\nPlayers who became (or in a few instances were already) famous to have appeared in the match include: Alfred Lyttelton (Cantab. 1876–9), Allan Steel (Cantab. 1878–81), Stanley Jackson (Cantab. 1890–3), C. B. Fry (Ox. 1892–5), K. S. Ranjitsinhji (Cantab. 1893), Pelham Warner (Ox. 1895–6), Gilbert Jessop (Cantab. 1896–9), R. E. Foster (Ox. 1897–1900), Bernard Bosanquet (Ox. 1898–1900), Percy Chapman (Cantab. 1920–2), Douglas Jardine (Ox. 1920–1, 1923), Gubby Allen (Cantab. 1922–3), K. S. Duleepsinhji (Cantab. 1925–8), Nawab of Pataudi snr (Ox. 1929–31), Ken Farnes (Cantab. 1931–3), Martin Donnelly (Ox. 1946–7), Abdul Kardar (Ox. 1947–9), Peter May (Cantab. 1950–2), David Sheppard (Cantab. 1950–2), Colin Cowdrey (Ox. 1952–4), M. J. K. Smith (Ox. 1954–6), Ted Dexter (Cantab. 1956–8), Nawab of Pataudi jnr (Ox. 1960–1, 1963), Tony Lewis Cantab 1960–62), Mike Brearley (Cantab. 1961–4), Majid Khan (Cantab. 1971–3), Imran Khan (Ox. 1973–5) and Mike Atherton (Cantab. 1987, 1989). It can be seen that the majority were batsmen rather than bowlers and that the 1890s and 1950s to early 1960s were particularly fertile periods. At the time of writing, the most recent Oxbridge international cricketers are Ed Smith (Cantab. 1996–7) in Tests, and James Dalrymple (Ox. 2001–3) in limited-overs internationals.\nFrom 2001 the match has been replaced by two fixtures each year: a one-day match played at Lord's and a four-day fixture (first-class up to and including 2020) played in alternate years at Fenner's in Cambridge and The Parks in Oxford. Blues are awarded to those appearing in either match for Cambridge players but only to Oxford players who appear in the four-day game. Unless otherwise stated, statistics quoted in this article are for the first-class fixtures only.\nIn 2008, for the first time a Twenty20 fixture was also played.\nThe 2020 four-day match was delayed until September because of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRecords.\nResults.\nUp to and including 2020, 176 first-class matches were scheduled. Cambridge won 61, Oxford won 58, 56 were drawn and one match (in 1988) was abandoned without a ball being bowled. From 2021, whilst no longer first-class, the four-day University Match has been played under first-class conditions and has been won once by Cambridge with 2 draws.\nThe one-day University Match has been scheduled on 22 occasions. Cambridge won 8, Oxford won 12 and three have been abandoned."

The Swedish Cricket Federation is an associate member of the International Cricket Council. In 1998, there were approx. 500 registered cricket players in Sweden. In 2016 Radio Sweden reported there was an estimated 55 teams and 3,000 registered players; the surge, similar to that in Germany, has been attributed to an influx of immigrants from Afghanistan and other cricket-loving countries. The social side of the game has been praised for its ability to integrate new arrivals. In 2015 the Swedish Cricket Federation joined the Swedish Sports Confederation. While gaining in popularity, it is said that the game still lags behind cricket in Norway in popularity.\nHistory.\nIn 1883 the first cricket club, Lyckans Samfund, was founded in Gothenburg by cricket enthusiasts. The oldest cricket club founded in modern times in Sweden is the Stockholm Cricket Club.\nDevelopment of cricket was slow during the 1950s and 1960s, with players predominantly being expats. Since the 1970s growth of cricket in Sweden has been tied to waves of immigration and refugees settling in Sweden, with Ugandan Indians, Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi, Pakistani, most recently Afghani immigrants driving the increase in playing numbers.\nThe Swedish Cricket Federation was formed in 1990. In 1991 the Swedish Cricket Federation joined the ICC and was made an affiliate member in 1997. The Swedish Cricket Federation was accepted as the 71st member of the Swedish Sports Confederation () in 2015.\nNational Team.\nThe Sweden national cricket teams represent the Kingdom of Sweden in international cricket. Sweden is represented by teams for Men, Women and U19.\nClub Cricket.\nThere are 70 cricket clubs in Sweden affiliated to the Swedish Cricket Federation. Currently 56 play in the Cricket Ligan - the national club cricket competition in Sweden for One Day, T20 and T10 formats. Cricket Ligan’s highest division is the Allsvenskan, under which are 2 levels of regional competitions. The winner of the Swedish T10 competition is eligible to represent Sweden in the European Cricket League."

The telecast included portion of a contest between the Chicago Cubs vs. the Philadelphia Phillies from Wrigley Field with Jack Brickhouse commentating on WGN-TV.\n1969.\nBy 1969, the usage of chroma key (in which the commentators would open a telecast by standing in front of a greenscreen composite of the stadiums' crowds) became a common practice for baseball telecasts.\n1970s.\n1975.\nIn the bottom of the 12th inning of Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at Boston's Fenway Park, Red Sox catcher Carlton Fisk was facing Cincinnati Reds pitcher Pat Darcy. Fisk then hit a pitch down the left field line that appeared to be heading to foul territory. The enduring image of Fisk jumping and waving the ball fair as he made his way to first base is arguably one of baseball's greatest moments. The ball struck the foul pole, giving the Red Sox a 7–6 win and forcing a seventh and deciding game of the Fall Classic. During this time, cameramen covering baseball games were instructed to follow the flight of the ball; reportedly, Fisk's reaction was only being recorded because NBC cameraman Lou Gerard, positioned inside Fenway's scoreboard at the base of the left-field Green Monster wall, had become distracted by a large rat. This play was perhaps the most important catalyst in getting camera operators to focus most of their attention on the players themselves.\n1980s.\n1983.\nOn July 6, 1983, NBC televised the All-Star Game out of Chicago's Comiskey Park. During the telecast, special guest analyst, Don Sutton helped introduce NBC's new pitching tracking device dubbed The NBC Tracer. \"The NBC Tracer\" was a stroboscopic comet tail showing the path of a pitch to the catcher's glove. For instance, \"The NBC Tracer\" helped track a Dave Stieb curveball among others.\n1985.\nIn 1985, NBC's telecast of the All-Star Game out of the Metrodome in Minnesota was the first program to be broadcast in stereo by a television network.\n1987.\nFor the 1987 World Series between the Minnesota Twins and St. Louis Cardinals, ABC utilized 12 cameras and nine tape machines. This includes cameras positioned down the left field line, on the roof of the Metrodome, and high above third base.\n1990s.\n1990.\nIn 1990, CBS took over from both ABC and NBC as Major League Baseball's national, over-the-air television provider. They in the process brought along their telestration technology that they dubbed CBS Chalkboard. \"CBS Chalkboard\" made its debut eight years earlier during CBS' coverage of Super Bowl XVI.\n1992.\nFor CBS' coverage of the 1992 All-Star Game, they introduced Basecam, a lipstick-size camera, inside first base.\n1993.\nDuring CBS' coverage of the 1993 World Series, umpires were upset with the overhead replays being televised by CBS. Dave Phillips, the crew chief, said just prior to Game 2 that the umpires want \"CBS to be fair with their approach.\"\nRick Gentile, the senior vice president for production of CBS Sports, said that Richie Phillips, the lawyer for the Major League Umpires Association, tried to call the broadcast booth during Saturday's game, but the call was not put through. Richie Phillips apparently was upset when Dave Phillips called the Philadelphia Phillies' Ricky Jordan out on strikes in the fourth inning, and a replay showed the pitch to be about 6 inches outside.\nNational League President Bill White, while using a CBS headset in the broadcast booth during Game 1, was overheard telling Gentile and the producer Bob Dekas: \n1997.\nOn July 8, 1997, Fox televised its first ever All-Star Game (out of Jacobs Field in Cleveland). For this particular game, Fox introduced \"Catcher-Cam\" in which a camera was affixed to the catchers' masks in order to provide unique perspectives of the action around home plate. Catcher-Cam soon would become a regular fixture in Fox's baseball broadcasts.\nIn addition to Catcher-Cam, other innovations (some of which have received more acclaim than others) that Fox has provided for baseball telecasts have been:\n2000s.\n2000.\nFor a Saturday afternoon telecast of a Los Angeles Dodgers/Chicago Cubs game at Wrigley Field on August 26, 2000, Fox aired a special \"Turn Back the Clock\" broadcast to commemorate the 61st anniversary of the first televised baseball game. The broadcast started with a re-creation of the television technology of 1939, with play-by-play announcer Joe Buck working alone with a single microphone, a single black-and-white camera, and no graphics; then, each subsequent half-inning would see the broadcast \"jump ahead in time\" to a later era, showing the evolving technologies and presentation of network baseball coverage through the years.\n2002.\nIn October 2002, Fox televised the first ever World Series to be shown in high definition.\n2004.\nStarting in 2004, some TBS telecasts (mostly Fridays or Saturdays) became more enhanced. The network decided to call it Braves TBS Xtra. Enhancements included catcher cam, \"Xtra Motion\", which featured the type of pitch and movement, also \"leadOff Line\". It would also show features with inside access to players.\nIn October 2004, Fox started airing all Major League Baseball postseason broadcasts (including the League Championship Series and World Series) in high definition. Fox also started airing the Major League Baseball All-Star Game in HD the following year. At the same time, the FoxBox and graphics are upgraded.\n2007.\nFor their 2007 Division Series coverage, TBS debuted various new looks, such as the first live online views from cameras in dugouts and ones focused on pitchers. TBS also introduced a graphic that creates sort of a rainbow to trace the arc of pitches on game replays. The graphic was superimposed in the studio so analysts like Cal Ripken Jr. for instance, could take virtual cuts at pitches thrown in games.\n2009.\nDuring their 2009 playoff coverage, TBS displays their \"PitchTrax\" graphic full-time during at-bats (with the center field camera only) during the high-definition version of the broadcast in the extreme right-hand corner of the screen.\nMeanwhile, for their own 2009 playoff coverage, Fox announced that they would occasionally include this stat on replays: Speed of pitches as they leave pitchers' hands as well as their speed when they cross home plate.\n2010s.\n2011.\nWith the start of the 2011 postseason, TBS planned to introduce the following\nThe screen on TBS's standard definition feed now airs a letterboxed version of the native HD feed to match Fox's default widescreen SD presentation, allowing the right side pitch tracking graphic to be seen by SD viewers.\nFor the 2011 World Series, Fox debuted infrared technology that's designed to pinpoint heat made by a ball making contact — with, say, bats, face masks, players' bodies — and mark the spot for viewers by making it glow. During Game 1, Fox used \"Hot Spot\" to show that a batted ball was fouled off Texas Rangers batter Adrián Beltré's foot.\n2012.\nFox's 2012 World Series coverage would include a camera whose replays could generate as many as 20,000 frames per second, the most ever seen on Fox—and up from about 60 frames per second on regular replays. The camera would allow viewers \"to see the ball compress\" when batted, similar to how cameras now show golf balls getting compressed when struck. The technology for the camera originated with the U.S. military looking at replays of missile impacts.\n2016.\nAt the beginning of the 2016 season, TBS introduced new graphics that were used all season including the postseason.\nThe score box, which was originally docked to the top and left edges of the screen, was completely redesigned for 2017 after much criticism during the 2016 postseason for its large size. Like the 2016 score bug, the current one still stands in the top left corner, only it is smaller.\n2020s.\n2020.\nThe 2020 season was delayed until July due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Fox soon announced that they would virtually fill the seats of Chicago's Wrigley Field, Los Angeles' Dodger Stadium, Washington's Nationals Park, San Diego's Petco Park and other ballparks that it broadcasts games over the next several weeks. Announcers later spent time explaining and demonstrating the use of virtual fans during the July 25 game between the Chicago Cubs-Milwaukee Brewers at Wrigley Field."

The tournament began with the qualifying rounds featuring Botswana Division One teams. Only 32 Division One teams progressed and faced off in the extra preliminary round, with the winners playing against the top 16 Botswana First Division teams in the preliminary round. Botswana Premier League teams entered directly in the first round (the round of 32) to face the winners of the preliminary round.\nOn 3 December 2018 it was announced that the tournament would now be played by 48 teams.\nThe premier league sides automatically qualify for the round of 32 whereas the top eight finishers from either First Division league face off with 16 Division One teams from regional playoffs. From the round of 32 onwards teams are not seeded. Games which end in a draw after 90 minutes plus added time are subject to extra time and penalties if necessary.

        "text": "Czechoslovakia, formally the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France.\nThe team consisted of 74 athletes, which was the largest number at that time. It was the last time Czechoslovakia participated in the Winter Olympics, because the state split to Czech Republic and Slovakia and both countries entered their independent teams to the 1994 Winter Olympics.\nCross-country skier Pavel Benc was the flag-bearer of the country in the opening ceremony.\nCompetitors.\nThe following is the list of number of competitors in the Games.\nAlpine skiing.\nCzechoslovakia's participation in the alpine skiing races was done by four skiers, all Slovaks. Lucia Medzihradská was the most successful of them reaching top eight in the women's combined event.\nBiathlon.\nJiřina Adamičková was close to winning a medal in the women's sprint, fighting for it after last shooting, but fading fast in the closing uphill section and falling down to fifth place, seven seconds behind bronze-medal Belova of the Unified Team.\nBobsleigh.\nAfter many years, Czechoslovakia entered its Olympic bobsleigh teams again, which recorded average to below-average results, but improved fast to be strong competitors at the 1994 Winter Olympics.\nCross-country skiing.\nThe men's 50-kilometer freestyle marathon was the highlight of Czechoslovakia's men. Radim Nyč and Pavel Benc finished in top eight. Václav Korunka missed the top ten, but recorded three top-20 performances. In women's races Alžběta Havrančíková performed great in the second, freestyle-pursuit part of the combination race to move up from 34th to 17th place. Young Kateřina Neumannová took part in her first Olympics. The strong Czech and Slovak team-up of the women's relay fought for medals before losing pace in the last stage run by Iveta Zelingerová.\nFigure skating.\nReigning European Champion Petr Barna won his only Olympic medal behind Ukraine's Viktor Petrenko and United States' Paul Wylie. During his free program, Barna was the first skater to land the quadruple jump in the Olympic competition. The program was choreographed on the Hamlet soundtrack and was Barna's artistic masterpiece.\nRadka Kovaříková and René Novotný teamed up after Novotný's 1988 Winter Olympics medicine problem. They beat Shishkova and Naumov of the Unified Team in the competition, but lost to Isabelle Brasseur and Lloyd Eisler of Canada in a close battle for the bronze medal, feeling a sort of injustice.\nKateřina Mrázová and Martin Šimeček finished 10th in the ice-dancing competition, while Lenka Kulovaná finished 11th. She was fifth in the 1992 European Championships, but lost to two European opponents only in Albertville.\nIce hockey.\nIn 1991, Czechoslovakia failed to win a medal at the World Championships in Finland. Stanislav Neveselý and Josef Horešovský were sacked and the team was coached by Ivan Hlinka in Albertville. He named ten members of the 1991 World Championships for their Olympic squad. The team entered the group hammering Norway and coming back from 0-2 against France. Robert Lang's two goals helped beat Unified Team, which was the only one loss of the later Olympic champions. Czechoslovakia itself then recorded its first loss against Canada, but confirmed their quarterfinals participation with a win over Switzerland.\nSweden, the reigning World Champions, met Czechoslovakia in the quarterfinals, but was beaten as Kadlec, Janecký and Augusta scored their goals and Czechoslovakia headed to the semifinals against Canada again. The game was more balanced than the group one, but was lost 2-4. The team however had not problems finding motivation to beat United States for the bronze medal. Robert Lang was the top scoring player of the team (13 points).\n&lt;br&gt;\nLuge.\nPetr Urban was the leading and most controversial member of the Czechoslovakia's luge team. He recorded two top-20 finishes, but was soon excluded from the team because of his cartoon jokes he published in daily Sport while competing in Albertville.\nSki jumping.\nJiří Parma was Czechoslovakia's flag-bearer at the 1988 Winter Olympics, but recorded his best ever Olympic results in 1992. He led the team in a dramatic competition, where only Czechoslovakia managed to get closer to the uncontested duo of Austria and gold medal winning Finland. He added large hill fifth place and normal hill 10th place.\nSpeed skating.\nOnly two Czechoslovakia's speed skaters took part in the Games, but none of them was able to fight the competition for better than low-place finishes."

They finished in eighth place in this tournament, which originally meant a demotion to Division Four in the newly expanded five division European Championship. \nHowever, when the divisions were announced, the Isle of Man had a place in Division Three for 2007. As they had a year without competitive international cricket in 2006, the Isle of Man arranged two one-day friendly matches against Spain played at La Manga Club Ground at the end of September/beginning of October, both of which they won.\nIn 2007 under Webber, Jones and coach Harvey Anderson, they finished third in the European Division Three, defeating Belgium, Malta (twice) &amp; Cyprus.

        "text": "Gardner's climbing mouse (Rhipidomys gardneri) is a rodent species from South America. It is found in western Brazil, southeastern Peru and northeastern Bolivia. It is an uncommon, arboreal species, but faces no particular threats so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being a \"least-concern species\".\nDescription.\nGardner's climbing mouse is one of the larger members of the genus, with a head-and-body length of and a tail rather longer than the body. The dorsal fur is short and rather coarse, varying in colour from grey to orange-brown, each hair being banded. The underparts are yellowish, the hairs on the throat and in the centre of the chest having grey bases. The tail is dark brown, clad in short hairs with a short tuft of hairs at the tip. The ears are rounded and of medium size. The dark patch on the upper surface of the large hind feet does not extend onto the toes.\nDistribution and habitat.\nGardner's climbing mouse is native to southeastern Peru and Acre State, the most westerly state in Brazil, as well as the northeasterly part of Bolivia. It occurs in both primary and secondary forest, and its altitudinal range is between or more. It occurs in the drainages of the Rivers Juruá, Ucayeli, Madre de Dios and Beni.\nStatus.\nGardiner's climbing mouse has a wide range but is believed to be an uncommon species. Nevertheless, besides its forest home it has adapted to many disturbed and man-made habitats, including the thatched roofs of houses, and one female was found nursing young in the drawer of a piece of furniture. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being of \"least concern\"."

Between 1994 and 1996 they competed in the Lion Red Cup competition, while in 2008 and 2009 they competed in the Bartercard Premiership.\nHistory.\nEarly Efforts.\nIn 1921 former New Zealand international George Iles moved from Auckland to live in Tauranga. In 1922 he was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the Tauranga area. The Tauranga Rugby League was started in March, 1922 and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team. On the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby league played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29–28.\nAfter this match the first ever Bay of Plenty rugby league team was selected to play against the touring New South Wales side. The Bay of Plenty team featured George Iles, along with future Kiwis George Gardiner and Hec McDonald while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of Frank Burge and Reg Latta. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with David Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team.\nEfforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play the Bay of Plenty side in Tauranga on October 7. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side who went down 27–33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as Clarrie Polson, Wally Somers, and future Kiwi's Lou Brown, Neville St George, and Jim O'Brien.\nLion Red Cup.\nThe Lion Red Cup team was coached by Neil Joyce and Lawrence Brydon and collected two wooden spoon's, in 1994 and 1995. However, in 1996 they finished fifth, losing the elimination playoff. Notable players included Alex Chan.\nThe Stags drew players from both the Bay of Plenty Rugby League and the Coastlines Rugby League competitions.\nBartercard Cup.\nBetween 2004 and 2008 they were represented by the Waicoa Bay Stallions in the Bartercard Cup. The Stallions represented the Waikato Rugby League and Coastlines Rugby League as well as the Bay of Plenty Rugby League.\nBartercard Premiership.\nIn 2008 and 2009 the Bay of Plenty provincial side competed in the National Provincial Competition. Former Kiwis coach Graham Lowe was the coach of the side for 2008. In 2009 they did not win a game and finished sixth."

        "text": "Frank \"Muddy\" Waters (January 30, 1923 – September 20, 2006) was an American football player and coach. He served as the head coach at Hillsdale College (1954–1973), Saginaw Valley State University (1975–1979), and Michigan State University (1980–1982), compiling a career college football record of 173–96–7. Waters was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame as a coach in 2000.\nEarly years and playing career.\nWaters was born in Chico, California and grew up in Wallingford, Connecticut. He attended Pawling School in Pawling, New York. He was both football and track captain at the Choate School, from which he graduated in 1943, and where he was inducted into the Athletics Hall of Fame in 2004. He played fullback for Michigan State from 1946 to 1949 under coaches Charlie Bachman and Clarence Munn.\nCoaching career.\nHillsdale.\nHis Hillsdale Chargers teams won 34 consecutive games from 1953 to 1957 while participating in the Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association. In 1955, his 9–0 team refused to play in the Tangerine Bowl when game officials prohibited the team's black players from participating. He was named NAIA Coach of the Year in 1957, a year in which the team played in the Holiday Bowl and was chosen by the Washington D.C. Touchdown Club as the best small college team in the country. In his final year at the school, its stadium was renamed \"Frank 'Muddy' Waters Stadium.\"\nSaginaw Valley State.\nAfter leaving Hillsdale with a 138–47–5 record, Waters went on to serve as the first head coach of the Saginaw Valley State University Cardinals from 1975 to 1979, posting a 25–26–2 record and capturing a Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title in his final season.\nMichigan State.\nIn 1980, Michigan State hired Waters as head football coach after an NCAA probation. Waters coached for three seasons, but got fired after a 10–23 record in three seasons. Despite his firing just before the last game of the season, Waters was popular enough with players and fans to be carried off the field after his final 24–18 loss to Iowa.\nLater life and death.\nAfter leaving MSU's head coach position, Waters continued to live in East Lansing and participated as a member of the MSU community for the next two decades. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000 in the Small College category. Waters died of congestive heart failure at age 83 in Saginaw, Michigan."

        "title": "Par (golf scoring format)",
        "text": "Par, or bogey, is a scoring system used mostly in amateur and club golf. It is a stroke play format played against the course, with match play scoring based on the number of strokes taken on each hole compared to a fixed score, usually the par or bogey; in this context, bogey is meant in the traditional sense as the score a good player would expect on the hole, usually par but occasionally one stroke more. The winner of the competition is the player with the highest differential of holes \"won\" to holes \"lost\", with the result on each hole normally based on the players handicap-adjusted score.\nPar has similarities to the popular Stableford scoring system in that competition is against the course on a hole-by-hole basis, and the occasional very bad hole does not massively affect the overall result. Because of this it also has the same advantage of improving pace of play in large club competitions as holing out is not required once the hole is lost. Unlike Stableford however, there is no reward for a handicap-adjusted eagle (or better)."
